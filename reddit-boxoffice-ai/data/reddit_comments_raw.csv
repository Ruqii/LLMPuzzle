I previously went to Sun Rise Records, but last night I went to check out some movies and they had up to DOUBLED the prices on most movies. LOTR went from $79 to $149, Interstellar, The Batman, Dune 1/2 were all upped to almost $40. Breaking Bad was up to $160.

I know Chernobyl is a mini-series and it’s the latest show I watched and I was quite fascinated by it given that I have a Physics background academically.



Could you guys recommend me similar style movies that involves nuclear phenomena, or a post-apocalyptic survival drama (say like Mad Max) or science fiction in general? 



I’ve already watched Predestination, Interstellar, Edge of Tomorrow, Mad Max (both Fury Road and Furiosa saga), Hunger Games, Pearl Harbor, Oppenheimer, Dunes, Lucy, Snowpiercer, Inception, Parasite etc. These are the kind of movies I like.

dune2,dune 2,1jk28ri,Is it possible that Denis Villeneuve is adapting Children of Dune as the source material for the third Dune movie?,"I'm admittedly not very up to date when it comes to production news, but I didn't see a whole lot in terms of detail for news on the production of the third Dune film. I recently started reading the Dune books and I just don't see Messiah as being a particularly good movie adaptation. Coupled with the tease of Anya Taylor Joy as Alia, its a huge stretch to cast her in a Messiah adaptation, especially since Villeneuve changed things so that she wasn't even born yet at the end of Dune 2.

Dune 3 is going to require a time jump either way and a good bit of the principle cast don't really play much of a role (or even appear really) in Messiah, nor does it really lend itself to the scope of what we've come to expect from the Dune films visually or narratively. I think Children of Dune has a lot more to offer. I liked Messiah, but at no point was I like ""wow, I sure can't wait to see this depicted on the big screen."". I could absolutely see the broad strokes of Dune Messiah being incorporated as the first 1/3 of a 3 hour film, but they me there's just much more to bring to the big screen in Children of Dune.

It just feels like it's been a while since I saw a movie that I legit ""I have to tell people about this"" last one I can remember was ""Late Night With The Devil"" I don't go to the theater as often as I would like, and it feels like theres really nothing on streaming. And before that the last one would probably be Bullet Train

This isn't happening with TV shows, I don't settle for a mediocre TV show, I loved Dune Prophecy and THAT gave me ""People must know"" vibes and I'm so hyped it's renewed.

dune2,dune 2,1je5r6v,200 Movies I have never seen (part 3),"My goal this year is to watch 200 movies I have never seen before. As I go I am ranking them 1-10, and writing a few words on them. I'm not a movie critic, and my ratings are based on how much I enjoyed the film. Feel free to ask me anything, and give input and/or suggestions! I will be posting updates to this list of mine every 25 movies I watch.

Below is the link to part 2 of my list:

https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/s/0Ctv8ExzX2

51. Interstellar: 8/10. Beautiful. Didnt feel as long as it was. Lost me a few times. Highly deserving of multiple viewings.

52. Casino Royale (2006): 7/10. I like craig more than pierce or dalton, so far. I miss some of the cheesy tropes.

53. Quantum of solace: 6/10. Forgettable. i forgot about this movie 10 minutes after finishing it.

54. Skyfall: 8/10. Bardem is excellent. the ending was great. best bond movie in a long time.

55. Spectre: 7/10. Weak start, but i like how this one felt more ""bondy"". christoph waltz is a good blofeld.

56. No time to die: 6/10. Too long. Didnt care for the end. Wtf, you know? 

57. Falling down: 5/10. I liked the ending. Didnt take much from this movie.

58. Do the right thing: 9/10. I love the loose narrative and characters. Difficult ending.

59. The whale: 7/10. Frasier was great. Didnt care for alot of the other performances. I especially thought the daughters dialogue was groan inducing.

60. Schindlers list: 9/10. Probably my favorite Neeson movie. Just all around horrific. It was long, and it felt long.

61. Life of brian: 6/10. Funny. Some of the bits just go on and on and on. Also, its so british i genuinely needed subtitles.

62. Creep: 6/10. Made me laugh alot, even when i dont think it was trying to. i liked the killer.

63. The royal tenenbaums: 10/10.

64. Dune (2021): 8/10. Visually fantastic. So much easier to follow than lynchs dune, not to mention easier to look at. Not huge on chalamet.

65. Dune part 2: 8/10. Better performance from chalamet. great ending. Excited for messiah.

66. King of new york: 5/10. It gave me no reason to care about any of the characters, or how it would end. i liked walken and fishburne.

67. The loveless: 6/10. Stylish. Nice and short. i love willem dafoe.

68. The boondock saints: 7/10. Very funny, and stupid in a good way. Defoe rules, as usual. Not crazy about the ending, and i hated the music.

69. At eternitys gate: 7/10. Visually beautiful. Great (again) performance from defoe. felt longer than it was.

70. Freddy got fingered: 7/10. One of the most vile and stupid movies i have ever seen. Tom green is annoying, but i genuinely laughed a ton during this.

71. A fistful of dollars: 9/10. Stylish and effortlessly cool. excellent story and characters. excellent soundtrack.

72. For a few dollars more: 8/10. Fantastic, sadistic villain. Lee van cleef is the man.

73. Oppenheimer: 8/10. Cillian murphy was great. I liked the non linear telling of the story, which i think helped make the movies length more bearable.

74. Suspiria (2018): 6/10. Some really cool shots. Swinton is excellent. The ending went to complete shit. Too damn long.

75. Heat: 8/10. A small army of great performances and characters that had me rooting for both teams. Henry rollins jumpscare!

dune2,dune 2,1j1yxzg,"The Oscars are tonight! Here are the 42 movies I watched that were released in 2024, all ranked with mini-reviews.","Before getting into the list, here are the movies that I still want to watch:

**42. Lisa Frankenstein - 3.75/10** 

Great aesthetics, but a total mess. Felt like three different scripts mashed together. Incomprehensible character arcs. Really enjoyed the first thirty minutes or so, which made the second and third acts all the more disappointing and confusing.

**41. They Called Him Mostly Harmless - 4/10** 

An Instagram reel worth of info spread out across 2 hours.

**40. Stopmotion - 4/10** 

Booooring. I like stop motion, and it is a cool concept to base a horror flick around, but it’s never used in a particularly interesting way. I think the director thought the concept of stop motion animation was in and of itself much more creepy than it actually comes across. There is VERY limited usage that felt interesting/unsettling, but it’s a section that only lasts about a minute. Slow burn and the payoff is nill.

**39. Juror #2 - 4.5/10** 

Not a fan of the way Eastwood usually writes dialog. Felt like a soap opera. Similar to *12 Angry Men*, it’s a “grown up” legal drama that expects you not to really have an understanding of the way juries work. Which is fine, but the on-screen happenings have to be interesting, and this was far from that. Very impressed that he's still making movies though!

**38. Love Lies Bleeding - 5.25/10**

Well done and well acted with some cool symbolism/surrealistic elements woven in, but I just didn’t find it to be an interesting enough story. Never felt invested or hooked. And, even though it is very slowly paced, the dynamics between characters still felt rushed. Liked the style but not the substance - loved the sound design especially. Still, a slog.

**37. Emilia Perez - 5.5/10** 

A potentially special movie marred by a steady stream of kind of baffling errors. There were parts I loved, but the parts that were bad were sophomoric to a point that it was hard for that not to be the main takeaway. Selena Gomez is the perfect representation of what is wrong about this movie. Not only is her acting and accent work absolutely terrible, she seemingly doesn’t even know how a number of the words she’s speaking are supposed to be pronounced. How does a movie with the pedigree and aspirations of this one not course correct something like that?When the film’s at its best, it has this ethereal, beautiful quality to it - like something out of a dream. A number of songs I loved, but more I hated. Some beautiful moments followed up by something so obvious and trite it had my eyes rolling out of my head. A film in extremes.

**36. Maxxxine - 5.75/10** 

Kind of a mess. Very disjointed plotting without a particularly satisfying arc. I do love this character, but it seems like they ran out of material for her.

**35. The Beekeeper - 6/10** 

I love how constant the bee talk, references, and puns are. You’d have thought the studio would have noticed that the line “I’ve got to protect the hive” was repeated ten times in the first 45 mins and told them to turn it down, but this is not that kind of movie. It’s a little too serious to be a full-on parody, which I do think holds it back. Probably would have been a fun short film, gets a little boring.

**34. All We Imagine as Light - 6/10** 

Beautiful, poetic writing, but this thing was pretty brutal to get through. Painfully slow. Appreciated the themes of class consciousness, religion, and sexuality/love in Mumbai, but it just did not hold my attention at all. If you’re into slow cinema, I could see it working for you.

**33. Deadpool and Wolverine - 6.25/10** 

Rewards a lot of inside baseball knowledge of superhero studio politics. I found myself going “oh, I get that” way more than actually chuckling. A lot of references presented as jokes, and even the jokes that were in the movie didn’t really land with me. I did enjoy the relationship built between the two leads. Action was all low or no-stakes.There is an homage to the *Oldboy* hallway scene towards the end, which was more visually interesting than most of the action, but not enough to get me on board. I just think *Deadpool’s* not for me.

**32. Tuesday - 6.25/10** 

Wanted to love it. Beautiful premise/visuals but very strange tonally. Some awkward millennial “so random” kind of humor. Would have worked better if it were more focused on the individuals involved and their relationship. I found *A Monster Calls* to be a much better version of this sort of story.

**31. The Brutalist - 6.25/10** 

Had the aesthetic of a great American epic, but not the substance. Like a kid playing dress-up. I could feel that the director was trying to make an “important” movie - and though I do appreciate the ambition - it felt contrived. Didn’t feel at all new or inventive.Also quite shallow; there were a number of interesting potential story threads, but most were either unexplored or abandoned. The passing of time felt rushed in a way that sometimes meant that we skipped past potentially interesting moments. Very (I’d say comically) dramatic acting without enough actual drama.The score - though underused - was fantastic and the shots really were beautiful and inventive. I did appreciate how unique the story structure was, and how well it would have worked had the material been better. First half was quite a bit better than the second.

**30. Nosferatu - 6.5/10** 

Disappointing; my most anticipated of the year. Can’t overstate how beautiful this movie is to look at. Every frame could be a painting. Unfortunately, it’s so high octane, there’s not space for dread to be built, and it all becomes noise.Characters are constantly - and I mean constantly - acting absolutely terrified. Felt like a beautiful, artsy *Michael Bay* horror flick. The acting style is also clearly intended to mirror the pre-*Brando* “showy” style of acting, but feels distracting and off-puttingly anachronistic in a movie that looks as cutting edge as this one does.

**29. Furiosa - 6.75/10** 

Some cool world-building stuff that I enjoyed, but may have worked better as a TV show to dive deeper into those dynamics. The action sequences felt very glossy and uninspired; huge downgrade from *Fury Road*. This would have been a solid “It’s on TNT, let’s just throw it on” kind of movie from fifteen years ago.

**28. Longlegs - 7/10** 

Nick Cage’s character is the only real standout; he rides the edge of ridiculous and terrifying so well. A bit of a bore outside of his performance, but totally serviceable horror flick.

**27. Woman of the Hour - 7/10** 

Pretty okay! A serial killer movie, where the horror on screen was communicated much more through the way the women were intimidated and demeaned on the way to being killed than the actual kill itself. I didn't feel quite so hit over the head by the message as something like *Promising Young Woman; I* felt like it was mostly handled quite effectively. 

There were definitely some moments - mostly later in the movie - that made me roll my eyes a bit. The scene where *Anna Kendrick* is actually on the show felt like pretty uninspired wish fulfillment. The main character's someone with modern values who gets to clap back at the bad guys, which I find to be a fairly common - if not quite manipulative - way to make the audience feel like the good guy without delving deeper into why things were the way they were in that time. There's a scene towards the end of the movie that really was remarkable in how tense it was; reminded me of some of the better scenes from *Zodiac*.

**26. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice - 7.25/10** 

A bit soulless, but still has some fun moments and cool visuals. Seems like Burton had maybe four different ideas for what he wanted the sequel to be and couldn’t pick any.Monica Bellucci’s role is especially undeveloped and strange. I wish that it had leaned into the weird or over-the-top elements a bit more than it did.

**25. My Old Ass - 7.25/10** 

Sweet little movie. Fun premise and great performances. Not enough forward momentum.

**24. Hundreds of Beavers - 7.25/10** 

Some very fun and funny stuff, but I would have enjoyed it more as a short than as a feature. There’s a reason *Looney Tunes* cartoons aren’t two hours long.Always fun seeing the novel ways indie filmmakers can work around low budgets.

**23. The Wild Robot - 7.5/10** 

Pretty good. Felt very much like a children’s flick, which it is, but didn’t transcend those bounds in the way that a *Monsters Inc.* or *Toy Story* do.All about not fitting in and being yourself, which is basically every children’s movie. Might just be that I’m old and cranky.

**22. Oddity - 7.5/10** 

Solid horror movie with an A+ beginning. Some really creepy imagery.

**21. Didi - 7.5/10** 

Good coming-of-age flick, but I don’t love coming-of-age movies. Clearly very personal to the director. Didn’t resonate as much with me.

**20. Late Night with the Devil - 7.5/10** 

Fun horror flick with a pretty unique setting. Maybe a bit milquetoast, but overall enjoyable.

**19. Kinds of Kindness - 7.75/10** 

Three short films. Might have enjoyed them more individually, as they start to run together a bit. Quite funny and very weird.

**18. I Brake for Caterpillars - 8/10**

Great dark comedy written and directed by my chess buddy, Ken Green.

**17. Dune: Part Two - 8/10**

Beautiful visuals; really does feel epic. I think this movie would work better if viewed immediately after *Part One*, as it can sort of take your breath away with how constant the action is.On its own, it feels like a theme park ride more than it does a film; again, an issue that goes away if marathoned. Villains felt shallow.

**16. Hit Man - 8/10** 

Very fun. Glen Powell oozes charisma. Great range too, came away very impressed by him.Felt like there were some tonal issues where it didn’t know if it wanted to be serious or silly. Quite enjoyable overall.

**15. Caddo Lake - 8/10** 

A puzzle to put together as much as it is a movie. Little context for what’s happening until about an hour through, which made it hard to really feel invested in what was going on. It was very well executed and an interesting premise/mystery, but it does take some concentration, and it was easy to get overwhelmed or confused. The character work all felt great and real.

**14. In the Land of Saints & Sinners - 8/10** 

Great *Liam Neeson* action (adjacent) flick. I saw a lot of parallels between this and *Unforgiven*, though this movie was quite a bit softer.Neeson can chew scenery like no other, and Joffrey was great too. Feel like I can see him being a more buttoned-up *Barry Keoghan* type. Could have used a better group of villains and did feel a bit slow in spots.Surprised by how beautiful this movie was to look at and how much care they put into composition.

**13. A Different Man - 8.25/10** 

Thoughtful commentary on identity and personality. Some subtle *Lynchian* stylings, which I appreciated. Could have been trimmed down.

**12. Speak No Evil - 8.25/10** 

Wonderfully tense. *James McAvoy* may be the best working actor today.Really interesting premise, explores how people are so willing to be polite that they’ll ignore very obvious red flags so as not to ruffle feathers. Really enjoyed the twists and turns (which are totally ruined if you watch the trailer).Feels like logic flies out the window a bit towards the end. One of our protagonists comes out seeming cartoonishly competent and the other cartoonishly incompetent.Curious now to watch the 2022 original.

**11. Strange Darling - 8.25/10** 

Absolutely love the style. Twisted and twisty; keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I love the way that - from the very beginning - the structure makes you feel off balance (the film says it’s 5 chapters and then starts with chapter 3).Female lead was fantastic. Very weak final twenty minutes or so. Not sure if I agree with the film’s overall message/politics.

**10. The First Omen - 8.25/10** 

Very effective satanic horror flick with some really disturbing and interesting set pieces. Legitimately creepy; on par with the original in that regard.Could have benefited from cutting about 30 minutes towards the end. The final act suffers from showing too much and not leaving enough to the imagination.The end was the only section that really felt overtly “fan-servicey,” but it was so overt and awkward that it felt like a post-credit scene in a *Marvel* movie—very weird and silly in this context.Overall, a very good movie that could have been a classic if they had just chopped off the final act.

**9. The Substance - 8.5/10** 

Very fun body horror flick, led by a great performance by *Demi Moore*. Very interesting concept.I didn’t feel it in the moment, but I can see how there are moments that could be really emotionally resonant for certain people watching—all about an unwillingness to deal with aging and the pain that comes with fading beauty. Love how disgusting the camera work makes everything feel. The close-ups of *Dennis Quaid* eating may have been the grossest parts of a very gross body-horror movie.Really interesting how the film satirizes “sex sells” by making the sexual imagery SO over the top. They do some interesting stuff at the end, but I do think it could have used some editing down.The final act of the film lost a fair bit of momentum due to being so drawn out. I’m also tired of the “everything devolves into violence” trope; feels like a cop-out at this point.

**8. Wicked: Part One - 8.5/10** 

Didn’t really want to see it; I saw it on stage and thought it was just okay. Thought it was quite slow to start, but was totally invested by the end.Loved the look and effects. Didn’t feel stretched out. The pauses in the songs all felt natural and cinematic to me. Don’t love the music overall, but a few stood out. *Ariana Grande’s* a great comic actress, and the woman playing *Elphaba* has one of the more expressive faces I’ve seen; she was the perfect actress to get you to feel what she was feeling. A spectacle.

**7. Conclave - 8.75/10** 

Very well acted and shot. Not high art, but a super entertaining/fun political thriller.A lot of the conflict in the film felt small in a way that made everything feel much more grounded and real. I did appreciate the messaging, even if some of the moralizing could feel on the nose.Excited to watch this one again.

**6. Baby Reindeer - 9/10 (Limited series that felt like a 4-hour movie, so here it goes)** 

Loved how raw this felt. Not a conventional story at all with a uniquely imperfect protagonist.Its four-hour runtime really does allow it the space to make what might feel corny or melodramatic in a 90-minute film feel earned and heartbreaking in this one.Incredible performances all around. *Courtney* and I were glued to the screen the whole time.

**5. I Saw the TV Glow - 9/10** 

A movie I enjoyed thinking about as much—or more—than I enjoyed actually watching. Profound. Presents likely the best metaphor I’ve come across for existential dread and living through a life you’re not supposed to. Maybe transgenderism?(Later edit: I’ve since read that the director is trans and explicitly says that it is about the trans experience.)Very open to interpretation; stayed with me for weeks. Some really stunning visuals. Could have dull moments, but much more than the sum of its parts once it all comes together and likely the most important movie I will see this year.

**4. A Real Pain - 9.25/10** 

A fairly typical road-trip dramedy that feels very *Odd Couple meets Garden State* until about halfway through, at which point it becomes something new. In one of the more powerful single scenes I’ve watched, all of those genre tropes are suddenly shifted and subverted, and it becomes a uniquely vulnerable look into the psyche of the magnetic/difficult personality type.*A Real Pain* chooses to look at its characters with a seriousness and introspection that’s really uncommon. Maybe a little too much Chopin—got distracting.

**3. Red Rooms - 9.25/10** 

One of the most physically uncomfortable thrillers I’ve ever watched, with one of the all-time most disturbing single scenes—all the more noteworthy that it’s done without actual violence or gore depicted.An exploration of how dehumanizing and perverse true crime as a genre and hobby can get.

**2. It’s What’s Inside - 9.25/10** 

Has a distinct pop aesthetic that feels very “of today” and exciting. Incredibly stylish and fun.Kind of a low-brow concept on paper, but it’s taken as far—and in as many directions—as you could imagine it could be.Doesn’t take the easy, low-hanging fruit to engage your interest. On paper, the plot and premise are quite complicated, so it’s impressive just how easy it all is to follow in practice.

**1. Anora - 9.5/10** 

Might be a perfect movie. Begins beautiful and idyllic—like a music video suddenly becoming reality—and turns into something equal parts heart-wrenching and hilarious; a wildly entertaining deconstruction of a fairy tale.*Sean Baker’s* most traditionally staged film—definitely not shot on an iPhone this time—but still doesn’t lose the soul that his grittier pictures have.Great naturalistic dialog that allows the chemistry of the cast to take center stage. Love how *Baker* shines a light on people on the margins of society without judgment; he doesn’t glorify—this isn’t *Pretty Woman*—but he doesn’t cast stones.

dune2,dune 2,1j0m7s3,My review of ever Best Picture nomination,"Howdy all, I watched all of the Best Picture noms this year (more than some of the judges, lol), and I wanted to share my thoughts on them. 

**Preamble:** 

1.  I intentionally went into ever movie with an open mind, and ignored any external controversies. For example, I won't discredit The Brutalist for using AI, I won't discredit Emilia Pérez for Gascón's hateful tweets, and I won't discredit Dune 2 b/c I found Dune 1 mid

2. There's no intended order to my list. I might swap between good and bad to sandwich them, lol, but it's mostly vibes  

3. Any heavy spoilers will be spoiler tagged, but tread with caution. 

4. Please [be kind.](https://wp-media.patheos.com/blogs/sites/719/2022/07/Waymond-quote-scaled.jpg) People get passionate about their media takes, and that passion can come out as rudeness 


**I'm Still Here** - 8/10

- I found ""I'm Still Here"" to be incredibly moving. Of the ten, it was the only one to make me tear up

- It's interesting that it's based on a true story, and is covering a topic that most people outside of Brazil might not be familiar with. 

- It starts out incredibly strong, first establishing a happy loving family, then moving onto an incredibly tense and horrifying story when the parents are kidnapped by the government.

- It continues to be strong, covering the family growing and coping with the loss of their husband and father. But then it's that for the rest of the movie, which really starts to drag.

- I wish we got more of Eunice Paiva's life. She was an accomplished lawyer and activist, which was briefly touched upon, but the movie presents her as Mrs. >!My-Husband-is-Dead!< a bit too much


**Anora** - 3/10

- I found Anora to be boring and disinteresting. It's a bit shocking to me to see it get so much praise 

- The first 40 or so minutes are a waste of time. Very little happens until the goons show up 

- I get that it was trying to balance the goons being funny, and the danger of the situation Annie is in, but it just winds up failing at both. I legitimately got annoyed at the scenes where everyone is talking over one another 

- I get that it's about wealth inequality, but it doesn't say or do much with it. It's no Parasite, that's for sure  

**Conclave** - 8/10 

- Jumps right into the conflict, which is refreshing. Like, within the first 20 minutes we know that: the Pope is dead, they got to pick a new one, lot of people are contending for the position, there's some relevant documents in the bedroom 

- Holds my interest all the way through, even if who becomes the pope is a bit telegraphed. 

- I thought the reveal at the end that the pope is >!intersex!< was odd but interesting. Felt very biblical, and I was left wondering how people would react (not well, evidently, lol) 

**The Brutalist** - 5/10 

- Despite its length, it's well paced, so the time flew by. 

- It's well shot, and all of the visual choices were well done

- As a rags-to-riches story about a struggling Jewish immigrant, it's quite good and interesting. A bit too much telling and not enough showing

- It's all of the other stuff in the movie that weighs it down. It covers a lot, but I felt like it didn't say or do much with it. Religion, sexuality, drug abuse, all take up time, but I felt like they were lacking

- I didn't like >!the rape!< 

- I don't believe this was the intent, but it came off homophobic. It established a case of the [Not-Gays](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveIMentionedIAmHeterosexualToday) real quickly, which was later followed up by the only LGBT character being >!a rapist!<

**The Substance** - 8/10

- The Substance is very much a body horror movie, so if that's not your jam, it's hard to recommend. As a body horror movie though, it's one of the best

- It's fun, interesting, and colorful

- The message is blunt like a sledgehammer, but it's also a little vague. Like, it's clearly saying that Societal & Hollywood beauty standards can lead to mental decline and self destruction, but it's unclear how. Especially as the literal takes over the metaphorical towards the end of the movie 

**A Complete Unknown** - 6/10

- It's a competent musical biopic about Bob Dylan, which is nice given that we had two bad musical biopics in recent years: Maestro and Elvis

- The whole movie is a chill vibe, like a jam session 

- They made Bob Dylan not feel real, like he's a movie character in a world of real(er) people. Was he smoking and wearing sunglasses 24/7? lol

**Dune: Part Two** - 7/10

- Dune 2 was the first movie I saw of the ten, and the first time I watched it I found it kind of boring. But then time passed, and I forgot the boring bits, but remembered the cool parts. I recently rewatched it, and found it a much better experience. You need to pay attention for sure 

- This makes it hard to evaluate, lol. I gave it a 5/10 initially, b/c it def felt sleepy. There's a lot of punches you need to roll with, and it's easy to get confused and disinterested 

- Visually, it's a beautiful movie.

- There's a lot of cool and epic scifi elements. Simple stuff, like the levitation suits, to unique stuff, like the helicopter exploding inside its protective shield. 

- The action and fight scenes are praise worthy, and fun 

- Once you get a sense of the parties at play, there's some quality GoT level moves being played, although the emperor showing up towards the end was not justified enough 


**Nickel Boys** - 6/10

- The unique first person perspectives, time lapses, jumping through time, and artsy additions elevated an otherwise boring story

- It gets points for covering a part of America's history that goes forgotten 

- The artsy parts were a bit silly. Like towards the end >!a character dies, and then it shows a clip of them jumping behind a mirror, 'disappearing'!< 

- The twist was silly

**Wicked** - 9/10 

- Wicked was a lot of fun! 

- I wish more Best Picture noms were intentionally fun. Stuff like EEAAO and Poor Things really shine when compared to the serious and boring other contenders. 

- The humor, pacing, and plot really made the run time fly by 

- The songs are actually entertaining. Like, I found myself seeking them out after the fact. Specifically Popular and Defying Gravity 

- Lot of quality actors giving great performances, especially Ariana Grande stealing every scene she's in 

- There were some cringe elements. Like, they could have said the sister in the wheelchair was beautiful two or three less times, lol


**Emilia Pérez** - 1/10

- Emilia Pérez is unironically one of the worst movies I have ever seen. 

- There's an idea for a good movie within it, but it truly fails in ever aspect besides some nice visuals

- Just bizarre choice after bizarre choice from start to finish. It can be enjoyed in a ""so bad it's funny"" sense, like The Room

- The fact that it's nominated for a bunch of Oscars baffles me. If it wins any, it'll be another stain upon the Oscars imo",0,12,1740787301.0,2025-03-01 00:01:41,False
dune2,dune 2,1ixpff8,My Top Movies of 2024. Yours?,"1. Flow. Allegory in its finest form, innovative animation. The Kitty Abides. Best movie of the year.

4. The Wild Robot. Really great movie, just not quite as good as Flow.
5. The Brutalist. Awards favorite. Didn’t hit me like the previous 4, still great.
6. Wallace and Gromit. I’m a sucker for Aardman. Not as good as the previous shorts or movie, but still really good
7. Fall Guy. Fun, sometimes I just want a movie to be fun.

dune2,dune 2,1ixlyka,200 movies I have never seen (part 2).,"My goal this year is to watch 200 movies I have never seen before. As I go I am ranking them 1-10, and writing a few words on them. I'm not a movie critic, and my ratings are based on how much I enjoyed the film. Feel free to ask me anything, and give input and/or suggestions! I will be posting updates to this list of mine every 25 movies I watch from now on, although my first post was the first 27 movies I watched.

Below is the link to part 1 of my list:

https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/s/pen5lSSH6i

28. The silence of the lambs: 10/10.

29. Snakes on a plane: 5/10. Best movie about snakes on a plane i have ever seen.

30. Dune (1984): 5/10. I was lost the whole time, but something (sorta) clicked at the end. Some cool and funny effects.

31. The zone of interest: 7/10. Horrifying and unique.

32. Scream: 5/10. This movie just kept getting dumber and dumber as it went on.

33. Gangs of new york: 7/10. I almost quit 15 minutes in, and it was pretty long. Daniel day-lewis was excellent.

34. Black swan: 10/10.

35. House: 5/10. Loved the ridiculous effects, but thats all it had going for it.

36. Space is the place: 3/10. I love Sun Ra and his music. I really wanted to like this movie but i just couldn't.

37. Final destination: 1/10. Not a single enjoyable moment in this whole movie. it actually put me in a bad mood.

38. The florida project: 8/10. Reminded me of living in florida when i was a kid. felt a little longer than it was.

39. Blue velvet: 7/10. Cant think of what to write here, other than this movie felt like a bad dream,.

40. Taxi driver: 10/10.

41. The fellowship of the ring: 7/10. Weak first hour or so. I've never been crazy about fantasy, but i like how easy this was to follow so far.

42. The two towers: 6/10. It couldn't hold my attention the way the 1st movie did.

42. Return of the king: 6/10. Long. Wasnt crazy about the ending. They should have just waited another 20 years to make these movies.

43. Asteroid city: 7/10. Wes Anderson.

44. House of 1000 corpses: 2/10. Nearly every important character and performance was downright annoying.

45. Hereditary: 8/10. This is my favorite kind of horror movie. 

46. Goldeneye: 7/10. My expectations were low, but i was surprised at how good this was. Better than the 2 dalton movies.

47. Tomorrow never dies: 7/10. Some great action sequences, and a pretty cool villain.

48. The world is not enough: 4/10. Boring. Top 3 worst bond movie (that i have seen, obviously).

49. Die another day: 6/10. Some really awful special effects. But i liked the ridiculous ending, and the villain.

50. Nosferatu (1922): 6/10. Visually satisfying, and a good score. orlock is freaky looking.",0,7,1740455665.0,2025-02-25 03:54:25,False

dune2,dune 2,1ir275p,BAFTAS 2025 - Glad to see Warwick Davies getting acknowledged with a BAFTA Fellowship,"...Which has given him and his achievements more time on screen. The Beeb gave a lot of time to his award. He seems like a lovely person who's contributed massively to movies and the world in general.

And his acting is underrated. For example, he played two roles in Harry Potter, not one, and although he was good as Flitwick, that was probably easy; he was actually creepily evil as Griphook through his acting alone. 

Otherwise, the biggest shock of the evening was seeing Take That introduced as British music royalty. Dune 2 getting best film (I think?) They're sweeping through the awards so quickly I'll have to look them up!

dune2,dune 2,1imn4rj,What are some movies worth getting on Blu Ray?,"My brother just informed me how cheap Blu rays are now, something I already kind of knew but didn't think about purchasing til right now. I checked Amazon and sure enough Dune 2 was only $8.25 CAN, which is insane to me, I guess streaming really is killing physical medium.

Anyway, it got me thinking, some movies are definitely worth owning on Blu Ray, not necessarily just your favourite movies, but some visually striking ones like Lawrence of Arabia, or Interstellar.

Or as Gurney, basically the Army chief of staff for House Atreidies and he's chilling in the barracks with his men sharing exploits.

I think Josh loves wearing the hat of the passionate loyalist and I love how it comes off as his best quality in each character that he plays for Dennis.  I think it started growing on me when I was watching Dune 1 and Sicario Day of the Soldado. So when they announced Dune 2, I just had to go back to Sicario to try and understand why Dennis puts him in those roles.

And as i watched and rewatched i kept on thinking, yeah you could find some other grizzled aging guy to play the character, but who else but Brolin can keep it that simple and still have lots to reveal about himself later on. Cause who else but Mat Graver could take the fall in a do or die situation when no one else has the balls to. I feel like he keeps the story honest even if he has to go his own way to make it happen..",0,1,1739173027.0,2025-02-10 07:37:07,False

dune2,dune 2,1ibmpun,What Films from 2024 Will People Actually Remember in 30 years?,"With Oscars nominations recently announced, we're talking about 2024 movies quite a lot, and it might seem like they will all be as equally ""popular"" for the rest of time. But that can't be true. There are certain movies that endure, that remain in the zeitgeist, that become culturally significant, after successive generations. Others, for better or worse, fade to obscurity over time, at least among the general population.

So. What movies from 2024 will we still be talking about in 30+ years?

My picks:

* Dune: Part 2 - This may very well go down as one of the greatest Sci-Fi movies of all time, especially if Messiah does well and Denis' career continues on its current trajectory.
* Wicked: I wasn't a huge fan, but the Broadway play has obviously endured and I suspect the movie (and its eventual sequel) will inspire new fans. People, including kids, will be singing these songs for a while, I think.
* The Substance: It will go down as one the most shocking, gruesome, and intense (body) horror films of the last 20 years, maybe the 21st century? It will never be *hugely* popular, but it will be one that is always on the minds of movie fans and one that regular people say ""Oh yeah I've heard of The Substance. Wasn't it super fucked up?"" a-la The Thing and The Fly.
* The Brutalist: I'm not sure about this one, as it's unfortunately not more popular. But I think in some circles it may go down as one of the best, grandest, most poignant American epics ever made. Not quite The Godfather or Lawrence of Arabia, but maybe close?
* The Wild Robot: Another one that I wasn't a huge fan of, but another one that was well-liked and appealed to both adults and children. I could see this being the kind of movie people are excited to show their kids one day.
* Challengers: Despite not getting any(!) Oscar nominations, certain people really, really loved this one. It's got a bit of everything and I think is pretty rewatchable, so I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes the kind of movie that people put on when they don't know what else to watch.
* You could maybe throw Inside Out 2 and Flow in here too (appealing to both kids and adults), but I think The Wild Robot is the more likely to be loved by many for years to come.

I'd wager most other films from this year will be regarded as good to great, but will probably not *endure*. They'll be the kind of movies that if you haven't seen it, you haven't heard of it.

dune2,dune 2,1i2gkh3,Is it me or was 2024 an incredible year for movies?,"Dune Part 2 absolutely floored me when I saw it in imax. Went back 3 more times. Wicked made me (31M) sob in absolute awe at the end. A Complete Unknown was an incredible feat of a biopic. I’ve never left the theater feeling this much about movies until these 3 all in the same year. 

Maybe I’m just loving movies more and more. ",0,17,1737000510.0,2025-01-16 04:08:30,False

dune2,dune 2,1hzi0sw,Has anybody very strongly emotionally connected with Denis Villeneuve's Dune?,"Dune Part 2 seems to be a shoe in for many people's best movie of 2024, and I half understand why. The craftsmanship in every category is immaculate, it's a precisely put together yet beautiful spectacle. But I have never seen or heard a single person describe how these two movies have impacted them personally.

I'm not doubting the movie is capable of doing so for certain people, the themes and characters seem juicy for emotional resonance, and that's why it seems like a weird omission from the conversation. So if you adore these movies, I ask how have they made you feel seen or changed by them?",0,30,1736669109.0,2025-01-12 08:05:09,False
dune2,dune 2,1hy7q3t,"Why does Avatar get more ""hate"" than Phase 1-3 MCU and the Original Star Wars Trilogy?","I feel like the Avatar franchise as a blockbuster gets more hate than its fellow blockbuster ""rivals"", in regards to its quality, when at the end of the day, it's not like the others are thought provoking pieces of media either, so i don't understand why Avatar is deemed as the intelectually inferior one of the three, while the other two are seen as more serious.

Avatar gets criticized for having a simple plot and for ""copying"" Pocahontas, Fern Gully and Dance with Wolves, but then the first 3 phases of MCU regurgigate the same hero's journey over and over again with the hero facing off with the similarly-powered villain or how the original Star Wars trilogy ""copies"" Dune and Hidden Fortress.

Also, is Avatar silly? I think it would be fair to say yes, but i mean, the Phase 1-3 MCU and Star Wars aren't?

Maybe (most likely) this is just a reddit echo chamber thing, and i don't want to bring politics into this, but i feel like there is a certain comparison to be made in regards to how english-speaking subreddits tend to live in a bubble/echo chamber and then get surprised by the reality of the world akin to USA Elections of 2024.

Europe and Asia also seem to have a much better reception towards Avatar and i guess you could say ""it's their **Star Wars**"", but even then it's clearly popular in America, other wise it wouldn't be as successful as it was.

So i think that the reason for this ""hatred"" is due to nostalgia and nerd fanbases not liking the fact that a single movie managed to reach the top 1 of box office without countless of other movies, easter eggs, comic books and decades of ""cultural impact"" rewatchability, so they try to demean Avatar as a franchise as just ""Dances with Wolves/Fern Gully and Pocantonas in Space with no cultural impact, when at the end of the day, most people don't even know what those 3 movies are in the first place.

Which reminds me of that Invicible quote, ""Look what they need to even mimic a fraction of our power"", when at the end of the day Avatar doesn't have decades of known content and fandoms (such as MCU through Marvel Comics or Star Wars with 2 trilogies and countless anaimated shows), but it still managed to make a name for itself without any ""crutches"".

Also, Avatar is too earnest and sincere about its themes, plot and characters, which tends to not be too well received in cynical social platforms and forums such as reddit and truth be told, the Avatar fandom (yes, it exists lmao) doesn't seem to be as toxic as the fandoms from the other two.

**Too Long Didn't Read**: Avatar isn't high-art but it gets too much undeserved hate compared to other popular blockbuster IPs (that are not high-art either), when most of its criticism (plot wise) can easily be applied to the Phase 1-3 MCU and the original Star Wars trilogy but they aren't because of nostalgia and double standards.",0,90,1736525012.0,2025-01-10 16:03:32,False

dune2,dune 2,1hwvbpc,The hysteria around Dune 2 getting snubbed is annoying,"I liked the film, quite a lot. That's the pre-requisite. I liked it more than the first film but anyone thinking it would get the same award season love is delusional. This isn't Lord of the Rings, the stans have just managed to trick everyone that it is. This isn't a once in a generation production landmark that was a consolation for three years back to back filming that redefined fantasy and blockbuster filmmaking. It's just a very good, very well made contemporary blockbuster. The first film only got in I think because they wanted a big popular movie to boost ratings to be honest, but they're too snobbish to have gone for Spider-Man.

I know Film Twitter, Film Reddit etc want to think that non-superhero blockbusters are somehow superior, but in the eyes of the awards bodies, they're the same. They won't acknowledge sci-fi, or horror, or genre filmmaking as seriously, ever. It's a pointless thing to argue about. Everything Everywhere was like Parasite - too big and dominating in the year to ignore. And Cameron will probably beat up anyone who doesn't nominate Avatar films. They're the exception. The only reason Wicked is getting in is the same reason the first Dune got in - they want a big popular film, but are too snobbish against superhero films to ever nominate one. People were confused as to the lack of The Batman nominations as well - it's a superhero film, they'll \*never be good enough\*, Marvel logo or not.

It's a great film, made loads of money, what's there to lose sleep over? Horror's had a great showing this year but still barely anything, I still like the films.",0,18,1736371314.0,2025-01-08 21:21:54,False
dune2,dune 2,1hvnuw4,My ranking of 2024! ,"I’m going by U.K. release dates, it’s just easier for me and it means I don’t spend the first two months of the year adding movies to my previous year’s lists 

1. The Zone of Interest – One of the most powerful movies I’ve ever seen. Such a simple concept, but so impactful, putting you directly into the shoes of evil in a way that leaves you so unsettled even as the end credits roll. And obviously the sound design is absolutely fantastic, but the visuals and filming style also leave a massive impact. 
2. Challengers – So well structured and tightly plotted, the relationship development and the drama was so good and the end was especially unforgettable. 

3. The Wild Robot – Such a beautiful story of love and nature and community and found family, with absolutely stunning animation. 
4. Conclave – From the stunning cinematography and the colours to the political machinations of the conclave itself, everything about this movie is so tightly done. Explores so much and it never feels like a theme or plot line is under explored or skipped over. The politics unfolds perfectly and it leaves you with so many ideas to think about. And, although everyone in the movie is great, Ralph Fiennes especially has to get best lead actor for this! 
5. All Of Us Strangers – A powerful story about grief and loneliness which lingers long after the end credits and Paul Mescal and Andrew Scott are both wonderful in it. 
6. Wicked – One of my all time favourite musicals and the incredibly long wait was so worth it! An adaptation that retained everything great about the original show, with a stellar cast, brilliant choreography and just enough expansion to round out the plot for the big screen. 
7. His Three Daughters – A deeply emotional and heartfelt portrayal of grief and family, with highly affecting performances from the three leads, and very cleverly directed. 
8. Daughters – An incredibly moving and powerful must watch documentary, about an incredible program, which allows incarcerated fathers to have a father daughter dance with their daughters. It’s also immaculately directed by Angela Patton and Natalie  Rae and they do such a good job at weaving so many stories together, while simultaneously deftly exploring the deeper issues at play within the US prison system. 
9. Lisa Frankenstein – Totally weird and unique in the best way possible, very darkly funny, great set design and costuming and a very fun plot overall. Feels like a Heathers-esque future cult classic. 
10. Wicked Little Letters – fantastic writing and dialogue, really funny, brilliant performances and I loved that it was a true story 
11. One Life – A beautiful true story and it made me cry. 
12. The End We Start From – A story of hope, resilience and survival in hard times, with a great lead performance from Jodi Comer. 
13. American Fiction – a very funny, biting and incredibly well written satire, which effortlessly explores many complex themes, whilst also functioning very effectively as a comedy at the same time. 
14. My Old Ass – A really funny and surprisingly emotional examination 
15. The Outrun – A wonderful performance from Saiorse Ronan, a story about addiction, crashing and rising back up and I loved how cyclical, dreamy and hazy the whole thing felt. The cinematography and locations also stunning. 
16. Seize Them — Absolutely hilarious, very well written and a 10/10 cast. 
17. The Bikeriders – An epic and well told deconstruction of biker culture, which maintains multiple stories at once and does all of them justice, while also telling a very interesting and tragic true story
18. Wallace and Gromit: Vengance Most Fowl – A wonderful comeback for one of the best animated franchises of all time. Witty, so many funny details, a great commentary on AI and it was just lovely to have Wallace and Gromit back on Christmas Day. 
19. Better Man – A bold, original, creative and very emotionally compelling biopic with a great soundtrack 
20. Snack Shack – A warm, witty, nostalgic, summery and overall very  funny portrayal of teenage life
21. The Fall Guy – A great surprise and a fantastic tribute to stunt people. Very funny, meta, emotionally impactful and it had a great love story. 
22. Woman of The Hour – this manages to be a fantastic portrayal of a real life story, an exploration of the dangers women face even today and a really tightly made thriller. A fantastic directorial debut for Anna Kendrick, who also does a great job in the lead role. 
23. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice – One of my biggest pleasant surprises of the year. So fun and funny! Just a great, creative, madcap adventure. And I loved the use of practical effects. 
24. Dune Part 2 – Epic, incredible cinematography, great performances and much more tightly plotted than the first film. 
25. We Live In Time – Warm, funny and heartbreaking at the same time. And I loved seeing Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh together. 
26. The Color Purple – A big, bright, colourful, unapologetic musical, with a classic empowering and beautiful story of a woman who goes through so much and finds her identity with the support of other women. 
27. Kneecap – As funny as it is dynamically filmed, it also has some great deeper messages at play. 
28. The Holdovers – Another cozy and funny Christmas movie, with a strong emotional core and great character development. 
29. That Christmas – A very heartwarming, funny and cozy Christmas film. 
30. Monkey Man – A well paced, well directed and emotional action thriller.  
31. Blitz – A great snapshot of a fascinating moment in history, with great cinematography and a really epic feel overall. I also really enjoyed the way that George was able to explore and examine his identity as a mixed race child in England at this time. Although the blitz is so covered as a historical period, this really did feel like a fresh perspective. 
32. The Piano Lesson – a classic play, well built tension and a stellar cast. 
33. Gladiator 2 – Not a massively strong plot, but epic, stunningly shot and highly enjoyable overall. 
34. Joy – A heartwarming portrayal of an important story and a lovely tribute to its characters. 
35. Jim Henson: Idea Man – A loving, informative and creatively made tribute to an incredible man with an incredible life. 
36. Young Woman and the Sea – A very interesting biopic with some stunning cinematography. 
37. Love Lies Bleeding – A really tense and well made crime thriller, with good performances and an interesting critique on toxic and abusive relationships.
38. Civil War – A really pleasant surprise and not what I expected at all. A biting and fascinating exploration of the ethics of war reporting and photojournalism. The only reason it’s not much higher is that (and I do understand what they were trying to do with it tbf), I felt the vagueness of the conflict with clues hidden here and there distracted a bit from what the film was trying to say and explore overall. 
39. Anora – Overall, Anora is a fascinating, funny and moving character and trope de-construction. The only reason it’s not much higher on my list is that the middle drags a bit and the dialogue is pretty repetitive at times. 
40. Fancy Dance – A moving film with an especially good performance from Lily Gladstone, exploring issues faced by indigenous families to great emotional impact. But I did think it ended a bit abruptly without much resolution. 
41. The Critic – An intriguing murder mystery with lots of twists and turns, as well as great performances, especially from Ian Mckellen. 
42. Paddington in Peru – Not as good as the first two Paddington films, but still a fun and funny adventure that’s well worth a watch. 
43. Moana 2 – stunning animation and an enjoyable plot. The only three things that drag it down a bit for me: the music isn’t nearly as good as the first one and the fact that you can hear that it’s an attempt to mimic LMM’s music from the first movie made it worse. The villains were pretty weak. And without spoiling it too much I wasn’t a big fan of certain things that happen to Moana at the end. 
44. Lee – A really interesting insight into someone with an extraordinary life. Kate Winslet and Andy Samberg were great in it too. 
45. Carry On – A tense and enjoyable thriller that builds up its plot well. Not a masterpiece, but a really fun afternoons’ watch. 
46. Bad Tidings – A great Christmas comedy with two of my favourite comedians.
47. Rob Peace – A lovely tribute to someone with a tragic life.
48. Deadpool and Wolverine – funny with a very clever meta narrative and a great use of music. I didn’t like the first Deadpool that much and I skipped the second one, but this is absolutely the strongest of the trilogy.
49. Bob Marley: One Love – A really interesting insight into an icon. 
50. Inside Out 2 – As funny, clever and emotionally effective as the last film. But it just gave me everything I liked about the first film and didn’t really push the boundaries of the Inside Out world in the way that it could have and that I hoped it would. 
51. Suncoast – An emotionally affecting film with great performances. Nico Parker is especially great, but Woody Harrelson’s character feels a bit pointless and the mum is pretty terrible. 
52. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire – A fun and funny addition to an iconic for a reason franchise. 
53. Turtles All The Way Down – A cute teen film with an especially effective portrayal of the mental health side of the story. But some of the subplots did feel a bit bizarre and unecessary with not so great execution. 
54. Mother’s Instinct – a fairly standard slightly soapy thriller with good performances that builds tension well. 
55. Shirley – An interesting story, but not told in an overly exciting way. 
56. Fly Me To The Moon – A sweet and entertaining love story that just dragged a bit too much towards the end for me. 
57. Mean Girls – I had fun with this especially as a musical theatre fan. The music from the Broadway show is good, it was funny and the performances were enjoyable. But it was a bit dragged down by some of the adaptation choices, mainly in the music. It felt like they were ashamed that it was a musical and that they kept trying to de-Broadway the songs to make it “cool”, which I didn’t feel was necessary. 
58. Spaceman – An interesting and surprisingly emotional concept, even if it was a bit strange. 
59. Kinds Of Kindness – great cast and interesting thematic links between the three stories, but I felt it went on a bit too long in the end. 
60. Find Me Falling – just a bland Netflix romance. Not the worst thing I’ve ever seen but not great either. 
61. Damsel – although it was very generic girl power and wasn’t the best quality overall, the action was entertaining and I did find the plot engaging. 
62. The Garfield Movie – This was cute and fairly entertaining for what it was, but didn’t go beyond that for me. 
63. Drive Away Dolls – This had some potential as a witty crime caper, but the plot felt thin, rushed and underdeveloped for me. 
64. The Hit Man – I get that the characters being terrible was kind of the point, but I didn’t find them or the film as a whole very engaging. 
65. A Different Man – I felt like this had so much potential in the beginning, but once the post change stuff started I didn’t really understand what it was trying to say, other than saying that the struggles we saw throughout the entire first half was just because of his attitude, which is a terrible message if that was the intention. 
66. Back To Black – the actress playing Amy Winehouse did a decent job, but it focused way too much on her personal life and not nearly enough on her music and felt like it didn’t do her justice overall. 
67. Emilia Pérez – A not too bad idea executed in the most bizarre and jarring way possible. 
68. The Persian Version – I was excited for this one from the trailer, but it felt like the director wanted to tell so many different stories and couldn’t effectively concentrate on any of them. 
69. A Family Affair – Started off kind of funny at the very beginning with Zack Efron playing a big headed movie star, but the plot got very strange and terrible very quickly. 
70. Despicable Me 4 – As someone who honestly loved the first Despicable Me, it’s been so sad to see all the heart slowly sapped out of the franchise, with this nothing of a film being the end result. It’s funny in some places, but there’s so little plot, heart and character development that it’s honestly depressing. All the characters and situations are just a vehicle for comedy, with nothing else added in, leaving the whole thing feeling empty overall. ",2,12,1736242517.0,2025-01-07 09:35:17,False

**\~\~TOP TEN\~\~**

**1 - Challengers (2024) - 4.5/5**

Challengers is electric and kinetic and ridiculous and thumping and smashing and mean and confident. Are we still talking about tennis?

There are moments it almost starts taking itself too seriously, then some clever camera work or the fantastic Reznor/Ross score or an absurd amount of trash blowing around in a storm releases the dramatic tension enough for the pulsating style and sensuality to remain the driving heartbeat of the film.

**2 - The Substance (2024) - 4.5/5**

An excellent satirical film looking at the strained relationship between bodies and beauty. At a certain point, this movie goes insane, and it works. If you have the chance to watch with a group, do it.

**3 - Small Things Like These (2024) - 4.5/5**

A quiet, unadorned movie about empathy and strength in the face of heartless, institutional, patriarchal oppression, with an interesting and important subversion of typical portrayal of gender roles within. Indeed, this film is more important than it seems to want to be.

**4 - Dune: Part Two (2024) - 4.5/5**

Remarkable achievement to maintain an epic interplanetary scope along with a personal struggle to own one's destiny amid strong political, cultural, and familial influences. Awesome visuals and sounds, winning performances, and an unsettling moral through line that invokes deep questions without easy answers.

**5 - Exhuma (2024) - 4.5/5**

Brilliantly taps the difficulty and danger of struggling against strongholds in places deep and old, and truths that must be exhumed and rectified if there is to be any healing.

**6 - The Wild Robot (2024) - 4.5/5**

Gorgeous, fresh, funny, sweet, and a little daring. It's hard not to invoke Pixar for comparison, and with all due respect to Inside Out, The Wild Robot is a reminder of what Pixar used to be capable of.

**7 - Chime (2024) - 4.5/5**

A worthy spiritual successor to Kurosawa's Cure, Chime is an unnerving short film with unexplained acts of casual violence and a slipping grasp of what it means to be a human in the modern world. The alienation of characters from their work, their passions, and those around them, along with the rising sense that not everything we see is what we think, gives the film a feeling of an off-kilter piece of cursed media.

Kurosawa is excellent behind the camera, and is matched by the wonderful cinematography and sound design.

**8 - The Apprentice (2024) - 4.5/5**

It takes its time, but once this movie reveals itself, it's absolutely captivating. Full of terrific, evolving performances. Looks right and sounds right. At the heart of the film is a terrifying idea: maybe these dark sociopaths know what America really is, and the rest of us are just deluded idealists.

**9 - Love Lies Bleeding (2024) - 4/5**

Immediate and tactile, immersive and intense. The weight of the film grows as the lives of the main characters intertwine. A complementary marriage of surrealism and authenticity. Excellent performances. Looks and sounds fantastic.

**10 - Nosferatu (2024) - 4/5**

Mostly faithful, with meaningful minor tweaks. Impossible not to compare to Eggars earlier films. Nosferatu is more arresting but not as haunting as The VVitch, and more approachable but less bold than The Lighthouse. May be the sweet spot for many. Unfortunately the projector at the theater for my viewing was not bright enough to do the visuals justice. Seek out a screen that is up to the challenge.

**\~\~BOTTOM TEN\~\~**

**56 - Snack Shack (2024) - 2.5/5**

This movie almost works because of the chemistry and energy of the three central actors, despite the grating nature of much of their dialog. In the end it’s too long, has too many contrived dramatic moments, and fails to evoke nostalgia either for any certain time or age.

**57 - Terrifier 3 (2024) - 2.5/5**

Not scary or disturbing, sometimes comical, occasionally boring. I wish I was having as much fun as everyone else with these movies, but they just aren't a fit for me. There are some gross scenes, but not in a evocative way, just mildly playful gore.

**58 - Godzilla × Kong: The New Empire (2024) - 2.5/5**

There's something great about the audacity of putting a giant transformer-looking gauntlet on Kong's arm. Too much pseudo-spiritual weirdness in a bizarre attempt to add lore where it's not needed. Nothing makes any sense, but I guess the gung-ho attitude is appreciated.

**59 - Emilia Pérez (2024) - 2.5/5**

There is a lot to admire, but the film wobbles and waffles on what it’s really about until it ends up reducing itself into something shallow.

**60 - Brothers (2024) - 2.5/5**

A bad movie in which good actors can't find their characters but still somehow manage to keep things just watchable enough to get the audience through it.

**61 - Salem's Lot (2024) - 2/5**

The things the film does well are completely overshadowed by clunky writing, acting, and editing.

**62 - Azrael (2024) - 2/5**

A little too opaque without payoff. It's choices in storytelling make it withholding, likely with the intent of keeping it simple. Instead it ends up tedious and uninteresting. Even the monsters seem bored.

**63 - Wolfs (2024) - 2/5**

There might be a movie somewhere in this Clooney and Pitt bromance, but one would need a high tolerance for their flirty banter to bother sifting it out.

**64 - MadS (2024) - 1/5**

Obviously a lot of careful planning and teamwork goes into making a one shot film, but the end product here is excruciating to watch, and not in a good way. It’s tempting to nitpick some of the style and story choices, but those aren’t what makes this movie an unbearable wreck of unlikeable characters screaming and running away from nowhere in particular to nowhere in particular. The visuals are constantly ugly, and the sounds are often grating.

**65 - IF (2024) - 0.5/5**

A cynical and heartless commercial product parading around as a heartwarming tall-tale family movie. John Krasinski and Ryan Reynolds need to do some self-reflection. This is the opposite of art and deserves contempt.

  
And of course, there's still a bunch of 2024 releases that I look forward to watching in the future. Happy to hear any recs for features I missed.",3,55,1736042288.0,2025-01-05 01:58:08,False
dune2,dune 2,1httt1f,Rate my 10 favorites. ,"I'm 15 and I haven't really seen a whole bunch, but here's the list! 

10. Zodiac (2007). I love David Fincher so very much. His movies' atmospheres are unmatched. I think this is his greatest achievement, but this isn't the last time he'll come up on this list. 

9. La La Land (2016). Damien Chazelle might be my favorite working filmmaker, and you can see his talent on full display in this film. I'm a sucker for musically themed films (I play in a youth symphony), and this one just hits so hard for me every time. 

8. The Godfather (1972). Probably the most obvious favorite of all time, but I legit love it so much. Maybe the most ""perfect"" movie I've seen, there is just nothing wrong with it. 

7. Rear Window (1954). Alfred Hitchcock is my guy. The suspence and tension in this thing is unmatched. It's also so minimalistically immersive; it doesn't require huge spectacle or wide shots to make you feel like you're part of the movie, watching the events unfold with the characters. 

6. Dune: Part Two (2024). Could be recency bias, but I've also seen this eight times, so I don't know lol. This just looks and sounds incredible, with amazing world building and acting. Might be the best experience I've had in a movie theater. 

5. Whiplash (2014). J.K Simmons in this movie low-key might be my favorite performance in a movie ever. This might be the most visceral reaction I've had to a movie; I was so tense throughout. Fletcher is one of the most terrifying villains for me personally because, as I said above, music is a huge part of my life. 

4. There Will Be Blood (2007). When I said Simmons in Whiplash might be my favorite performance, it's against DDL in this movie. This is a great portrait of the rise and fall of a powerful figure. I love period pieces, and this is the ultimate period piece in my mind. 

3. Se7en (1995). What I said about Zodiac applies here as well. The atmosphere in this thing is just incredibly immersive, and it has one of the best plot twists ever obviously.

2. Inception (2010). Say what you will about Christopher Nolan, but I love this guy. This is probably one of his better-written films, and has his most interesting concept. Also, the hallway fight scene might be in my top 5 movie scenes. 

1. Parasite (2019). This is maybe the only movie I could watch every day and not get tired of it. My favorite screenplay for sure. Writing this makes me want to watch it again right now.

Anyway, I obviously think all these films are amazing, but what do you think of these picks? ",0,32,1736039565.0,2025-01-05 01:12:45,False
dune2,dune 2,1hssbxd,Looking Back On 2024 (A Cinematic Year in Review),"As a preface, I will only list here what I watched during the past year, which includes the delayees (is that even a word) from 2023, movies moved to 2024 due to the idiotic distribution structure of my country. These include The Iron Claw, The Holdovers, Poor Things, May December, The Zone of Interest, The Boy and the Heron, Priscilla and the Anatomy of a Fall. Some others I didn’t get around to watch or haven’t heard of before 2024, like Sisu, Kiss The Girls or Mr. Holmes. With that out of the way, let’s get down to it!

34. Rebel Moon: A Child of Fire. No surprise here, but I still think it’s a half-decent movie. I mean, of course, most of the plot is claptrap (despite a couple good in-isolation scenes), the lore is established way too haphazardly for its own good and the cinematography doesn’t provide as much gravitas or atmosphere to the scenes as it thinks it is, but Snyder still manages to squeeze out some nice performances (in particular from Michiel Huisman and the delightfully malicious Ed Skrein as Admiral Atticus Noble). And the score by Junkie XL unironically SLAPS. It’s weighty, ethereal and immersive as fuck, especially everytime chorals and angry artificial howling - Noble’s theme - can be heard on the screen. It is ultimately due to the music that the movie is not a failure.

33. Godzilla X Kong: A New Empire. This one’s merit, on the other hand, lies exclusively in the visual spectacle. Here Holkenborg could not cook up something noteworthy, but the action carried hard. I mean, mostly because the Skar King and Shimo’s battle against G and K wore off pretty quickly. The human characters were uncompelling, the story presented no interesting themes, and the visuals I found pretty below average. It was just mediocre.

32. Rebel Moon: The Scargiver. A slight bump as far as overall cinematic quality is concerned. The cinematography offers something more visually enthralling, and this time Snyder’s time wasting pays off in a way. Holkenborg keeps the score quality intact, as is the case with Skrein’s performance. But the movie is still a haphazardly conceived mess of poorly constructed, bizarrely acting individuals I’ve little to no connection to. So, a miss.

31. Ferrari. I don’t have a whole lot to say about it, other than the faux-Italian accents were a definite miss, and everything aside from the racing scenes and Penelope Cruz’s performance was just uninteresting. But Cruz and the races carried hard, plain and simple. Still, a mediocre movie that fails to examine its protagonist.

30. Mr. Holmes. It was an overall interesting take on an older Holmes, with Ian McKellen turning in a memorable performance as both versions of the character. To me the film did a good job juggling three separate plotlines, all of which had some merit. All in all, a graceful portrayal of an aged hero that lost most things and people he cared about. For some it’ll certainly be more graceful than the fates of Indiana Jones, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.

29. The Boy and the Heron. Compared to how praised it was… I was disappointed. Maybe it was just me getting to know Miyazaki for the first time for real. But interestingly enough, I found very little interesting content in the movie other than the animation itself and the Grey Heron. I sure felt for Mahito, but I didn’t get to know him a whole lot in a substantial way. Nor any other character, really. They were like silhouettes, just passing through the screen, mere figures pushing Mahito to the next plot point. And his grand-grand-grand uncle? A complete afterthought. I don’t even know why he created that fantastical world, and a minute of WW2 carnage coupled with a few throwaway lines about the world’s “wickedness” a theme make not, sadly. But it’s still a good movie.

28. The Beekeeper. I had a good time, despite a plot light on thematics and character, but loaded with an absurd amount of bee metaphors. Adam, Jason Statham’s character, was reasonably grounded with both ruthlessness for capitalist scammers and care for ordinary citizens. Add some nice visuals, twists and supporting performances and you got a good, if overall run-of-the-mill action flick.

27. Scent of a Woman. Yeah, I like it. Most of it boils down to a fucking tour de force performance by Al Pacino and character work related to his character, but he just makes it work, especially with the “I’ll show you OUT OF ORDER!” scene. I won’t elaborate any further.

26. Insurrectionist 1863. For the first time we venture into Poland to see a historical movie telling the story of Father Stanisław Brzóska’s involvement in the January Uprising of 1863. The priest himself aside, the characters weren’t too compelling, but Brzóska’s journey throughout the movie, especially his role as a priest evolving in the conflict, makes it all worth it. This is a piece of cinema hard carried by the protagonist.

25. Screw Mickiewicz. Once more a Polish film which will (most likely) only hit for you if you’re from the country like myself. But it was a genuinely hilarious and lively flick, with a lot of actual understanding of the teenage Poles’ mentality and some fairly emotional moments. Also, a really nice soundtrack assembled from the works of modern Polish rap and pop artists.

24. The Iron Claw. Another overrated - if nearly actually great - darling of 2023. Like with Miyazaki’s piece, I felt little emotional connection to the Von Erich brothers, the most belonging to David - who died first. The amount of bad shit happening in succession was also too much; it felt like, dare I say, misery porn at times. No interesting cinematography (save for the black ‘n’ white opening) or music either. But the movie did present a compelling story looking at the plot elements themselves, and Fritz Von Erich was a very well-realized character.

23. May December. The first proper great movie of the bunch. Maybe some more time should have been spent on dissecting the relationship between Melton’s Joe and Moore’s Gracie, but since the protagonist is a sensationalist, self-important bitch that doesn’t care about the people she’ll be portraying, that’s what we get. Speaking of which, Natalie Portman made the movie for me, it was like a female Kirk Lazarus performance, absolutely stunning. Technical side of things wise it didn’t wow me, but its examination of the subject matter is absolutely commendable.

22. Sisu. Holy crap, what a great action flick. A bunch of decently despicable Nazis against an endlessly adaptable Finnish vet/hermit. Some nice team work between him and the enslaved women in the end, enthralling action and the pure grit make for a great offering. Again, see it in case you have not!

21. Alien: Romulus. I never hated Covenant (I just thought the ending with le bad guy David winning was stupid, which was understandable given the fact I was 14 back then and didn’t truly recognize the merit of bleaker closures in cinema), so I didn’t expect Romulus to be a “return to form”, but its upholding, which it was. Cailee Spaeny once again smashed the hell out of her role, nailing her more relaxed and tense scenes a like. She is also able to just… appear and act genuinely likeable, she makes for a rootable protagonist, y’know? Another standout is David Jonsson, playing an android like he was Paul Bettany or goddamn Michael Fassbender himself. Ian Holm’s undead appearance is irksome, sure, but they managed to disguise it well enough for me not to detect it until after I delved into the discourse. The horror of the aliens? On point. Atmosphere? Impeccable. Visuals? Breathtaking.

20. Rebel Ridge. This one is a milder offering spectacle and politics wise compared to the ones that come after it in the list, but it’s a worthy watch. The opener alone is a powerful one, and while perhaps not entirely accurate to how these things would go down, it gave me a good idea of the possible ways American cops abuse their authority, especially in regards to black people. And it’s consistently great throughout, especially with its execution of the non-killing protagonist.

19. Kiss The Girls. It’s an older one, but it checks out. I especially appreciate the sheer terror of the Casanova, both pre and post-reveal. Morgan Freeman, Cary Elwes and Ashley Judd all crushed their roles. But this won’t do the movie any justice… If you haven’t seen it for yourself, do it.

18. Furiosa. As far as prequels go, this one’s neat. Important info regarding the Mad Max world is there, coupled with brilliant performances by Anya Taylor-Joy (how the hell did she manage to emulate Charlize this well?! HOW?!) and Chris Hemsworth, who, channeling his inner Thor, puts a MadMaxesque spin on it, adding a layer of post-apocalyptic internal hollowness and insatiable, self-fueling cruelty and hatred, bred by some terrible trauma, not unlike Furiosa’s (or Thor’s, for that matter). I suppose that’s the main merit of the movie, the ways in which they mirror each other. Which makes their final scene together a fucking standout. Also, pay attention to the History Man: George Shevtsov is fantastic in the role, and occasionally he drops Thanos-level banger lines, adding both philosophical ideas and vulnerability to the story.

17. Joker: Folie à Deux. Likely the most controversial take, but I love this movie. It takes the well-known story from 2019, puts it in a new setting and makes the most of it. I was especially stoked once I realized the musical inserts were fantasies, extensions of Arthur and Harley’s desires, fears and wishes. The score provided a nice layer of gloominess to the whole, the cinematography was jaw-dropping, and I can’t help but find the conclusion… fitting. Like many others have said before me: it wasn’t about the Clown Prince of Crime. It was about a marginalized man who inadvertently became a symbol and an outlet for disillusioned citizens to embody their own fear and anger, only to be hated, rejected and forgotten once he declared he shared their fear and anger no longer. A beautiful deconstruction.

16. Scarborn. Another Polish film, but this time it’s a historical action flick. Centered around the Kościuszko Insurrection of 1794 it provides a pretty immersive piece of historical fiction centered around how said Insurrection came to be. Wait through the lengthy build up and the final act will wow you with Tarantino-esque tension and spectacle. Some fantastic cinematography, too!

15. Anora. This hurts me the most, because I believe it’s an impressive offering, but lacks “the sauce”. As great as Mikey Madison was as Anora, as believable as the world and characters around her were, I found insufficient amounts of context to care about her as much as Baker wanted me to. How fucking sad it is that I found TOROS, the main henchman character more interesting and entertaining to watch than her? Didn’t help that Baker couldn’t find the right tone for several scenes, especially the supposedly serious ones overloaded with comedic inserts… But his direction, especially the camera movement was without a doubt a true show of skill, and I cannot find any fault in the cinematography and non-lead performances either.

14. Wrooklyn Zoo. Yet another Polish movie in the mix, and most likely the most special one. It’s about Poland’s modern problems, the virtues and sins of the old and the youth and the absolutely amazing yet painful feeling that is love. While I don’t think our protagonists were amazing characters and the final act relies on a bit of resurrectionist Hollywood bullshit, the movie drips with style, heart and distinct energy that’s hard to put into words. Also, the pacing was fantastic. Made it seem like a movie of twice its length yet endlessly captivating.

13. Civil War. My introduction to Alex Garland, and what an introduction that was! My most favorite thing about it is just how hard it drills into the conflict between journalistic integrity and the pervasive sensationalist nature of the job, especially in America. Every single main character felt like a real person with their own ideas and priorities, everyone embodied their characters to a fault, and I could only watch with wonder and horror as their lives and jobs turned to shit due to the eponymous conflict. The final third is as captivating as it is devastating and can really make you think about the possibility of objective, well-intentioned documentation of tragedies.

12. The Holdovers. Maybe the most wholesome and hilarious thing I saw in 2024. Along the incredible, sharp performances by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa and Da’Vine Joy Randolph wraps Alexander Payne’s whimsical yet touching screenplay. It’s a movie that understands the bitter, but at the same time shows them their current state of being doesn’t have to be what defines their life or gives it purpose.

11. Carry-On. I expected it to be a somewhat interesting execution of a promising premise. But man oh MAN, I was not prepared to witness the absolute CINEMA of it all, not at all! Everyone from Edgerton to Bateman is on their A game, the protagonist and the antagonists constantly outsmarting each other makes for an endlessly tense and riveting dynamic, and even the themes themselves present some interesting commentary about military subcontractors, arms deals and the boogeyman of Russian threat to America.

10. Poor Things. The VERY dodgy implications of what is being done to Bella and the unnecessary POV shift from the source material aside, this was a sublime introduction to Lanthimos. Whatever the scene called for, the man and his crew were more than up for the task. Tension, wonder, elation, terror, despair, hopelessness, cynicism, fulfillment, whimsy… all conveyed with a weirdness I suppose is uniquely his. Also, BRAVO to Jerskin Fendrix for that score. Bizarre yet utterly enthralling in how intrusive and odd it is. And to Emma Stone, who can like no other portray a determined, stoically wisecracking British woman.

9. The A(A)-Team. The final Polish offering. I did not expect to love it as much as I did. But when you get a bunch of terribly scarred yet well-meaning people trying to atone for what they did as alcoholics, a plot that combines the whackier sides of Poland and a very emotional main goal, with vibes and directorial style that keeps you glued to the screen no matter what, you get pretty good fucking cinema. My personal standouts are the little monochrome pencil-driven flashback animations that, combined with the protagonists’ voiceover, explain the mistakes they made and the pain they caused.

8. Priscilla. Cailee Spaeny should’ve been nominated for this, no doubt. She is as believable as her character at 14 as she is at 25. Her ability to transition between ages was just phenomenal. Make up team, Jacob Elordi and Sofia Coppola also deserve genuine praise. But my biggest praise for the film lies in the fact that it managed to make a great story without creating a narrative centered around a specific endeavor or event. It’s just a collection of connected events, yet each of them reveals something interesting about the characters or the world they inhabit.

7. Anatomy of a Fall. Probably the most down-to-earth film in the group. It leaves you with a lack of closure, a feeling of strong ambiguity and uncertainty. Which I suppose was the directorial intent. Great performances from everyone (though the one I’d nominate Sandra Hüller for was in Glazer’s, not Triet’s movie), a compelling mystery, and the courtroom scenes… Oh, they were a fucking blast. It was like watching a dead-serious, prosaic, more sincere version of Ace Attorney. Just as much entertainment and dynamism in the scenes, but without AA’s crazy energy. Best hallmarks of the movie’s quality are the fact I could only nitpick the slightly underwhelming cinematography and the grating 50 Cent track.

6. Speak No Evil. You’re probably surprised to see it up here, but I’mma own it. Not only does Speak No Evil use its vague premise to create a ticking bomb of a plot that once goes off, it fucking TEARS the screen to shreds. After that, it also becomes a fucking MASTERCLASS in tension, my whole body was there ready to give out any minute once our protagonists realized the deep shit they were in. Special accolades to James McAvoy, Mackenzie Davis and Scoot McNairy as far as performances go. There are also some well-conveyed themes about generational trauma poisoning people’s souls, the dangers of the inability to say “no” and the depths some will go to justify their actions. Fantastic filmmaking.

5. The Apprentice. I have to applaud Ali Abbasi for managing to keep the story infused with the typical Trumpian undertones of vanity, hedonism and rapaciousness and not losing the emotion in it. The movie forges the spear of depressive truths about Trump’s world and stabs you with it repeatedly. But eventually, the stab just hurts you somewhere lower, existentially. You don’t even feel for Donald anymore, if you ever did in the first place. All that’s left is Roy and Ivana, and they’re both royally screwed. As is America, if the final shot and real life are anything to go by. But hey, at least we got a three-composer-collaboration of a score that is both cohesive and fucking excellent in quality. How about that? (Nominate Dirkov, Holmes and Irvine for the Oscar, you COWARDS!)

4. Conclave. The one movie where my firm expectations regarding its quality were thoroughly fulfilled. When you look at it as a whole, you may come to a conclusion it’s like Oppenheimer, but in a church setting. I mean, I sure did get the impression, considering the sharp, visually clean and orderly directing/editing style, the rhythmically oppressive yet graceful score and the raw yet elegant acting of the performers involved. Fiennes earned his Best Actor nom, no doubt, but I’m secretly hoping for a Best Supporting nom for Carlos Diehz as Vincent Benítez. He sold the man’s honesty, kindness and timidness with such conviction I only doubted it due to a fakeout Berger planted last minute. As far as their characters’ innocence goes, this year only Cailee Spaeny matched Diehz. The movie plays like a purebred conspiracy thriller, questioning everyone’s motives, infusing paranoia and uncertainty into every scene. You have ZERO fucking confusion about the extent to which the Holy See lost its way, because certain frames just scream “This can’t be made right, can IT?!” But the movie’s true genius lies in its twist, because it reframes both the movie’s themes and characters in ways never explicitly stated, yet hard-hitting once inferred. This would’ve been a masterpiece had the secondary antagonist been more fleshed out.

3. Dune Part 2. Denis Villeneuve and Greg Fraser ain’t skipped a single goddamn beat on the production. Hans Zimmer did, but even with more repetition his musical material is top-notch. The movie sure takes a while to get going, but I have nothing but applause for it for how effectively it establishes its antagonist (really crappy how they did very little with him in the end, though), and how the Harkonnenian clusterfuck on Arrakis beautifully falls apart with time. When Paul ascends to Prophet level and goes sicko mode on the establishment, the movie kicks into its highest gear on all levels. We understand everyone’s position in the conflict and what they’re willing to do to achieve their goals. Which makes it so frustrating Emperor Shaddam and Feyd-Rautha do not get nearly enough time to have their political and philosophical perspectives be expressed. But still, the movie is lethally efficient when it comes to… Chani and her disillusionment arc. Not only is she an excellent mirror to the bloodthirsty Gurney and the increasingly fanatical Stilgar, Zendaya turns in some incredibly believable acting that had me rooting for her with no questions. I can’t wait for Messiah, and Shai-Hulud bless Villeneuve’s team!

2. The Zone of Interest. That movie hits on a deeper level. I did not actually comprehend what I saw until I was back home from the theater, and that’s when I started crying. The movie is indeed viciously effective in how much it can tear your heart out without you seeing or realizing it in the first place. Insanely beautiful cinematography, and the score… 3 tracks in the whole movie, yet they’re all fucking Oscar-worthy. Great acting. And the theme of invisibility… it’s clear enough you know what’s the context Glazer applies it to, but also subtle enough everyone will have ideas about what it means to say and which other contexts it can be applied to in real life. Probably the best candidate for 2023’s BP barring Oppenheimer.

1. The Substance. If The Zone of Interest is bold, then Coralie Fargeat’s project is BOLD. Not really in its theme, but in how it’s executed. It’s an attack on the senses, in both a good and bad way. The screen sucks you in and shits you out time and time again. You’re in an abusive relationship with it, just like Liz Sparkle is with The Substance/Sue. Huge props for the trailer, because it fooled me so hard into thinking we’d be getting an individual v individuals/society conflict, while we got an individual v self conflict. I was watching with all my interest as Liz and Sue tried to undermine each other yet being constantly forced to rely on one another, as the situation got worse and worse. It’s not that a person is trying to destroy themself, it’s how extreme the degradation is. The movie knows no fucking restraint sometimes, and in those times the terror can be mixed with perverse glee and karmic satisfaction, gives those times coincide with character punishment, but when it manages to show restraint, the horror stings more profoundly. In 2024 few things in cinema managed to scare the crap out of me, and one of them was Sue smiling hysterically to a mirror as several of her teeth were falling out. The Substance thrives in the hateful and the loving, the gross and the tantalizing, the sinister and the kind. At its heart it’s a story of a woman who could not forgive herself for something she had no control over. You really see it in 3 scenes only, but those 3 scenes are what’s enough to make the movie sincere. Moore and Qualley are insanely convincing. God! Just give it the BP already!

All in all, a great year. I won’t say it’s superior to 2023 or anything, but I think I’d rate The Substance on the same level as Babylon (a delayee from 2022 that topped the 2023 chart), which I suppose is saying something. But now I know one thing for sure. Cinema has become something I’ll probably love forever.",2,0,1735926614.0,2025-01-03 17:50:14,False

dune2,dune 2,1hrdoo0,2024 is such the weird year of movies.,"There’s have been a writer strike and got ended last 2023. Many films got delayed including MCU movies. Dune Pt 2 is the best and popular film last year. Challengers is also so good. Conclave as well that I didn’t expect it that is a PG Rated film. Wicked is the best musical of 2024 I’ve ever seen. Fall Guy was underrated but peak cinema. Furiosa is great and some best film but a box office bomb. There’s isn’t many Comic book movies releasing in 2024 and they most failed except for Deadpool and Wolverine(extremely peak cinema). Joker Folie à Deux is the most anticipated film of 2024 and they just failed as a sequel musical. Animated films are alright with The Wild Robot and Inside Out 2 except with Moana 2(I haven’t seen it yet).  Kung Fu Panda 4 is good and mid(not as good first 2 or 3) Despicable Me 4 is very mid and leads to box office success. Flow is very interesting. Transformers One is so great and good but not sure why it’s a box office failure. Much spinoffs and sequels releasing in 2024 like Quiet Place day one, Gladiator 2(The first one is better), Alien Romulus, and Mufasa. Kingdom and the planet apes seems the best sequel and spinoff film of 2024. Fuck the Godzilla x Kong movie(weird film) Twisters is so underrated(much country music assshit). Bad boys 4 is a great and peak action film. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice is the most sequel nostalgia of Halloween lovers. Sonic 3 is the peak video game cinema of 2024. 
A24 and Neon did much of some good films like Civil War, Longlegs and Love lies bleeding. Heretic is my favorite. But so many Horror movies releasing in 2024 like Smile 2, Terrifer 3 and Speak No evil. Thriller films as well like Trap and Blink Twice. I havent seen Nosferatu yet there’s many people said it’s a peak horror film of 2024, and I’m going to watch today. The Substance is the top 5 films and the number one horror film of 2024 but it’s really much disturbing including the ending. Not sure to rewatch it lol. Anora is alright, there’s a chance to win Academy Award but this movie have much sexual content and some drugs in the movie that I’ve ever seen. Ending of Anora is so very satisfying, sadness and a bit disappointing. The Brutalist did came out last year and didn’t have the wide release yet. Same with Nickel Boys. Should be the best 2024 movie and could release in 2025. 
I hope 2025 cinema will be better than 2024. 2026 is so stacked with films. 

Top and best 5 films of 2024 that I have seen are Challengers, Dune Pt 2, Anora, The Substance and Conclave. ",0,4,1735768666.0,2025-01-01 21:57:46,False

* means re-watched

I very much enjoyed the movies down to place 34.

This is purely by how much I enjoyed them and not by how good a movie is done. I know Psycho is a huge step stone for cinematography but I still just disliked watching it. I am also aware Interstellar is well done, but I couldn't wait for it to be over. I really liked the story of the DnD movie but I heavily disliked the actors. And I think I am just too old (or too little American?) to watch Airplane for the first time and find it funny.",0,22,1735728759.0,2025-01-01 10:52:39,False

dune2,dune 2,1hqhzh5,Looking for website that lists all previously un-released movies and shows,"Im looking for a website that provides a list of all new movies and shows. By new I mean previously unavailable on any other streaming service, just released, brand new. 

I've been using JustWatch, but it does not actually filter for new content.  I can filter for new, which provides content that was added to streaming services regardless of release date. I can add the filter to show only released this year, but I still get movie and shows that are added to streaming services from earlier this year.  For example, Dune part 2 was just added to netflix and even though its been available to stream since March it still shows up under new because netflix just added it.

Any help is appreciated :) ",0,6,1735661792.0,2024-12-31 16:16:32,False
dune2,dune 2,1hqhgbd,I saw 71 movies in a theater this year. Here is my Personal Ranking List ,"Hello to those interested and about to read/skim this list and either comment on how good or bad it is. \[I wrote a ranking list last year of the 54 movies I saw in a theater. My New Year's Resolution was to see 55 movies in a theaters this year since I'm subscribed to A-List, and have 4 AMCs within 25 minutes of my house, and I surpassed the mark by 16 films this year with 71. Before you read the list/reviews, here are some quick notes:

\- 71-64: Pretty much the worst films I saw this year. These are films I would not recommend to anyone in the future, where I will mostly say negative things about the film (aka.... It Stinks!)

\- 63-56: are watchable films, with decent elements, but also aren't that good to me personally, and are possibly lacking in other areas. I would likely recommend the film to someone I know who would enjoy it, but also give a critique or two that I thought was missing

\- 55-27: Pretty much passable/watchable films that I at least thought were worth sitting through once, and could see myself sitting through again at some point in the future

\- 26-13: These are films I found pretty enjoyable from start to finish with very few issues that I could find in between. The higher these films are, the likelier it is that I would want to or be happy to watch these films again

\- 12-1: These are my personal best of the best from the year.

\- Some of these reviews are hyperlinked to my Instagram page. Feel free to give these a look, and follow if you would like

The List:

71.. Werewolves - Directed by Steven C. Miller: It REALLY Stinks

70.. The Book of Clarence - Directed by The Bullitts: I saw this as part of #AMCsScreenUnseen. And truth be told, it will be the last one. I am admittedly not much of a religious fanatic, so watching a film that bordered between”parody” and “epic” wasn’t a lot of fun for me or my fiancé. I did learn though why the Romans actually nailed Jesus’s hands and feet to the cross. So that was neat. It Stinks

69.. Borderlands - Directed by Eli Roth: Thanksgiving II can't come soon enough. It Stinks

68.. Night Swim - Directed by Bryce McGuire: Aka “We bought a pool”…. These are actual lines in the movie, and it’s what I always think of now when I’m reminded of this January filler. Mind you this is a quote from a supposedly famous baseball player that has millions, so how did he not purchase a place with a swimming pool before this….? It Stinks

67.. Argylle - Directed by Matthew Vaughn: I can only support you because of Kingsman for sooooo long before I have to say “enough”…. “Enough” with this Matt. We get it. Kingsman is cool, but this has been a wild fail of a universe for him to be building, and this latest installment in the “Kingsmen” universe is easily the worst and most forgettable one yet. It Stinks

66.. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire- Directed by Gil Kenan: I felt like you could tell how much Bill Murray was coerced into this movie because “$$$” talks. Just a painfully unfunny remake that included a subplot where Phoebe falls for a ghost, and tries to become one in order for her to receive her “7 minutes in heaven”, only to be double-crossed instead because it was all part of some elaborate plot to coerce her into doing all of this… if what I described sounds confusing, imagine what it felt like realizing this in the theater. It Stinks

65.. Kinds of Kindness - Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos: I saw “Poor Things” last year and had this rounding out my personal top 20. I also know that Yorgos makes polarizing films so this is in his wheelhouse. It’s three short films with one side character that interweaves them all together. For some, especially those that enjoy all of Yorgo’s work, this is another good installment. For me? Kinds of Kindness was just kind of “meh”.

64.. Here - Directed by Robert Zemeckis: Truth be told. This movie would’ve been further down the list if it wasn’t for the fact that this was part of a Double Feature that my fiancé and I did instead of watching the election results, and I will take this film 10 times out of 10 over watching that political theatre. Robert’s love for technology really seems to hurt the story in this one, along with the fact that a place’s “history” doesn’t actually feel historical when you watch it happen on screen.

63.. Joker: Folie a Deux - Directed by Todd Phillips: When the movie first ended I honestly have to admit I enjoyed it… but then I realized later that a big part of it was because my audience was SO upset by the final 10 minutes of the movie. Part satire, drama, and more “karaoke” than musical, it felt more like a parody of a musical than an actual one with Gaga barely being in this movie for the amount of marketing for this. You’re definitely not gonna be talking about this one the same way like the first movie.

62.. The Beekeeper - Directed by David Ayer: It’s a Jason Statham film. If you even like his movies, then park your butt on the couch and come watch another fun and mindless roller coaster where Claire Huxtable’s money is stolen, and it is up to Jason Stratham to save the day! (This is the actual plot of this movie)

61.. ISS - Directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite: The first 2/3rds of this movie are actually very well done, but it falls apart rapidly by the 1/3rd act where you then start pointing out some plotting issues. It’s a decent time if you can forget how it ends.

60.. Drive-Away Dolls - Directed by Ethan Coen: The Coen Bros. will always have my support for The Big Lebowski, so I was not going to miss this “low-stakes but fun” coming-of-age film where two women get caught in the middle of a heist involving the dumbest criminals I’ve watched on film this year. For those that are saying “I’m looking for something different with films I’m seeing these days”, there’s not many that are as out there with their plot than this one.

59.. I Saw the TV Glow - Directed by Jane Schoenbrun: If you find yourself going to the movies as often as I do, you will eventually stumble upon what I call your personal “Beau is Afraid” film. The “Beau is Afraid” film I basically term as a film that is well-directed, and even makes compels you all the way until the end… and then once it ends, you wonder “what the fuck just happened?”, and this is my “Beau is Afraid” film for this year. It is a well directed and acted film about two people growing up in the 90s, and then becoming older before even knowing it. It is very anxiety inducing, and will end with you feeling pretty uneasy

58.. IF - Directed by John Krasinski: This is a kid’s film that is truly for kids, while also tying in an adult stake of a father going through “surgery” (although it’s not specified what that surgery even is?). There are some nice moments, notably when Bea is creating the imaginary world around her, but it’s likely something your kid will play on repeat far more than you will. If you’re a parent, get headphones

57.. The Fall Guy - Directed by David Leitch: An ode to stuntmen, that certainly had great action scenes. However, I personally thought that it was too far between a slowly drawn out plot. Come for the action, make dinner for the dialogue.

56.. Babygirl - Directed by Halina Reijn: I was a big fan of “Bodies, Bodies, Bodies”, and this is a decent follow up from the director regarding the cinematography. An incredibly well shot film. However, I still question how Romy did all of these objectively fireable/“voted off the board” offenses, and the biggest penalty is that she takes on a more BTS role as the CEO while those “protecting/blackmailing” her are given higher positions. Not to mention that the final sequence in the film heavily implied to me that she found her “sexual awakening” and repaired her marriage through this love affair, and should have possibly done it sooner. So it kind of felt like a 2 hour dissertation to have an affair, when 99% of the time when practiced, you are justifiably scrutinized hard for it, while also ruining lives, including your own, in its wake. And it’s barely touched in this movie. Until promiscuity becomes a true norm, I don’t see what was depicted in the film actually going over the way it did in Babygirl.

55.. Kung Fu Panda 4 - Directed by Mike Mitchell: It’s another film that pretty much pales in comparison to the original, but it’s still passable in every way as well offering more of what we’ve all come to love from Poe. My favorite part though had to be the ending credits where Tenacious D did their cover of “Hit Me Baby One More Time”.

54.. The Garfield Movie - Directed by Mark Dindal: I won’t deny that this film is very low on my list, but I will say that for a film no one was really clamoring for, I enjoyed this a lot. At least a lot more than the live-action ones that came out in 2004 when I was a kid. It’s more of the same from the feline companion, but the animation looks good, and it treats the source material fairly well with who Garfield really is… a lazy and food loving cat who begrudgingly loves the people in his life.

53.. Moana 2 - Directed by David Ledoux Miller, Jason Hand, and David Derrick Jr.: This is an interesting film because it was initially not intended to be one. The animated mini-series wound up blossoming into a pretty worthy sequel that does well to build on Moana’s universe, while also giving us the fun we’ve come to expect from Maui. I should note though that it does not hit the emotional highs as the first, so hopefully the third film will go back to its own “roots” and rehire LMM to create some more classics.

52.. Trap - Directed by M. Night Shyamalan: The film is not too memorable, and admittedly can be considered a “front” for M. Night’s daughter to help her own career (she’s one of the leads in this movie), but gosh is Josh Hartnett compelling on screen. He pretty much carries this film to a passable status because of how good of an actor he is. Shoutout for Cudi as well in his brief cameo. If you can put Cudi in anything, it definitely makes it at least a few points better for me.

51.. Nosferatu - Directed by Robert Eggers: After 102 years, Nosferatu was finally resurrected and given an update. And it is certainly every bit as gothic and horrifying as its original… but also I wasn’t a huge fan of the pacing. It took a while for the dread to settle in for me. However, I am happy that this was given a chance by Eggers to even be made.

50.. Mean Girls - Directed by Samantha Jane, Arturo Perez Jr.: While I don’t really peg it as the true classic that defined the mid-late 2000s, I personally enjoyed this musical follow-up.

49.. Wonka - Directed by Paul King: My 1st film of 2024. When this was first announced, I do recall a collective “why”, but the truth is that this was a nice film that gives some fun backstory to Willy Wonka and how he built his factory. Also helped reveal Timothee’s range and expand into family films

48.. Twisters - Directed by Lee Isaac Chung: It was fun watching the pre-interview screening and hearing how the cast was on location for this film, and truth be told, it’s not a bad sequel from a film released 28 years earlier. In fact, the technology today helps enhance it for a screen that was worthy for IMAX/Dolby. There’s not much plot, and the climax borders on “suspension”, but it’s still a thrilling ride. If you FEEL it! CHASE it!

47.. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire - Directed by Adam Wingard: Living in the “Godzillasance” is one of the things keeping me hyped in life currently. If you would’ve told me this as a kid? Even then I would not believe you and discuss how “Zilla” ruined the franchise. So I will pretty much watch all films until the wheels fall off. I mention this because this is not necessarily the best “Godzilla” film. Truth be told, it’s about 75% Kong, and 25% Godzilla. But those few scenes that Godzilla is in are still awesome. That fight between Kong and Godzilla in Egypt was bonkers.

46.. Abigail - Directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett: This film reminded me a lot of “Renfield”, which was a favorite of mine last year. However, I felt it took itself a bit too seriously compared to other campy vampire films like “Renfeld” and the classic “From Dusk Till Dawn”

45.. Boy Kills World - Directed by Moritz Mohr: It’s nice to see Bill Skarsgard without a ton of makeup on. Not to mention he gets to be a cool badass in this movie that involves H Jon Benjamin doing narration cause he’s a mute. Thie lack of “Bob Belcher” in the 2nd half lost it a bit for me.

44.. Lisa Frankenstein - Directed by Zelda Williams: Robin Williams’s daughter’s directorial debut, and it was a fun and campy time where the stakes were very low, and everyone involved seems to be enjoying themselves. It’s worth it just to watch everyone have a fun time with this movie.

43.. Cuckoo - Directed by Tilman Singer: This film was a pretty supervise trip. I won’t forget when the girl starts hallucinating in the car and I was wondering at first if the film was breaking, and then realizing that she’s losing control. As someone who’s dabbled with hallucinogenics, that is a real feeling that happens. This ties into this weird undercurrent that stays with this film compared to the others on this list.

42.. Love Lies Bleeding - Directed by Rose Glass: This movie was sexy and violent, and also comes with an ending twist that I’ve only come to expect A24 to deliver on. If it was any other studio, I would’ve likely hated the ending, but it’s A24, and they’ve built up so much goodwill that I can respect the originality on it.

41.. In A Violent Nature - Directed by Chris Nash: The ending is divisive, but I personally loved the whole idea that we’re watching the movie through the killer’s perspective. The dread of seeing how he was about to murder the people was a new feeling for me with horror. The ending is ambiguous enough for a possible sequel, and I hope that happens.

40.. Tuesday - Directed by Diana O. Pusic: A medium on death through the perspective of a parrot doesn’t sound like a usual concept for a film, but Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Lola Petticrew make this a nice emotional study of a mom coming to terms with her daughter’s terminal diagnosis. For myself, I was fortunate to be part of a Q&A with the director and actors after which enhanced the experience.

39.. Thelma - Directed by Josh Margolin: Another nice little medium on aging that was based on a personal experience by the director when his own grandmother was almost scammed out of money. The piece is very personal as evidenced by the fact that he not only directed the film, but wrote and edited it as well. And what results is a low-stakes, but relatable piece about our loved ones and how we accept our age.

38.. The Bikeriders  - Directed by Jeff Nichols: A nice film that, much like the people the actors are portraying, seems to coast by until the film reaches its conclusion. It’s very well acted, and if you’re curious about a part of America that you might know about, this can educate you a bit on it, but there are elements missing that make this a a classic like “Easy Rider”

37.. Blitz - Directed by Steve McQueen: The WWII historian in me is a sucker for a film that actually covers the Blitz. And when the action is really happening, it does VERY well where I can’t help but respect it. However, there are continuity issues I spotted during the film which left me confused once it concluded.

36.. \[Red One\](https://www.instagram.com/p/DCR1FKhP5EV/?igsh=MXVnaTdtaHJ5ZXlr) - Directed by Jake Kasdan: Maybe it’s my admitted love for The Final Boss since I am a big pro-wrestling stan, but I really didn’t find this to be nearly as bad as I thought it was. It was pretty much a Marvel film, but stripped of the IP and framing it around Santa. Not the best film, but not the worst. Can certainly see kids gravitating and watching it again just to reenact scenes that happened.

35.. Bad Boys: Ride or Die - Directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah: You would’ve though that they’d flip “Ride or Die” and “4 Life” since it makes more sense, but I digress. This is a fun time with Martin Lawrence pretty much stealing the show with every scene he was in. I was cackling through half of his lines. Also, love how they gave Marcus the ultimate redemption arc.\\

34.. Monkey Man - Directed by Dev Patel: What happens when you take an orphan who is angry with the world and throw him into the caste system? Monkey man. A strong directorial from director/star Dev Patel, who takes his revenge out unmercifully on his way to the top.

33.. The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare - Directed by Guy Ritchie: It’s a slick take on an unknown WWII story by Guy Ritchie. IF you like his films like I do, you will have a good time with this since it’s basically Henry Cavill and Alan Ritchson + others killing Nazis.

32.. Piece by Piece - Directed by Morgan Neville: There’s a possibility that this was solely done through “LEGOs” because Universal wanted ot retain the rights. There’s likely truth to it, but I also would not be surprised if one of the most influential music producers of the 21st century wanted to make this doc “feel” different than others. And the truth is that it’s a great and innovative time. You kind of get to peak inside his mind a bit thanks to the animation as opposed to if this was live-action. The great music he produced is also littered throughout so this can be a good time to bond with your kid about great music that was collaborated on by a great producer.

31.. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes - Directed by Wes Ball: Prior to Kingdom, Wes’s only directing credit was for The Maze Runner, which I admittedly don’t have a huge desire to see currently. So when I heard he was announced as the director for this movie I was admittedly hesitant…  After? I hope he’s given the keys to build the universe. Very fine follow up that inches us that much closer to the eventual remake of “PotA”

30.. Gladiator II - Directed by Ridley Scott: The movie’s scale and scope are pretty epic this time around compared to the first, and Denzel just owns this movie the moment he steps on screen. He’s the man. If he was not in this movie, it would be a lot further down my list.

29.. Transformers: One- Directed by Josh Cooley: It’s unfortunate that this film was DOA, because it’s easily the best Transformers film I watched, and this is from someone who is more of a passive fan. The origin stories of Optimus and Megatron felt genuine, and Chris gave a great VO performance. I felt by the end that he was the Optimus Prime of my childhood.

28.. Sonic the Hedgehog 3 - It's rare when the 3rd part winds up being the best, but this is exactly what Sonic the Hedgehog 3 was. It was probably the closest adaptation that I've seen of the original games, and Jim Carrey just seemed to be enjoying playing as Dr. Eggman again. The laser dance sequence was also my personal favorite dance scene of the year.

27.. Heretic - Directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods: There is apparently a lot of personal experience put into this movie, with comments that I read speaking about how this movie did a pretty good job portraying the “missionary” experience of mormonism. And while I can’t admittedly say the finish was my taste, it was the very compellingly disturbing performance from ""rom-com"" legend Hugh Grant.

26.. Y2K - Directed by Kyle Mooney: It’s been a long time since I’ve cackled in a theater for a b-level comedy, and this was just the perfect blend of a nostalgia and cringe to remind me of a time before iPhones, where Fred Durst and “The Thong Song” was on everyone’s mixtape

25.. Deadpool & Wolverine - Directed by Shawn Levy: This will hopefully be the shot of adrenaline that Marvel needs to course correct while they’ve got the chance. For the first R-rated MCU film, it was a very fun time, and had me straight up geeking out during the bus sequence when Wolverine put on the mask.

24.. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice - Directed by Tim Burton: I’ve got love for the Juice. And watching the town of Winter River come back to life was a joy to see, along with how much fun Michael Keaton seemed to be having paying Beetlejuice again. He’s infectious in the role, and while it admittedly falls short of the first film, there’s room for one more possible movie to help really stick this landing.

23.. Longlegs - Directed by Oz Perkins: What a thriller this was. I was surprised at just how off-putting Nicholas Cage actually as in this role. It might be one of my favorites simply for that fact because I was creeped out by him for most of this film. The twist was also fun for myself, especially since the ending was pretty bleak

22.. Speak No Evil - Directed by Christian Dafdrup: This film is pretty much the inverse of Longlegs where you can probably spot the twist coming, but it does not take away from the thrill of the journey to get there. James McAvoy is at his creepy best, and it is disturbing to watch how twisted he becomes as the film continues.

21.. The Wild Robot - Directed by Chris Sanders: The only thing I could think of once this concluded? “Wow. What a delightful movie”. Age won’t matter in this heartfelt film about finding your way, being accepted, and surviving, even if the road is treacherous. Equal parts funny and touching, it can either be a great family film, or a great medium on what it means to be a parent.

20.. Inside Out 2 - Directed by Kelsey Mann: I’m a clinical therapist by trade. So I have an incredibly soft spot for Inside Out and how it teaches us about who we are and the emotions that make us up. So of course I have been using this sequel as a resource since it honestly does an even better job explaining the emotions we have now, compared to the first. Life becomes more complex and socially complicated the older we get. Little things we say or do can have big ramifications that we can ruminate over like an endless replay. And Inside Out 2 did a great job explaining some of these new emotions, with anxiety leading the pack. If you have not seen it yet, I highly recommend giving it a watch to at least understand our emotions a bit better.

19.. One Life - Directed by James Hawes: Not many know the heroic tale of Nichols Winston and his courage to have 669 Jewish children adopted before WWII began. And this film does a fine job discussing the stakes, the drama, and the courage that Nicholas and his peers had to help these kids find safety before it was too late. It is a difficult film to watch, but also necessary to show the humanity that is still there in others.

18.. The Apprentice - Directed by Ali Abbasi: There are a lot that have had enough of this person, and are dreading what is to come. So it is appropriate to say “why the fuck do we need more media covering him?” Well the truth is that regardless of your opinion, the incoming president is going to be looked at as a very historical figure in human history, and it’s films like The Apprentice that will hopefully teach a future generation about how we got here, and why it was awful to let it happen. I wish luck to the future impersonators of the former tv host, because Sebastian Stan gives a haunting performance that sets the bar incredibly high for future impersonations. By the end of this movie, I thought he had actually become him. And this doesn’t get into my thoughts on Jeremy Strong as Roy Cohn. Legitimately jaw-dropping performance by him. Due to the risks involved that both of these men have taken, I do hope that it pays off in some Oscar nominations, because they do deserve it.

17.. Didi - Directed by Sean Wang: Avery intimate film about an “American experience” through the life of a Korean teenager learning to find his own place in the world. He’s got a mom who cares for him, but is also hoping for him to be more structured, and a grandma who the main character can’t help but care for, along with an annoying sister who he begrudgingly loves. It’s a very human film that touches on a lot of beats that make this a great film worth seeing.

16.. My Old Ass - Directed by Megan Park: Part “Arrival”, and part “About Time”, this film is a lovely and poignant piece about love, loss, and what this person would do if they knew about the inevitable. It is a very touching movie about what our heart wants.

15.. Late Night with the Devil - Directed by Cameron & Colin Cairnes: Led by famous character actor David Dastmalchian, this is the first movie I found since “Nightcrawler” to flip the lens on the media itself, and what exactly “drives” our interest. It is done as a “found” documentary film, which helps add to the uneasiness as the film continues. David does a genuinely good job carrying the lead which hopefully leads to more opportunities in the future, and while the final act is divisive, it is still an interesting take on the media, and how far one is willing to go to grab a rating.

14.. A Quiet Place: Day One - Directed by Michael Sarnoski: Some will say it didn’t show enough destruction of NYC, but this to me was just like Cloverfield where you feel more of the peril of the characters who are stuck in the city with no idea on what exactly is going on. Given the budget was also only $67 million, it is impressive what little destruction scenes Michael was able to capture on film, and tied it into a human story of a person enjoying one last slice of pizza at the end of the world.

13.. Smile 2 - Directed by Parker Finn: Because of I use film as a self-care activity, my fiancé has come along with me to enjoy pretty much every film that is out in theaters. She has also watched other movies to catch her up on sequels. And this was very important because she whispered to me at the beginning of Smile 2 that what was happening was canonically 6 days after the person saw the main character kill herself in the first movie. This was important to me because this film is not going to hold your hand. It’s going to mess with you from the start, making you second guess everything that you’re watching as the host latches itself onto a popstar, and is prepared to start a mass casualty event once it's done with her.

12.. Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga - Directed by George Miller: It’s a damn shame this movie didn’t take off. Like, I know it wasn’t something we were asking for. But my god, I am SO happy that I went to watch this. The gates of Valhalla are still just as shiny and chrome as ever in this prequel, where we learn more of the lore that led to the insane action film of 2015. And there is one particular sequence called the “Stairway to Nowhere” that is probably one of the most well shot sequences to be released this year. In addition, Chris Hemsworth gives his best performance to date play the diabolical Dementus, who pretty much is the inverse of Thor. He’s dirty, ugly, a menace, and does not care about anyone. That is, except for “Littal D”. If you are a fan of the Mad Max saga, then it is more than worth traveling back to the wasteland for this.

11.. Anora - Directed by Sean Baker: Earlier I mentioned how I watched “Here” to distract me from this year’s general election, I watched another as well, and I could not be happier that it was this. What an amazingly well-crafted film. It’s a dirty and real take on what we are hoping for with our “American Dream”, and Mikey absolutely SHINES in this role that was legitimately made for her. She is “Anora”, and I don’t think any actress could really pull off the role as well as she did. There is lots of word swirling that this is going to be an “Oscar” darling, and I do hope that it is because it is equal parts sexy, hilarious, and tragic.

10.. Saturday Night - Directed by Jason Reitman: Being up front, I am a huge SNL stan, and will always admire those that have made it onto the show. What not many know about though is just how much of a “maverick” this show and Lorne were. The executives did not give this show much of a chance, along with some of Lorne’s actors going AWOL hours before the show was supposed to air, and a set that literally ignited hours before the first show. How Lorne actually got this program off the ground is just as amazing as it is for him to keep it running for 50 years, and this film does an admirable job showing the chaos and love that is behind this cultural staple in TV history.

9.. Memoir of a Snail - Directed by Adam Elliot: My favorite animated film this year. Adam directed another film a while back called “Max & Mary” that was also very well done. “Memoir of a Snail” pretty much adds elements that were lacking in the previous film, and enhances it to help become an even more personal experience about a melancholic woman who hoards snails to as a way to shelter herself from all of the stressors that have occurred in her life. It’s tragic, and hopeful, and makes you hope for more adult animated films.

8.. Civil War - Directed by Alex Garland: The title speaks for itself, doesn’t it? It is a film taking place through the lens of war photographers. These people help push Alex’s bigger story about what it might look like if it all goes to hell in this country, and he doesn’t make it easy. This movie reminded me a lot of Contagion in how it tried to ground itself to make it feel like “this CAN happen”. The only difference between Contagion and Civil War is that this film actually moved me where I felt shocked and depressed after. It is a very bleak outlook on our future, but one that I can’t help but respect just for even attempting to make an uncomfortable movie like Civil War.

7.. A Real Pain - Directed by Jesse Eisenberg: Another “lived experience” film that hits deeply to me due to my own cultural roots. As a Jewish person, I question my existence constantly, and this film pretty much encapsulates that experience for me as a millennial who has a direct lineage to family members who passed away our survived from the Holocaust. The love we have for others run deep, and it can be exhausting… but we still love them despite what they do, and it’s what I love and appreciate about this film the most

6.. Alien: Romulus - Directed by Fede Alvarez: I’ve waited too long to finally watch a proper Alien movie on a movie screen, and I finally got it with this addition by Fede. This film pretty much takes the genre back to its roots about just why this franchise is so terrifying to begin with. The movie intentionally moves at a slow pace at first, but once the characters go inside that incubator chamber… 0-1000 in an instant, and it doesn’t let up until it ends. This is exactly what fans of the Alien franchise had been hoping for, and I’m glad I can finally say I saw a legitimately terrifying Alien movie on the big screen in my life.

5.. DUNE: Part II- Directed by Denis Villeneuve: If you thought Part I of this epic saga on Arrakis was wild, the 2nd Part pretty much adds onto everything, with strong performances by all who were involved, but especially Javier Bardem, who channels his inner “Monty Python” to deliver a hilarious, but also very realistic take on a devout follower who believes that Timothee is the Mahdi. And the truth is, by the end of this movie I was ready to crown him the Mahdi myself. This was an epic continuation of a saga that has one more battle to be prepared for.

4.. Wicked: Part I - Directed by Jon Chu: I love broadway. I find it a fantastic medium where craft, music, acting, and dancing come to life all in an instant. Translating a broadway show to become a movie is not easy, but Jon and his crew knocked it out of the part with the first rendition of Wicked. I found myself loving a lot of parts to this movie. From the singing, to the feeling of being transported back into Oz for the first time since watching the original, to Ariana’s rendition of Popular, to “Defying Gravity”, to the fact that 2 hours and 40 minutes did not feel that long, to the fact that the movie ended like it was the “intermission”, and not the true end to the film. Jon and his team seemed to spare no expense when it came to making this musical feel like we’re watching the broadway play at a massive discount. And I appreciate them for that because broadway plays are expensive. They all delivered a stunning film that feels every bit as magical as the first time we all stepped into Oz. What is great for them now is they can ride the momentum of the first film into Part II next year without doing anything because they already finished the shoot. Can’t deny it is a brilliant marketing strategy that will probably make massive money in the long run. I know I’m going to be there opening night to see the finale.

3.. Kill - Directed by Nikhil Nagesh Bhat: As much as I love musicals… I love one man army’s even more. And this genuinely could be the scariest one man army I have ever come across. I first learned about this film from one of those trailers that are packed with reviews that say “you have to see this movie.” Since I had nothing better to do on July 4th I figured, why not? And I’m very glad I did that because Amrit Rathod is the scariest dude walking the planet. I am fully convinced he can take on Jason Bourne and John Wick and come out on top after watching this insanity. Make no mistake, Amrit is a different animal compared to the others. He lives by a code, and once it’s broken, you better start preparing your last rites, cause he will break you down until you’re absolutely nothing... And THEN he will kill you. I honestly think this movie could’ve possibly pushed the genre even further because of some of the there are simply kills that I have not seen before on the big screen, and this movie was not shy at all in delivering them.

2.. The Zone of Interest - Directed by Jonathan Glazer: Probably the most educational film about The Holocaust that has ever been made, or aside from since Schindler’s List. What I love about this movie is that unlike Schindler, there is nothing good about this film. It is awful. And you come to realize just how “banal” we truly are as a species once it’s done. I found myself growing more detested as the film continued. And that is its point. At one time this was not a movie. This was a real, world-changing event that occurred where people were sent to concentration camps to suffer and die, and all of us as a species grew desensitized to the point that we did not feel any remorse for these “fellow” humans (and truth be told, I still don’t)… all the while the scum were standing less than 20 feet away pretending that they were not committing the atrocities that they were. This is the inverse of “One Life” where instead of educating us on the good that humans are capable of, it shows us just how evil we really are, and that is admittedly a much bigger reality than the miracles and good people that DO occur during these awful times. In order to possibly prevent it in the future, we need to still educate today. And this film is as educational as it gets.

1.. American Fiction - Directed by Cord Jefferson: It’s unfortunate this movie came out in the completely packed year that was 2023, because this is easily one of my favorite “American experience” movies I remember, and I think it’s because of how mundane it is that I love it so much. The characters are going through their own sets of trauma that would be very similar to ours, and also have a dynamic that feels very natural to the relationships we have with our loved ones. Jeffery Wright and Sterling K. Brown also give fantastic performances that are equally hilarious, endearing, and thought-provoking as well. What is so fantastic too is how much they make the dialogue feel natural. It really feels like you’re living the life with this writer as he uncovers the hypocrisy and racial dynamics in an incredibly niche aspect of society. The way Jefferson makes it all thread perfectly was so much fun. My favorite part though that cements this as my favorite has to be the ending. It’s kind of abrupt, but also in this very well done way that reminds us that just like the main characters in this movie, life will continue onwards, and it’s what we do with it that is really going to matter the most.

Re-releases I watched:

\- In addition to the 71 films I watched, I also saw two re-releases, Coraline and Interstellar to total out to 73 movies I went to see.

Conclusion:

I saw a lot more films than I did last year, which is great because it (hopefully) shows to me that the industry itself is at least churning out regular features again. If you would've told me this back in 2020, there's no way I'd believe you. While the recovery isn't there yet, and there are genuine critiques on a lack of originality, it's nice to know how strong this year was when it comes to regular releases. So with that, I hope you enjoyed reading the list as much as I did watching, ranking, reflecting, and reviewing on the year that was 2024 in movies. Would like to know your thoughts on the list and your personal favorites as well. To 2025, the year of our remake, and Superman.",7,36,1735660309.0,2024-12-31 15:51:49,False

dune2,dune 2,1hpp7yt,"December 27-29 Box Office Recap: 'Sonic 3' and 'Mufasa' fight for the top spot at the box office. 'Nosferatu' opens with a fantastic $40.3 million in its first five days, already becoming Robert Eggers' highest grossing film. 'A Complete Unknown' settles for sixth place with $23.1 million.","https://preview.redd.it/k21dn07d40ae1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b2edf912cefe80f8f6936c9ec0814e5006ae794

#**Normally you'd wait till the Weekend Actuals are out. But the numbers are delayed due to the holidays, so you'll only have estimates for now. The same could happen next week.**

It was a fierce battle at the box office.

***Sonic 3*** and ***Mufasa: The Lion King*** fought for the top spot, with the hedgehog currently leaning on the top spot for now. On Christmas, we got 4 newcomers, with mixed results. ***Nosferatu*** delivered a fantastic debut and became Robert Eggers' highest grossing film in just 5 days, while ***A Complete Unknown*** had a very solid start. On the other hand, ***Babygirl*** had a soft start, while ***The Fire Inside*** failed to attract interest.

The Top 10 earned a combined $159.2 million this weekend. That's up a huge 58% from last year, when ***Wonka*** returned to the top spot.

Staying on top, ***Sonic 3*** earned $38 million this weekend ($59.9 million five-day). That represents a 37% drop, which is better than the previous films. There were concerns over the weekdays, as it appeared that it was front-loaded and would show weak legs, but it looks like it recovered for now.

Through ten days, the film has amassed $136.8 million. It should have another great hold this weekend, which will allow it to hit $200 million very soon. It can go as high as $250 million at this pace.

Settling for second place, ***Mufasa*** made $37.1 million this weekend ($63.7 million five-day). That's a very nice 5% increase from last weekend. It had a soft debut but it's showing some strength. Through 10 days, it has made $113.4 million. Despite this increase, the film is still off a massive 68% from the 2019 film through the same point. We'll see how much it can earn through the holidays.

Exceeding expectations, Robert Eggers' ***Nosferatu*** debuted with a fantastic $21.1 million this weekend ($40.3 million five-day). This is not just Eggers' biggest debut by a wide margin, but it's already his highest grossing film domestically, passing ***The Northman*** ($34.2 million). It's also the fourth biggest debut for Focus Features.

This is an amazing result in any sense of the word, and showed that Eggers could finally hit the mainstream audience (***The Northman*** was supposed to be that film, but it didn't quite land at the box office). But that still raises the question: how was this film able to debut this high and far above Eggers' films? Credit must go to a fantastic marketing campaign, which offered enough intrigue and darkness to attract audiences. The decision to hide Bill Skarsgård's appearance as the iconic Count Orlok from the trailers panned out very well; if you want to watch him, you have to pay a ticket.

It can be said that Eggers' brand has also increased in past years. While ***The Northman*** wasn't a box office hit, Focus Features confirmed that the film eventually became profitable after a few months thanks to strong VOD numbers and other post-theatrical markets, and this was a big reason why they were confident in greenlighting ***Nosferatu***. Also, while remaking a 1922 silent German Expressionist film feels like it would struggle to get recognition, ***Nosferatu*** actually had some exposure to the audience. A lot of kids were introduced to this character in that iconic ***SpongeBob SquarePants*** episode. That helped the film build awareness. 

According to Focus Features, 55% of the audience was male and 56% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. While critics raved about the film, audiences wasn't as much; they gave it a weak ""B–"" on CinemaScore. That's not actually a bad score for a horror film, given they often fall in the C range. Nevertheless, without horror competition till ***Wolf Man*** in mid January, ***Nosferatu*** should hold well through the holidays. While it's unclear how much it can earn, one thing is clear: this is hitting $100 million domestically, which is an amazing result.

***Wicked*** rose 37%, adding $19.4 million this weekend ($31.7 million five-day). On Christmas day, it added a sing-along version, which boosted the numbers. The film has earned a fantastic $424 million so far.

After its weak legs, ***Moana 2*** had its best drop so far. It jumped 38%, adding $18.2 million this weekend. A much needed recovery, given it wasn't holding well after its gigantic opening. The film has earned $394.6 million so far, and will hit the $400 million milestone in a few days.

Debuting in sixth place, Searchlight's ***A Complete Unknown*** earned $11.6 million ($23.1 million five-day). This is one of the best debuts for Searchlight, and its opening day ($7.2 million) was a record for the studio. If we want to compare it to James Mangold's films, the five-day debut is slightly above of what ***Walk the Line*** made in 3 days ($22.3 million). 

This is a solid start, and the only reason why it's not fantastic is that it's carrying an extensive $60-$70 million budget, putting a lot of pressure in the film. Bob Dylan is one of the most iconic singers and songwriters of the past century, although he is still not as popular as other musicians in other biopics. For example, Queen, Elton John and Bob Marley are more popular with current audiences than Dylan. So the film had only one selling point: its star Timothée Chalamet.

Like him or not, Chalamet is one of the most popular young stars of our times. He already had huge hits in the past year with ***Wonka*** and ***Dune: Part Two***, and he's already set for another film, ***Marty Supreme***, which also opens on Christmas Day next year. Deadline reported that 36% of the audience watched the film for Chalamet, cementing a status as a box office draw. Reviews were also solid enough to win over audiences, and some Oscar buzz is on the horizon.

According to Searchlight, the audience was equally split between men and women. Unsurprisingly, the big demo was adults; 62% of the audience was 35 and over. They gave it a strong ""A"" on CinemaScore, which bodes very well for its legs. And you have to remember that this is targeting an old audience, which doesn't rush out to watch a film as soon as possible. We'll keep an eye on this one, but the incoming Oscar buzz should help it stay in theaters for quite  a long time.

In a distant seventh place, A24's ***Babygirl*** earned $4.3 million ($7.2 million five-day). That's quite a soft start, especially considering that the film was playing in 2,115 theaters, and the fact that A24 pushed it as its main attraction for the holidays.

The film is sold as an erotic thriller, but that can be a mixed bag at the box office. Outside the ***Fifty Shades of Grey***, erotic thrillers haven't performed very well at the box office. And despite having a big name in Nicole Kidman, she hasn't had a good run as of late; she hasn't had a single box office hit since ***The Upside*** back in 2019. Her recent success has been on streaming and on TV, leaving questions over her star power at the box office (even though she's the face of AMC).

According to A24, 53% of the audience was female and 44% of the audience was 35 and over. While critics were positive of the film, the audience wasn't forgiving; they gave it a very weak ""B–"" on CinemaScore, which might be due to the nature of the film itself. While Kidman has some Oscar buzz, it would be a surprise if the film made anything above $20 million domestically.

***Gladiator II*** continues showing some great late legs. The film eased just 9% and earned $4.1 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $163 million. It's gonna head to around $175 million.

Angel Studios' ***Homestead*** had the worst drop in the Top 10. It dropped 47%, adding $3.1 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $12.8 million, and it suggests that it will fall off when the holidays are over.

Rounding up the Top 10 was the last newcomer of the week, Amazon MGM's ***The Fire Inside***. Despite setting it at 2,006 theaters, the film bombed with just $2 million ($4.3 million five-day). That's the 28th worst debut for any film playing at 2,000+ theaters.

This isn't a surprising result. Amazon didn't appear to focus on properly marketing the film, choosing to simply dump it on Christmas and hoping that it would find an audience. After all, ***The Boys in the Boat*** over-performed last year, showing there was a market for sports dramas. But the film simply lacked a hook; people simply weren't interested in Claressa Shields' story. Even with the talent involved, it simply wasn't enough.

According to MGM, 51% of the audience was female and 51% was 35 and over. On the bright side, the audience gave it a strong ""A"" on CinemaScore, which fits nicely with its great reviews. But even with that, it's unlikely it can turn things around.

***Kraven the Hunter*** slightly recovered after its awful second weekend drop, even if it fell on the bad side of the drops. It dropped 44%, adding $1.7 million this weekend. Sadly, with an anemic $21.3 million domestic total so far, there's nothing to celebrate here. It might hit $25 million, but it won't get much higher than that.

But while ***Kraven*** kept showing weak legs, ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** does not appear to have any legs. The film collapsed 63%, earning just $455,000 this weekend. Absolutely horrible considering the rest of the films had fantastic holds. The film has made just $8.5 million domestically, and it's now guaranteed to finish below $10 million.

Paramount chose to open the Robbie Williams biopic ***Better Man*** in 6 theaters, ahead of its wide release on January 10. But the film flopped with just $18,000 ($35,000 five-day), which translates to a very poor $3,000 per-theater average. Not a surprise, considering Williams failed to find an audience in America. This is a bad sign for its wide release.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Mufasa*** was still on top in the rest of the world, albeit only slightly. It added $77 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $327 million. The best markets currently are France ($20.9M), UK ($15.8M), Mexico ($15.5M), Italy ($14.4M) and Germany ($13.6M).

***Sonic 3*** made its debut in the rest of the world, debuting with a dazzling $74 million in 52 markets, taking its worldwide total to $210 million. That's a huge 83% of the second film's debut. The best debuts were the UK ($15.1M), Mexico ($10.3M), France ($7.3M), Australia ($5.5M), Germany ($5.5M), Spain ($3.3M), Panama ($2.3M); Peru ($1.6M), Colombia ($1.3M) and Malaysia ($1.3M), all of which were records for the franchise. It should have no problem hitting $500 million, and it still has some markets left.

***Moana 2*** added $36 million this weekend, and its worldwide total is now $882 million. The best markets are France ($53.9M), UK ($42.6M), Germany ($34.8M), Mexico ($28.2M) and Brazil ($25.7M).

In a major milestone, ***Wicked*** has now passed ***Mamma Mia!*** to become the highest grossing Broadway adaptation, with a current worldwide total of $634 million. The best markets are the UK ($67M), Australia ($24.8M), Korea ($14.2M), Germany ($11.8M) and Mexico ($9.9M).

dune2,dune part two,1jza4m5,Movies With Significant Preemptive Opposition,"**Can anyone share a movie (or movies) that, before even hitting theaters, had a truly dedicated group of haters?** It doesn't matter if the reasons for the hate were good or bad. I know there have been quite a few of them—but I'd just love to hear more examples. Ideally, I'm looking for high-budget films, but small films are great too too (because I suspect there are more of them—the ones I can think of most easily are pretty small).

***Update: Wow I'm getting a lot of downvotes for asking this  ... I'm not really sure why? Oh well.***

**Background** (Don't Have to Read Any of This—Just for the Curious)

>!I'm a fan of comic book movies, so something I've seen quite a bit on my feed lately has been strong fans of Zach Snyder's DC offerings being, I would say (they might disagree!), super critical of what we've seen from **James Gunn's** ***Superman***. And, recently, we saw ***Snow White*** have an immense amount of opposition prior to its opening—to be clear, I have seen the film and it's not great, not saying it is ... but regardless of its quality, I think it's fair to say the review-bombing campaign and pre-opening opposition has been pretty well documented. I'm a bit fascinated by the phenomenon. **Part of me wonders if, especially in today's age where people often enjoy cultivating fandoms by sharing their love/hate of a film on social media, such an intense group of critics will change how general audiences perceive the film.** (To be clear: My guess is, it won't ... unless you get a situation like a Twitter mob jumping all over positive posts or having negative posts go viral very frequently. **In short: I'd love to hear about any sort of films that were loudly hated on pre-opening, for good or bad reasons.** (A bit before my time, but I think ***Twilight Zone***, for example, was controversial when it came out given that a helicopter pilot, an actor, and two very young child actresses died during the filmmaking—now acknowledged to be at least in part due to negligence on the part of the filmmakers.)!<",0,17,1744664971.0,2025-04-14 22:09:31,False
dune2,dune part two,1jyhy72,"Amateur Review: Sinister Switch, a.k.a. Daughter in Disguise","A couple who separated after being unable to get over their daughter's disappearance six years ago receive an unexpected phone call from the police one snowy day: their daughter has arrived at the police station, claiming to have been kidnapped by a crazed hermit. Shocked but hopeful, they welcome her into the mother's home, believing without question that she is their daughter.

She's not. The kidnapping part is true - in fact, the kidnapper took at least six girls, and she really did escape from his remote compound somewhere in a signal deadzone - but she's an unrelated girl who was friends with their real daughter and wanted to take the chance to get the loving family she never got to have.

But in the time between the gutwrenching opening and the subdued but cathartic ending, that's between us and her. Instead, the audience is treated to bittersweet scenes of distraught parents trying to get their quiet, traumatised ""daughter"" to open up to them and the girl trying in vain to keep the snowballing lie that she is someone she's not going until even the parents get suspicious and the mother forces her to tell the truth. These are heartfelt, tense and domestic in the best way, but anyone who's seen a Lifetime/Reel One/MarVista movie and is just here to watch a young actress ham it up while murdering her way through the supporting cast will be disappointed, because nobody dies in this, not even the villain himself.

Mother Kristen (Emily Alatalo) and father Justin (Steve Belford) are believable as characters and have good chemistry together; however, their roles in the story are not created equal. In a pretty familiar trope for this ""sub-genre"" of made-for-TV movies, the mom is the one who gets to lead the attack on the isolated farm (or whatever it's meant to be) while the dad is effectively abandoned at home and plays no part in rescuing his daughter. (Though at least he avoids the ignominy of being kidnapped, evil and in on it or killed like what happens to a lot of other dads and husbands in these movies.) But the real reason to see this movie is Natalie Jane as, er, Natalie \[Insert Name Here\], the girl who tries to take the place of Olivia (the real Olivia is played by Nicole Volossetski, if you cared) after her escape. She conveys a subtle air of menace in certain scenes convincingly, but it never takes long for her to revert back to what she really is underneath: a lonely, broken, emotionally traumatised girl desperate to be loved. As such, you end up rooting for her to get what she wants even if you also want the other girls to be rescued. And she does, after a fashion, but I'll get to that in a minute.

Nobody else is particularly relevant or memorable. Olivia's friend Beth shows up for like five minutes max to cast suspicion on Natalie, get beaten up for it offscreen and vanish from the movie afterwards. Tonjha Richardson has a bit-and-a-half part as Dectective Simmons, the obligitory cop-who-fails-to-do-anything part who doesn't even try to verify ""Olivia's"" identity but gets to be on the news announcing the outcome of the ending. Apart from Preeti Dhanda as Kristen's friend and colleague Anne, the only other halfway-notable name in the cast is Adrian Falconer as the kidnapper, John Something. He's memorable and loathsome enough that I was glad when he got his face mashed in with a shovel, but we get little to no answers for why he kidnaps young girls, how he takes care of them or even what his day job is that he thinks can provide for six mouths to feed and himself. He's such a non-factor that unlike most Lifetime villains who are constant presences in the story, he doesn't appear properly until the last ten minutes.

But that leads us to the ending. So, after the reunion between Kristen and the real Olivia and the three of them doing an impromptu teamup with Natalie to take down John the Creep, they escape the compound and call in the site of the kidnapping. The movie then cuts to one year later, revealing that despite having some bad dreams, Olivia is back with her parents and Kristen and Justin have mended their marriage. Also, because her birth parents are unknown apparently even to her kidnapper, Natalie has been adopted into their family. I'm sure some people who watched it might groan at this depending on how sympathetic they find her, but they should save those groans for the cheesetacular reveal that Kristen has written her own autobiographical novel about the events of the movie, with the corntastic title of ""One Daughter Lost, Two Daughters Found"", to be published by the publishing company she works for in an uspecified role. Other than that, I loved it.

Final Verdict: While this movie is burdened with a lot of the same tropes and eye-rolling plot developments people have seen in countless other movies like this, I'd argue you can do much worse, and at least you won't be bored watching it. 7/10.",0,0,1744578084.0,2025-04-13 22:01:24,False
dune2,dune part two,1jxvqxf,The Back to the Future Trilogy. The perfect trilogy.,"Today is day two of a three day BTTF rewatch. Yesterday i watched BTTF, i've just finished watching BTTF 2 and tomorrow i'll watch 3.

I have seen all three films multiple times, I have read and watched all sorts of behind the scenes trivia and details about them. I know these films and yet they, especially 2, are flawless. I know what to look for, the subtle clues that all is not as it seems and even knowing what i'm looking at and where I still either don't notice or it's not distracting.

For example i know at some point Marty appears to have three hands, i didn't notice as I was so engrossed in the film I forgot to look.

The dinner scene is still my favourite scene, it is so perfect, you have three copies of Michael J. Fox interacting around the same table and even knowing that and seeing the scene multiple times over pretty much all my life I still find it utterly perfect. As a young child I didn't realise Marlene was also played by Michael J. Fox, i thought they got an actress in. I realised later on though, possibly the third or fourth time I watched it,

There is a scene just as they arrive back in 1985 and the car lands and turns into a driveway, in real life this is a model landing then the lamppost is used to cover up the transition between model and real car yet it is superb, i have watched the scene many times and yet its perfect, it is so smooth. [See it here](https://youtu.be/rhNDsPMaK_A?t=454) I have watched it frame by frame and it's still flawless. 

Then there are the plot threads, there are no loose ends, it just all works, there are elements used from the first film and in 2 there are setups for scenes in 3. Everything is neat, Well apart from the second car in the third film but i'm sure the lack of spare parts for a DeLorean in the 1950s stopped them from cannibalising it for parts, it's mostly just an educated guess though.

I love the first film, I do, the little changes in the 1980s setup in the 1950s are really quite nice and they add much to a rewatch. Like I said though, the second film is the best, utterly amazing, some of the effects are a bit dated but so are the effects in Jason and the Argonauts and I still watch that. I'm not going to criticise any old film for dated effects, it's not like they had access to modern tech.

Anyway if, for some bizarre reason, you have not seen these films go and watch them.",87,41,1744505060.0,2025-04-13 01:44:20,False
dune2,dune part two,1jwm0w4,Pirates 1 (2003) or The Mummy (1999)?,"Both are two of my favourite films of all time. 

But idk, for me, as much as I love The Mummy, there’s something about that first Pirates film. I think it has a better distribution of characters. The world feels more lived in, and grimey. You can feel Gore Verbinski’s style more than you can feel Stephen Summers. And the world feels a bit more well realised and dense. I think part of it is because there’s like 4 years difference between them and there was a lot of leaps in terms of blockbusters in that time. 

I rewatched The Mummy two nights ago. Brendan is just incredible. He doesn’t get his flowers enough for how charming he is as O Connell. The suspense is built up well, and the effects while dated, are still great. I think the one thing it’s missing is the dread and scale I want to feel. It’s more streamlined and family friendly? Still give it a 9/10, which is a relatively rare score for me.

I will say tho, I enjoy The Mummy Returns marginally more than Pirates 2 and 3. I really love the first two acts of Returns and I think it’s only brought down by the very meh 3rd act. 

My favourite adventure/mystery piece of Media is easily Uncharted 2. But followed fairly closely by Pirates 1 then The Mummy. ",0,23,1744364931.0,2025-04-11 10:48:51,False

Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen star in the first movie, but don't return for *King of the Monsters.* Ken Watanabe does, but *only* for that movie. Kyle Chandler and Millie Bobby Brown carry over from KotM to *Godzilla vs Kong,* but don't return for Godzilla x Kong.

Basically, every third movie, it's just an entirely different group of people, excepting Kong and Godzilla themselves.

dune2,dune part two,1jtuoqr,How a friendly grandmother's daily walks indirectly gave WALL-E its voice,"In the fall of 2004, I had just moved 2000 miles to northern California to start my new job in the animation industry. Each weekend, I would visit my grandmother who lived in Marin county and spend the day with her. My grandmother was an amazing woman, she was the type who kept detailed notes of all your preferences so she could provide the best experiences for her guests. For example, each time I visited, she had made my favorite sandwich with the exact proportions of condiments and meats I preferred with absolutely no tomatoes anywhere nearby, purchased my favorite soda (she would never keep soda in her own fridge as she did not like it, so she always bough one fresh the day I visited), and have a selection of candies I liked (or at least which she remember I liked from when I was 5). One of our favorite things to do together was walk through her neighborhood and talk with her neighbors. My grandmother lived in her neighborhood for nearly 30 years, and her husband had lived there for 80 years, so between them they knew the history of every house and of her friends inside. She walked her neighborhood every day, and each time she saw someone outside of their house she would stop and talk with them. If she knew someone’s daily schedule she would time her walks so that she would see them outside and conveniently have their favorite cookies with her to give to them. Each weekend, my grandmother and I would walk the one mile loop and she gave me updates on all her neighbors, which numbered at least 30 families. As we passed each house, she’d tell me whose kids just got into college, who changed jobs, the successes of each kid, their favorite foods and movies, etc. She was like a living newsletter, and I loved hearing my grandmother excitedly tell each story. 


One day during our walk, she was giving me the latest scoop on her neighbor Ben, a kind man with a wonderful wife and lovely young daughter, who creates sounds for movies. As we approached Ben’s house, a car pulled into his driveway directly in front of us and a man in his 50s stepped out. “Oh, hey, that’s Ben,” she said, waving to him as he walked to open his passenger-side door. He turned to us, smiled, said “hi”, and as he opened his passenger-side door, out tumbled his laptop, crashing onto the concrete with the screen still open. He shouted a boomer-sanitized expletive and I instinctively rushed over to help him pick it up. As I did, I glanced at the screen.

What I saw stopped me in my tracks: two figures were battling with glowing swords over a river of lava. I immediately recognized it as the ending duel from *Episode III: Revenge of the Sith*. Now, this was September 2004 and that movie wasn’t due out until May 2005. This was the biggest movie everyone was talking about and counting down to. Fans knew that the end of the movie was supposed to be a climatic duel between Obi-wan and Anakin on the lava planet of Mustafar which leads to the creation of Darth Vader as we know him, but everyone was guessing how it would happen. Any hint of leaks were highly valued and reported on sites like Ain’t It Cool News, Dark Horizons, and ComingSoon.net. A modern equivalent would be to unknowingly stumble upon the “On your left” portals scene from Avengers Endgame 8 months before it came out. And here I was, staring at the scene I had been imagining ever since I read about Darth Vader’s origins nearly two decades earlier.


That’s when I realized that “Ben” wasn’t just any neighbor. He was [*Ben Burtt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Burtt), the legendary sound designer behind the *Star Wars* and *Indiana Jones* franchises. He created the sounds of lightsabers, R2-D2’s beeps, Indy’s whip, Darth Vader’s breathing, and even secretly inserted the “[Wilhelm scream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YDpuA90KEY)” into his movies which led to its modern popularity. He shaped the audio landscape of every major Lucasfilm movie and show for decades. But to my grandmother, who hadn’t watched any of those films, he was just “Ben”, the friendly neighbor with a lovely wife and daughter. 


I gasped, “Holy cow, that’s *Episode III*,” and Ben quickly shut the laptop and tried to do a Jedi mind trick of telling us it was not what we thought it was. I backed off, understanding the sensitivity of what I'd seen and how his literal job was at stake. My grandmother, ever the social butterfly, then introduced us properly, and we got to talking. I mentioned that I just started working in the industry and we shared stories. Ben invited us inside, introduced us to his wife and daughter, and even showed us his [Oscars](https://postimg.cc/yWW7D52w). After a pleasant visit, we thanked him and continued on our neighborhood loop. I was over the moon about the experience, and my grandmother was just happy to have been able to talk to her friends, and to see me happy too. 


At the start of the story I mentioned I had just started working in the animation industry. Well, that was somewhat burying the lede, because the next part is how we get to Wall-E:


At that time, I was working at Pixar Animation Studios on the movie which would eventually become *Ratatouille*. But that movie was still years away, instead, Pixar’s next movie, *The Incredibles*, was about to release in a couple weeks. Soon after my interaction with Ben, Pixar held the “[Cast and Crew](https://postimg.cc/f3BhLjCz)” screening of *The Incredibles* where all the people who worked on the film [came together](https://postimg.cc/gX7Fyz11) and watched the final product. Along with all the artists and developers, the voice cast was there, as were [Steve Jobs, Ed Catmull, John Lasseter, and Brad Bird](https://postimg.cc/pmMv1dyH). The movie played to thunderous applause, and people cheered when [ahem] *incredibly* difficult technical scenes were shown, such as when Mr. Incredible arrives on the island via an underwater path and all the water drains from the hangar.

At the end of the crew screening, John Lasseter announced that “Friends and Family screenings would begin in two weeks”. These were preview screenings shown at the Pixar building where the crew could invite anyone to see the movie weeks before it came out. I remembered Ben’s daughter was really excited about The Incredibles, so on my next walk with my grandmother we went to his house where I invited his family to join the “Friends and Family” screening.


The day of the friends screening [arrived](https://postimg.cc/DmDnL6Tm) and I met Ben and his family at the [Emeryville studio](https://postimg.cc/K17bXygg). Before the movie started I gave them a tour of all the areas which guests were allowed to visit and showed them all [*The Incredibles* art](https://postimg.cc/SXyhktW1) and decor adorning the walls (Pixar always redecorates its buildings with art and [full-size statues](https://postimg.cc/1nX1Nn7p) from their next release). When it came time for the movie to start we shuffled into the theater, performed the “oohs” and “aahs” as the pre-show shooting stars appeared on the theater ceiling (a Pixar tradition), and then watched the movie. Spoiler alert: Ben’s daughter loved it, as did everyone else. There is just something magical about seeing a movie in the building where it was created and surrounded by the creators. 


After the credits finished rolling (never leave before the credits at these screenings), I walked with Ben to introduce him to a few of my coworkers. One of them was the late, great [Ralph Eggleston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Eggleston), a Pixar veteran who had joined the studio for *Toy Story* and touched everything after. When I had first met Ralph he was also working on the *not-yet-titled-little-chef* film, but soon he moved to a top-secret project which was coming out after that one. With the Pixar-Disney partnership ending after *Cars*, all work on later movies was kept under strict wraps, especially from Disney-affiliated people to avoid a Bug’s Life/Antz fiasco once Pixar broke free from Disney (note: Disney ended up not renewing the partnership with Pixar and instead flat-out bought them, many artists' tears were shed). The only thing I knew about Ralph’s project was it had something to do with space based on the cryptic images on his office door. Ralph and I had bonded earlier on *Ratatouille* as we had both grown up in the deep South in relatively small towns and were shocked that we ended up making major movies in CA, although his resume at that time was far, far more impressive than my single, unreleased movie. 


When I introduced Ralph to Ben, Ralph immediately recognized the name and geeked out over his *Star Wars* credentials. I shouldn’t have been surprised, Pixar, and animation/game studios in general, are full of *Star Wars* fans who know every bit of geeky minutia about the series and recognize obscure names who worked on the films (myself included, hence the origin of this story). As Ralph is geeking out, he tells Ben he is working on a project right up his alley. Ralph then waved someone over from across the room. That someone turned out to be [John Lasseter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lasseter), founding member and chief creative officer at Pixar. 


I don’t know John Lasseter. I had never truly met John Lasseter at that time. Technically he addressed me when he spoke to the audience at the ""Cast and Crew"" screening. And I once walked past him in a nearly empty hallway and he vaguely nodded at me in acknowledgment. Yet suddenly I was in a 4-way discussion with him about a project no one could really talk about due to Disney’s spies being everywhere. *Star Wars* geekiness was shared, comments that “we’ll be in touch” were floated, and soon Ben and I were on our own and I had no idea what had just happened. We met up with Ben’s family, listened to more excitement from his daughter about the movie, and eventually parted ways.


Over the following months Ben and I kept in touch, mostly through my grandmother and our walks. She proudly told all her neighbors that Ben had visited her grandson’s workplace, and that he’d had a wonderful time. A few months later, *Episode III* came out. It was a hit, the final lightsaber battle was incredible, and I made a point to stop by Ben’s house and congratulate him on his amazing work. We finally were able to talk about the fight scene which I “did not see what I thought I saw” months before.


I kept working at Pixar for a while, eventually moving off of *Ratatouille* and Pixar in general just before the Jan Pinkava/Brad Bird transition. I saw Ben less often, but my grandmother kept in touch with him during her walks. I learned through her that he was soon possibly going to work at Pixar and I was curious what he could be working on. The one time I asked he was cagey about it, doing another Jedi mind trick that it wasn’t what I thought it was.

 
Years later, I’m watching a futuristic film set in a post-human world filled with trash, cockroaches, and a single robot. Twenty minutes into the film, the title character, WALL-E, upon meeting the sleek EVE robot, mispronounces her name as “Ev-a” with a technical flare. And once again, Ben Burtt’s hard work was causing me to fall in love with these inanimate objects through their various beeps and other electronic noises. 


Sadly, my grandmother passed away a few years later, around the same time I completely left the animation industry. I fell out of touch with most of my Pixar and ILM contacts from that time. But when I think back on my grandmother I smile knowing about her unexpected contribution to the film industry. Now, I know the film industry is a relatively small, close-knit industry. If someone is making a robot film and they need someone to create voices for those robots then Ben Burtt is the top person on the list. He would have ended up on WALL-E no matter what. But I like to think that in this timeline, my grandmother’s penchant for talking to all her neighbors during her walks indirectly led to WALL-E and EVE getting their voices.

TLDR; OPs grandmother walks her neighborhood every day and is friends with her neighbor ""Ben"". During a shared walk, OP meets Ben and realizes he is Ben Burtt, sound designer for all Star Wars films. OP invites Ben to a Pixar screening of The Incredibles and they meet the people who are making WALL-E. Ben is hired by Pixar for WALL-E years later.",71,6,1744055905.0,2025-04-07 20:58:25,False
dune2,dune part two,1jtchj2,"House of Flying Daggers, am I missing something?","I have a feeling I'm going to get a lot of hate for this one, but please know this all comes from a place of love for the wuxia genre and Zhang Yimou's work.

Tonight I realized for some reason I had never watched House of Flying Daggers and I decided to fix that. Two hours later and I'm... confused? Unimpressed? It really seems to me like this is probably the worst famous wuxia movie, certainly when compared to the likes of Hero and CTHD. Why is it so beloved?

Firstly, I do understand the theme of ""personal tragedy overshadowing the fate of nations in the eyes of those involved"", and I appreciate how the movie tries to pull us close to the biased, internal point of view so that we might forget the war brewing and focus on the personal drama. Unfortunately, I find that the characters we're supposed to care for are just terrible people and very uncompelling.

We are introduced to Jin and five minutes in he's shown as a drunken lout who's trying to sexually assault a woman. This creates a bad impression even though we later realize it's part of the plan to... gain her trust? What? And it works? She actually falls in love? And then later, when she's reading him, she even says ""you can hold your drink well"", which means she realizes he wasn't even that drunk when he was doing it. 

At this point I was very confused.

Captain Leo is instantly more likable as he's shown as composed, competent and cunning which, paired with Andy Lau's great performance, made his scenes very enjoyable. 

The movie then pushes hard on the blossoming relationship and inner conflict of the two protagonists, and while it does feel weird, and their chemistry unearned, it was interesting enough to keep me watching.

Then the big reveal of Mei being the one conning Jin and not the other way around. At this point I started to really like the movie and everything made sense. She was just pretending to fall in love with the guy who tried to drunkenly assault her. Ah! Back in the game! Leo's revealed to be a mole and the whole plan was to bait the unnamed, invisible general! All right! We have an antagonist!

But wait, what? How was any of this necessary to bait the general? What's the point of introducing Jin, an unknown quantity, if they knew Mei was going back to the Flying Daggers? What's the point of all the deaths? Why not just have the general's men follow her?

And wait, I assumed Leo's plan WAS to make Jin fall in love with her and defect. Why else would he choose his emotional, womanizing, good looking subordinate who spends the first half of the movie talking about how he loves to flirt? But now it's revealed that he didn't want this to happen? I was waiting for the big reveal that he was trying to bait the general AND recruit a new competent warrior to the cause but no, he chose the guy who had the two qualities he didn't want for a sacrificial pawn: being a good warrior and cuckholding him.

Then Mei's character... I really did not like her. When taken moment by moment she seems cunning and loyal but if you analyze the movie altogether, well, she literally betrays everything and everyone.

She betrays Jin of course, since that's the plan. Then she betrays her lover, the man who saved her life many times AND sacrificed three years for her. And I think, well, she must be very devoted to her cause. But no, in the end she betrays the Flying Daggers too and tries to run away with Jin. Which quality does she possess, then, that we're supposed to respect or appreciate in any way?

And in the end the drama destroys all these characters and the overarching Flying Daggers plotline is completely dropped. Again, I realize this is part of the themes of individuals being more important than nations, but... the individuals in questions are shown to be petty and devoid of virtue at every turn. They are ultimately all selfish, mediocre people. Is the life of a petty man truly more important then the fate of a nation, then?

Finally, since this is in fact a wuxia, I have to comment on the visuals. Some scenes are masterfully shot, like the bamboo forest fight. Sound design and visuals both on point. However... that's kind of it. Compared to Hero and CTHD, both breathtaking masterpieces in their visual achievements, this one seems very subdued, unaided by direction that's sometimes clumsy, with dirty cuts and very few long shots. The choreography, too, is mostly lackluster apart from a couple of instances. 

Again, I must stress the fact the direction has no confidence in the actors' ability to portray combat. The fights contain many cuts, there's very little wire-work and the swordplay is serviceable at best, portraying many slashes aimed at the empty space between the actors, for example. Still leagues ahead of western cinema, of course, but also leagues behind what's portrayed in true masterpieces of the genre.

In conclusion I ask you this: why do you think this movie earns the right to be cited among those genre-defining masterpieces that brought wuxia to the west? Is it just the fact it came out at a time when there was demand for this type of movie or does it stand on its own? If you think this is indeed a masterpiece, what have I missed? 

Please try to be respectful, I am actually interested in having a meaningful conversation over this matter since wuxia movies are very dear to me.",0,12,1743998317.0,2025-04-07 04:58:37,False

>While many bad films are made with love, sequels, spinoffs and big-budget adaptations often make the artform feel inert because they are produced with so little heart that they might as well have been generated by AI. But here's the thing: I actually liked *A Minecraft Movie*. I'm as surprised as you are. This is not a disaster. Not by a mile. In fact, for most of its duration, it's downright charming and, in parts, had me laughing out loud.

[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review-jason-momoa-jack-black-1236352502/)

>Watching “A Minecraft Movie,” we’re always aware that the story is something that’s been grafted onto the world, and that we don’t have much of a dramatic stake in it — that it’s just the film’s way of cobbling together something that “works.” (Which, in its way, is very Minecraft.) Some of this is amusing, but like the rest of “A Minecraft Movie” it never feels like it matters. Yet it’s no insult to say that, in this case, that’s actually true to the spirit of a video game that turns life into a blockhead version of itself.

[The Hollywood Reporter - Lovia Gyrakye](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review-jason-momoa-jack-black-1236179043/)

>The most disappointing aspect of *A Minecraft Movie*, directed by the husband-wife duo who go by Jared Hess (*Napoleon Dynamite*, *Nacho Libre*), isn’t that it’s born out of an existing IP. We live in a world of low-effort reboots, unnecessary remakes and movies operating as extensions of corporate brands. Another one of these gluttonous projects is hardly surprising. What makes *A Minecraft Movie* so dispiriting is how it fails to spark the imagination, betraying a core tenet of the game on which it’s based. 

[The Wrap - Michael Ordona](https://www.thewrap.com/minecraft-movie-review-jason-momoa-jack-black/)

>The most accurate summation of “A Minecraft Movie” is probably “It is what it is.” It’s what it’s supposed to be. It probably won’t dig up many new converts to the game, but should strike box-office silver, at least. (And fans, be sure to stick around for two credits scenes – especially the second one.)

>It’s a real credit to Black’s irrepressibly unique comic energy that “A Minecraft Movie” never feels quite as hypocritical as it should. Either disastrously ill-suited for its message about how money is the enemy of joy, or immaculately *well*\-suited for its message about much harder it is to build things than it is to destroy them, Hess’ film can’t help but feel like its very existence is an affront to the creative freedom that has allowed “Minecraft” to become such a vital form of self-exploration for kids around the world (even Warner Bros.’ choice to call it “A Minecraft Movie\*”\* as opposed to “The Minecraft Movie” implies a spectrum of different concepts, despite the reality of a business that can only imagine this one). But Black — whatever his charms, and regardless of how well they’re deployed here — is a living testament to the idea that people can still thrive by staying true to their own expression. If not in this world, then perhaps in one of their own design.

>For a big-studio adaptation of a massively popular video-game, A Minecraft Movie lets a surprising amount of its director’s personality shine through. Napoleon Dynamite’s Jared Hess manages to fit some laugh-out-loud silliness into his Overworld saga before surrendering to the obligations of CG-driven fantasy adventure. Thematically, A Minecraft Movie offers a pat world-is-what-you-make-it lesson, but Jack Black and Jason Momoa in particular sell it with a lot of comic enthusiasm.

[AV Club - Jacob Oller](https://www.avclub.com/a-minecraft-movie-review)

>One could rightfully question pretty much all of *A Minecraft Movie*, a formulaic template ornamented with surrealism. Some moments bear the scribbled signature of a filmmaker with offbeat passions. These are quickly plastered over by the hotel artwork of a four-quadrant IP extravaganza—and even the by-the-numbers sequences seem jumbled, out of order, or repeated. Yet, there’s something fitting about this film’s contradictions. *Minecraft* is fertile ground for innovation and exploitation. It’s adaptable, limited mostly by those playing it. One can build something personal, copy something mass produced, or attempt to tweak one with the other. Those behind *A Minecraft Movie* saw infinite possibilities laid out before them and—unlike another adaptation of a popular building pastime, *The Lego Movie*—opted for the one that’s been made a thousand times before.

>Your noggin will certainly be done in by Steve and Garrett (Momoa) flying through the air in a risque position suggesting a sex act. Really, “A Minecraft Movie” a 101-minute lobotomy. Put that on the poster. For the uninitiated, the Overworld — I’m pretty sure — is a pixelated place where a player can erect buildings, create tools and design weapons out of blocks. The rules are unclear, as the filmmakers picked silliness over storytelling. Stacking cubes would not, at first glance, seem like a strong plot to hang an action-adventure film on, however “The Lego Movie” did so with cleverness, heart and humor. Trust me: “The Lego Movie” is “Lawrence of Arabia” next to “Minecraft.”

>There’s a world where “A Minecraft Movie” actually backs the idealism of creativity, which it so proudly boasts in its barebones story. Maybe if the film were animated, it could’ve played far better to the concept of endless possibilities and allowed for a far more visually dazzling spectacle. Inherently, maybe it would never even be possible, as the idea of creativity can only be celebrated as little as possible when it’s given the parameters of being in such a lazy ip scrape of the barrel as this. There used to be a time when a majority of children’s films were made with such care and intention. Now it seems all you need is buzzwords, celebrities, and “Avengers: Endgame” clap-inducing moments, all of which “A Minecraft Movie” has, unlike a soul, which at least the game feels like it possesses.

>So sloppy is *A Minecraft Movie* that it can’t keep track of its various concerns, highlighted by a mirthless subplot—in which Jennifer Coolidge’s vice principal picks up and woos an Overworld resident who’s traveled to our universe—that it basically drops around the midway point. Buried deep within Hess’ wannabe blockbuster is a message about how creativity is cool and, thus, so too are outcasts. Yet nothing about this hodgepodge fits together. *Minecraft* enthusiasts will be pleased by the film’s various nods to its multiplatform predecessor. Nonetheless, shouting out isn’t the same thing as faithfully celebrating and translating, and those with no experience assembling towers, villages, and weapons in Mojang Studios’ sandbox will undoubtedly find it all scattershot and wearisome. It’s proof that you can build it, but that doesn’t mean anyone—much less newbies—will come.",1324,1195,1743620357.0,2025-04-02 19:59:17,False

'The Chosen' and 'The Woman in the Yard' had decent debuts, but 'Death of a Unicorn' flopped with just $5.7 million.","https://preview.redd.it/1vs90px2d3se1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2ebc5ef1c093da9fe4611c8661655c971899f16

A $270 million movie couldn't win against Jason Statham.

***A Working Man*** over-performed projections and managed to steal the #1 spot, marking another win for Jason Statham. That was at the cost of ***Snow White***'s second weekend, which had a horrible drop amidst negative buzz and word of mouth. The rest of the newcomers was a mixed bag; ***The Chosen*** had a fantastic debut, ***The Woman in the Yard*** did okay, while ***Death of a Unicorn*** flopped.

The Top 10 earned a combined $68.4 million this weekend. That's off a poor 47.3% from last year, when ***Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire*** opened with $80 million.

Debuting #1, Amazon MGM's ***A Working Man*** earned $15.5 million in 3,262 theaters. This debut is almost on par with Statham and Ayer's previous film, ***The Beekeeper*** ($16.5 million).

All in all, this is a great start, and it's a sign that Statham can still attract audiences to theaters after more than 20 years in the business. The premise and the trailers were basically what you come to expect from Statham: an ""ordinary man"" with a job, who is actually a badass guy who kills bad guys. That's not different from other Statham titles but remember: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Which might be why Statham is still having a lucrative career, and is also one of the very few actors who only make theatrical films and zero TV shows. No amount of mixed reviews (52% on RT) will change the audience's mind here; with Statham, you know what you're getting.

According to Amazon MGM, 60% of the audience was male and 37% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. It was a ""dad movie""; 42% of the audience was 45 and over. They gave it a middling ""B"" on CinemaScore, below ***Beekeeper*** (B+). It's unlikely it can hold as well as ***Beekeeper*** due to the amount fo competition, but it should still finish with over $45 million domestically. Statham already has another film, ***Mutiny***, ready for January 2026 and it should also perform well.

Oh, ***Snow White***.

You know, we're not gonna act like there was hope here. The opening weekend fell way below expectations and the film posted some mediocre weekdays, indicating that the film would not have legs. Yet we weren't prepared for the second weekend drop.

***Snow White*** earned $14.3 million this weekend. That's a brutal 66% drop, which is worse than any of the Disney live-action remakes. It's similar to the second weekend drop of ***Dumbo*** (60.4%), but that film had ***Shazam!*** ($53.5 million) and ***Pet Sematary*** ($24.5 million) as competition, while ***Snow White*** has almost nothing. This drop is a testament of negative buzz and word of mouth that has plagued the film.

Through 10 days, ***Snow White*** has earned a terrible $66.9 million so far. With ***Minecraft*** coming to take away its PLF screens, it will continue falling. One thing is clear from this: the film is gonna miss $100 million domestically, which is simply unbelievable. 

In third place, ***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 1*** surpassed expectations. Playing in 2,478 theaters, the film earned a pretty great $11.7 million this weekend. By far the best debut in the ***Chosen*** franchise. The second and third parts will be released on April 4 and April 11, respectively.

Universal/Blumhouse's ***The Woman in the Yard*** debuted with $9.3 million in 2,842 theaters. That debut is not far off from Blumhouse's ***Wolf Man***, which disappointed with just $10.8 million back in January.

Considering the very low buzz and anemic pre-sales, this is a very solid numbers. And it's a testament to Blumhouse's strength that they can get a nothing film like this to debut to almost $10 million. Especially considering the weak reviews (43% on RT). Perhaps with very few horror choices, ***The Woman in the Yard*** managed to attract an audience that really wanted to go to the movies.

According to Universal, 55% of the audience was female, with its biggest demo women over 25 (31%). While it surpassed expectations, don't expect this to have a long life in theaters. It got a terrible ""C–"" on CinemaScore, which is the exact same grade as ***Wolf Man***. With competition on the way, it's unlikely ***The Woman in the Yard*** can make more than $25 million domestically.

In fifth place, A24's ***Death of a Unicorn*** flopped with just $5.7 million in 3,050 theaters. That's one of the worst debuts for a film playing in over 3,000 theaters, and it's another A24 misfire after the performance of ***Opus*** two weeks ago.

Comedy horrors can be a tough sell; A24's ***Y2K*** was another one of those which flopped back in December. Even with big names like Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega attached, they have not found much success outside franchises. And despite the A24 name usually signaling quality, the reviews for the film were very middling following its SXSW debut (55% on RT).

According to A24, 51% of the audience was male and its biggest demo was women over 25 (29%). They gave it a poor ""B–"", which is quite bad for a comedy. With so many options on the way, ***Death of a Unicorn*** will probably finish below $15 million domestically. That'd be disappointing.

GKids re-released ***Princess Mononoke*** in 330 IMAX theaters this weekend, where it earned a pretty great $3.8 million. That took its lifetime total to $14.7 million.

***Captain America: Brave New World*** eased 27%, adding $2.9 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $196.6 million.

***Black Bag*** went from second place to eighth place, dropping 48% and adding $2.1 million this weekend. The film has earned $18.7 million, and it's gonna finish with around $22 million domestically.

***Mickey 17*** is nearing the end of its run. It dropped 47%, grossing $1.9 million. The film's domestic total stands at $43.6 million, and it's going to finish with around $47 million.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Paramount's ***Novocaine***, which continues its collapse. This time, it had a steep 60%, earning just $1.4 million this weekend. The film has amassed just $18.8 million, and it will make just $21 million at most. Practically the same amount as ***Companion***.

***The Alto Knights*** didn't save face on its second weekend. It collapsed 65%, earning just $1.1 million this weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned an anemic $5.5 million, and it's gonna gonna close with less than $7 million domestically. Pathetic.

The documentary ***The Encampments*** (which follows the 2024 Palestine solidarity campus encampments at Columbia University and other pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses during the Gaza war) broke records despite playing in just one theater (the Angelika Film Center in New York). It earned $76,419 this weekend, which is the biggest per-theater average for a documentary. It will continue expanding in a few weeks.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Snow White*** was still the biggest Hollywood entry, but it added just $22.1 million overseas. And that took its worldwide total to just $142.7 million after two weeks. The best markets are the UK ($8.7M), Mexico ($6.9M), Italy ($6.6M), France ($5.5M) and Brazil ($4.5M). Very brutal all around. With the way it's dropping, the film won't much further than $200 million worldwide. Hell, if ***Minecraft*** surprises, it could go sub $200 million. At a $270 million budget, that's a flop for the ages.

***A Working Man*** debuted with $16.6 million overseas, for a pretty good $32.1 million worldwide debut. The best debuts were in China ($2.9M), Germany ($1.4M), Australia ($1.1M), Mexico ($1.1M), and the UK ($867K). With so many markets still left, this should get to $100 million worldwide easily.

- ***Sonic the Hedehog 3*** has closed with a fantastic $491 million worldwide. While it was later surpassed by ***Mufasa*** in daillies, the film is not a loser in the slightest. It's hard to be disappointed at a franchise where each film makes more than the one prior. Paramount already found their next big franchise, to the point that they already scheduled a fourth film for March 2027. That one should definitely hit $500 million.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

After years stuck in development hell, ***A Minecraft Movie*** is finally hitting theaters. The film stars Jason Momoa, Jack Black, Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, and Sebastian Hansen, and follows four misfits who are pulled through a portal into a cubic world that thrives on imagination, having no choice but to master the world while embarking on a quest with an expert crafter named Steve. The trailers have been... quite terrible, to say the least. But despite that, the popularity of ***Minecraft*** is just too big that families will probably still watch it. Let's just hope the final film is less painful than its trailers.

dune2,dune part two,1jnw4o0,Spider-Man 3 is a Compilation Film,"Spider-Man 3 is like a compilation film made from episodes of some unreleased live-action Spider-Man movie. The Sandman, Harry, symbiote and Eddie subplots might have been told in the background of several other episodes until they came together in the two part finale. The true focus of the series might have been the coming of age of Peter and MJ's love. On the cusp of the next step of their relationship MJ is forced to confront the end of her dream. Peter must discover if he can put her over himself just as he becomes as popular as he's always wanted. It might have been one of those great bittersweet Spider-Man arcs told over 13 episodes. 

The movie is disjointed. Peter, MJ, Harry, Flint, Eddie and the symbiote all go in and out of focus, then just happen to come together. In fact, Venom meeting Sandman is so randomly placed it feels like Venom was simply swinging around one night and bumped into him. Flint getting his powers is also out of nowhere. Harry's memory loss is such a hacky way of writing Goblin junior out for some time that it's actually kinda impressive they went through with it. Like a joke idea that somehow got past every executive at Sony.

In hindsight the obvious rewrite might have been to make Harry the one who turns Flint into Sandman and acquires the symbiote from a failed space shuttle landing. Maybe Harry offers Flint treatment for his daughter in exchange for killing Spidey. Maybe that leads Peter to Harry's lab where he gets infected by the symbiote and fights Goblin junior for the first time, leading to his memory loss. But, of course, hindsight is 20-20. Writing, especially under studio mandates, is hard. 

Still, the whole Sandman subplot works. With just a few scenes they tell a beautiful story about grief, regret and forgiveness. On this rewatch, I was more struck by all the performances. Thomas Haden Church and Kirsten Dunst are the standouts but everyone including Bryce Dallas Howard and Topher Grace (for this version of he character) are great. I know he's persona non grata for a good reason, but James Franco smiling at Peter at the diner is so deliciously evil. Peter himself, under the influence, is portrayed like a little troll by Tobey Maguire and it's fun to watch. Both Harry and Peter, in this universe, are high school losers who never really grew out of it. So when black suit Peter thinks he's cool and all that, he's cringe and I love that whole sequence of him snapping and walking. 

And I love the very final shot of the movie as Peter and MJ dance, unsure of where they'll go from here. Coerced or influenced, they both said and did things they need to come to terms with. The open but hopeful ending is beautiful.

Man, I miss this series but all good things must come to an end. And then be resurrected. Then once more. And again, simultaneously in animation. Then a memory wiped soft reboot. ",0,4,1743399156.0,2025-03-31 06:32:36,False
dune2,dune part two,1jn64cb,Dead Man Shoes (2004),"This one is mainly for the British audience since this film isn't very big outside of the UK

At the end of dead man shoes why did Richard say those things about Anthony?

There is a lot of conflicting theories about it I've found online 

Some people say he never really liked Anthony while others say that it's coming from a place of hard love ""he's his brother so hes allowed to say that"" 

There's also the people that say he blames Anthony for making him ""The Monster"" as Richard calls himself 

See me personally, I believe it's coming from a place of a mixture of these things since Richard says when he takes one of his brothers bullies to the place Anthony dies 

""He was my brother"" 

""I can't do it...I'm sorry kid I love you but I can't do it""

And the moment he tells Richard that Anthony was screaming his name and Richard replies 

""He still is"" implies Anthony is still in his head and he still cares about what happened to him and Anthony himself 

I believe Richard thinks he is no better than them and that is will be doing Anthony a favour by not finishing the last guy off since going on a revenge mission in Anthony's name is not what he would want despite Richards belief, he is quite clearly conflicted on his decision 

In Richards head they all deserve it and this is what Anthony would want as he apologised to Anthony in his head when he says ""I'm sorry kid I love you but I can't do it"" 

this is Richard coming to terms with reality 

This changes nothing 

I'm just as bad 

I think they deserve it but Anthony wouldn't 

I can't do this in my brother's name...

He WAS ashamed of Anthony but he loved him very much so 

He DID think his brother was all those things but I don't think he was actively trying to degrade Anthony he meant what he said because it was true but at the end of the day he was his brother and he partly blames himself for not being there for him as he joined the army to get away with him 

This is backed up by the scenes where he has visions of Anthony and himself bonding over the times they had together and Richard lecturing him over why these people are bad by giving him the substances they did while Richard was away in Afghanistan 

Although left up to interpretation the infamous cafe scene and ""Yea it was me"" scene in the middle of the street is Richard imagining himself protecting Anthony from them since he couldn't do it the first time round 

This is backed up with Richard telling Anthony to turn away from them and to walk to the end of the street so he could handle business with the men who bullied Anthony 

Anyway what does everyone else think? 

I absolutely love Dead Man shoes it's one of best films to watch with an amazing message, story and cast 10/10

It's also free to watch on YouTube and is under two hours long ",1,8,1743314511.0,2025-03-30 07:01:51,False
dune2,dune part two,1jn0xnq,Toy Story 3 is the best animated movie of the last 25 years.,"  
Toy Story 3 spoilers ahead.  
  
The Toy Story franchise often asks the question, “What is the purpose of a toy?” In the first film, getting back to Andy before he moves is all important; they need to be there for Andy. The fear of being replaced shouldn’t matter. As explained by Woody, “What matters isn’t how often we’re played with, it’s that we’re there for Andy when he needs us.” In part two, the idea that being in a museum for the public to enjoy, giving them a chance to see relics of entertainment history is explored, but in the end, being there for their owner, Andy, is determined to be the most important job of a toy. In Toy Story 3, being there for Andy is what Woody believes is still the most important thing, but the other toys in the crew think that there is more for them out in the world. They escape from  what they believe to be the trash, to sneak into a donation box. They act to serve themselves. They decide to give it a chance at a daycare where they will be able to enjoy playtime with other children; they can tell that Andy has grown out of playing with his toys.  
  
Once they arrive at the daycare, which turns out to be a sort of prison camp for toys, they realize that maybe hanging out in an attic waiting for a potential future is a better option. The movie turns into a fantastic prison break movie. Mr Potato Head becoming a tortilla had me cracking up the first time I watched it. They escape, but because they can’t leave anyone behind. One of the little green men gets stuck on a dumpster lid, and Lotso sucks. Now the toys are going to have to escape from something worse than a prison camp. They have to escape certain death, the trash.  
  
In the heart thumping emotional roller coaster starting with a dumpster, going through the garbage truck and potential destruction though the landfill, the toys are no longer concerned with being there for Andy. They are concerned with their lives. The culmination of the sequence has yet to make me not cry even after (maybe) five watches. I recently was just describing the scene to someone and got emotional simply thinking about it. The silence used in the lack of dialogue while they fall toward what looks like an entrance to hell, and realize that all they have in that moment is each other, with the music pounding, and the red of the fire reflecting off of their faces, make it feel as if the end of existence is inevitable. The toys reach for each others’ hands. They calm Bullseye, the de facto dog of the crew. Buzz and Jessie hold hands, which hits harder knowing the running bit that Buzz is nervous around Jessie. These moments, all the way up to the moment when the whole gang, with their leader Woody centered, red flames reflecting on their faces, inching slowing down towards their doom make me believe that they are truly not going to survive. But alas, we are watching a Disney movie, and we get a call back to a moment fifteen years ago, and the little green men from Pizza Planet no longer are subject to the claw, but they have mastered it, using it to serve their purpose. Hearing “the clawwww”, and realizing that the main characters are going to live – while still having tears on my cheeks – is still the largest feeling of relief while watching just about anything I’ve ever had. A nice note is that once the toys are safe, Buzz and Jessie are still holding hands.  
  
This movie really sticks the ending. These toys, who have decided that being there for Andy in the future is the best option, are going to have to go into the attic and wait it out until one day when perhaps Andy has kids, and perhaps remembers his old toys to perhaps give them to his children. This is what Woody has been saying the option is and that they all should take. But the last few days have made an impression on Woody. He got to have a great playtime with a little girl named Bonnie. He wants that playtime for his fellow toys too. He plants a note for Andy, getting him to give the toys to Bonnie. We get to see Andy hand over the toys to her, and then, even though he is reluctant to do so, give Woody to her too. The toys get what they have been desiring all along, one more playtime with Andy. But now, they will continue to make a child, Bonnie, happy. When they no longer had much use for Andy, they now could be there, reborn, to serve their purpose for a new owner. Having Bonnie wave Woody’s arm goodbye is the cherry on top; Andy is moving on, but the toys are moving on too.  
  
Best animated movie of the century. You may disagree, but film is art, and art is subjective, and to me it has yet to get any better than Toy Story 3.

**Rotten Tomatoes:** [93%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/warfare)

**Metacritic:** [78/100 ](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/warfare/)

Some Reviews:

[IndieWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/226) \- [David Ehrlich](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/david-ehrlich) \- B-

>“Warfare” is a film that wants to be felt more than interpreted, but it doesn’t make any sense to me as an invitation — only as a warning created from the wounds of a memory. The film is a clear love letter to Elliot Miller and the other men in Mendoza’s unit, but the verisimilitude with which it recreates the worst day of their lives — when measured against the ambiguity as to what it hopes to achieve by doing so — ultimately makes “Warfare” seem like a natural evolution of Garland’s previous work, so much of which has hinged on the belief that our history as a species (and, more recently, America’s self-image as a country) is shaped by the limits of our imagination. 

[San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/402) \- [G. Allen Johnson](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/g-allen-johnson) \- 4/4

>Garland has become this generation’s Oliver Stone, a studio filmmaker who is able to fearlessly capture the zeitgeist on hot-button issues few other Hollywood filmmakers touch, such as AI (2015’s “Ex Machina”), the political divide and a society’s slide toward violence (“Civil War”), and now the consequences of military diplomacy.

[Empire Magazine](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/148) \- [Alex Godfrey](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/alex-godfrey) \- 5/5

>War is hell, and Warfare refuses to shy away from it. Free of the operatics of most supposed anti-war films, it’s all the more effective for its simplicity. It is respectfully gruelling.

[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/213) \- [David Rooney](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/david-rooney)

>Garland is working in peak form and with dazzling technical command in what’s arguably his best film since his debut, *Ex Machina*. But the director’s skill with the compressed narrative would be nothing without the rigorous sense of authenticity and first-hand tactical knowledge that Mendoza brings to the material — and no doubt to the commitment of the actors.

[AV Club](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/833) \- [Brianna Zigler](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/brianna-zigler) \- B+

>Simply depicting the plain, ugly truth of human combat makes *Warfare* all the more effective as a piece of art setting out to evoke a time and place. The bombing set piece is equal parts horrific and thrilling; the filmmakers draw out the sensory reality of the slaughter as the men slowly come to, disoriented, ears ringing, ultimately leading to a frenzy of confusion, agita, and howling agony. The cacophony of torment and its reaction in the men meant to arrive with help is as grim as the bureaucratic resistance to send in medic vehicles to give the wounded any chance to survive their injuries.

[Independent (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/691) \- [Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/clarisse-loughrey) \- 3/5

>Alex Garland has now constructed what could be called his trilogy of violence... Warfare, at least, is the most successful of the three, because its myopia is a crucial part of its structure. Garland and Mendoza do, at least in this instance, make careful, considerate use of the film’s framework. We’re shown how US soldiers invade the home of an Iraqi family who, for the rest of *Warfare*’s duration, are held hostage in a downstairs bedroom, guns routinely thrust into their faces. In its final scene, they reemerge into the rubble of what was once their home, their lives upended by US forces and then abandoned without a second thought. It’s quite the metaphor.

[Daily Telegraph (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/921) \- [Robbie Collin](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/robbie-collin) \- 5/5

>It’s necessarily less sweeping than Garland’s recent Civil War, and for all its fire and fury plays as something of a philosophical B-side to that bigger earlier film. I’d certainly be uncomfortable calling it an action movie, even though vast tracts of it are nothing but. It leaves questions ringing in your ears as well as gunfire.

[Guardian](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/205) \- [Peter Bradshaw](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/peter-bradshaw) \- 3/5

>In some ways, Warfare is like the rash of war-on-terror pictures that appeared 20 years ago, such as Kathryn Bigelow’s The Hurt Locker or Nick Broomfield’s Battle for Haditha, or indeed Brian De Palma’s interesting, underrated film Redacted. But Warfare doesn’t have the anti-war reflex and is almost fierce in its indifference to political or historical context, the resource that should be more readily available two decades on. The movie is its own show of force in some ways, surely accurate in showing what the soldiers did, moment by moment, though blandly unaware of a point or a meaning beyond the horror.

[Times (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/823) \- [Kevin Maher](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/kevin-maher) \- 5/5

>This is a movie that’s as difficult to watch as it is to forget. It’s a sensory blitz, a percussive nightmare and a relentless assault on the soul.

[Deadline](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2256) \- [Gregory Nussen](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/gregory-nussen)

>While it aims for an unromantic portrait of combat, it can only conceive of doing so through haptic recreation in lieu of actual characterization. The result is a cacophonous temper tantrum, a vacuous and perfidious advertisement for military recruitment.

[London Evening Standard](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/446) \- [Martin Robinson](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/martin-robinson) \- 4/5

>Given all the America First stuff going on, and the history of the Iraq War, Warfare may suffer from a lack of sympathy for American military operations. And yet, the sheer technical brilliance and strength of performances, cannot fail to connect when you take on the film on its own terms, as pure human experience in the most hellish of circumstances.",1159,613,1743169556.0,2025-03-28 13:45:56,False
dune2,dune part two,1jlt9tx,"U Turn (1997), AKA The Worst Thing Oliver Stone’s Ever Done","_U Turn_ has one of the weirder shelf lives of Oliver Stone’s movies. Originating as the 1994 John Ridley screenplay _Stray Dogs_, it was picked up by Oliver Stone & collaborator Richard Rutkowski, where it was substantially reworked – however, because their edits were less than 40% of the script, WGA rules meant Ridley was credited as the sole writer. Stone filmed the script (now called _U Turn_) in six weeks, and the film itself was released in late 1997…to somewhat negative reviews: It made back only a third of its budget, and got Stone a Razzie nomination for Worst Director. Oddly enough, while you won’t find much love for it from those who watched it at the time, _U Turn_ has gained something of a resurgence online as a mid-career gem for Stone.

Having actually watched _U Turn_ on the Internet’s recommendation…the haters were right. If _Natural Born Killers_ wrecked Stone’s writing ability, _U Turn_ proved that Stone could no longer do films that weren’t Big Dumb Objects even if he wanted to. If anything the haters may have understated how bad this movie is, because literally every change Stone & Rutkowski made to the script manages to be wrong:

(Note: It’s difficult to discussing one specific point of failure in _U Turn_ without bringing its the film’s failures as a whole. As such, there will be heavy spoilers; be forewarned).

THE PACING: This is actually the one major issue carried over from the original script: Ridley’s screenplay is ~120 pages (so about two hours), but most of the plot is within the first 30 and last 40 minutes, so the midsection comprises the buildup for the film’s plot threads. Stone resolves one thread early on and inexplicably removes another’s payoff but keeps the runtime the same – which relegates the film’s middle to superfluity. Other choices that Stone made would fit better in a 90-minute movie than a two-hour one, so Stone not trimming the runtime signals both his inattention to the script and a lack of any real guardrails on his self-indulgence.

THE CASTING: Tom Cruise was Oliver Stone’s original choice for protagonist Bobby Cooper (John Stewart in Ridley’s screenplay – for the sake of simplicity, I’ll refer to this character as just Bobby from here on out), but ended up turning it down. Stone then offered the part to Sean Penn, who turned it down due to scheduling conflicts; Bill Paxton was subsequently set to star, but had to pull out a week before filming, by which time Penn had become available.

That Penn was Stone’s second choice for the lead is a major red flag for the film. Tom Cruise can naturally pull off irritation without compromising charm, and Paxton did “affable lead with a dark secret” in _One False Move_. But antiheroic Sean Penn radiates nothing so much as sheer slimebaggery: This may be in fitting with noir conventions, but Penn is only ever shown pissed-off at everything, and he’s not able to keep the audience on his side. (Not incidentally, Penn held a grudge against Stone over his experience filming _U Turn_ for about a decade). There’s zero indication that Penn’s Bobby has any meaningful objection to killing for money (the film’s plot), and Bobby is so pointedly unsympathetic that it’s impossible to care what happens to him.

Oliver Stone also originally wanted Marlon Brando to play the blind Native beggar, and Sharon Stone to play mestiza deuteragonist Grace McKenna – these parts went to Jon Voight and Jennifer Lopez. It’s worth noting that for someone as vocal about the plight of Native Americans, Stone apparently hadn’t even contemplated hiring a Native actor for these roles (unless you count the Puerto Rican Jennifer as mestiza, but even then her casting was an olive branch for a failed Noriega casting session).

THE CAST: The Arizona town Bobby is stuck in is itself a villain of the movie: Ridley puts heavy emphasis on the heat’s deranging effects – preferable only to the reservation – but while the town (Sierra in Ridley’s script) is miserable, mechanic Darrell (Billy Bob Thornton) is the only fully unsympathetic character; everyone else is mostly just burnt out. This is the conceit of one of the film’s running gags: Teenager Jenny (Claire Danes) continually hits on Bobby, clearly an attempt to escape the town, and this pisses off her boyfriend Toby “TNT” Tucker (Joaquin Phoenix).

“Small towns are hell” is by far the part of the script Stone is most interested in, and this is heavily informed by his own conception of the Ugly American, and rural/suburban Americans as decadent toxic waste. To that effect he renames Sierra “Superior” and removes all sympathetic traits from _U Turn_’s supporting cast: Sheriff Virgil Potter (Powers Boothe) goes from resigned lawman to a gleefully corrupt hick. Toby “TNT” Tucker (Joaquin Phoenix) loses his father’s gruesome death to become just some asshole teen nuisance; Jake McKenna (Nick Nolte) goes from unambitious businessman to the film’s primary villain. Even Darrell gains a sizable gut in the film, at great cost to Billy Bob Thornton (he’s described as very lean in _Stray Dogs_). This cardboardification would be fine in a 90-minute movie, but for a two-hour runtime it’s gratuitously unpleasant and frankly smug and douchey – it’s rubbing the audience’s faces in the town’s awfulness to no real purpose.

Compounding the problem is that the cast are acting in entirely different movies, evidence that Stone is paying little attention to tone. Phoenix & Danes are acting in something like Ridley’s original script. Penn has been established as a straight-up scumbag; Nolte & Boothe are outright grotesques. Thornton and Voight, meanwhile, are comic characters of a vein that wouldn’t be out of place in a Farrelly Bros. movie (Thornton could maybe fit in a Coen Bros. film, but Voight is a bit too gross for that). Jennifer Lopez is the only actor giving a grounded performance – which is to say, the only performance with awareness of…

THE SEXUAL ABUSE PLOT: The central twist is that Jake McKenna is Grace’s father: He’d been raping her since her childhood, forced Grace to marry him after he murdered her Apache mother, and thus is why Grace wants Bobby to kill Jake. This twist is entirely a Stone/Rutkowski invention: In Ridley’s treatment Jake & Grace are unrelated – for that matter, his Jake is never a rapist – and Grace wants to kill Jake for his $100K because he’s too content to leave Sierra. (Jake’s motive is the same throughout both versions of the script: He considers Grace an ingrate, feels embarrassed by her cuckolding him & can get a small payout).

Problem #1 is that this is revealed a half-hour into the movie. There are no added wrinkles to the story, no real back and forth, indeed no indications Grace might be hiding anything; she is a sheep in sheep’s clothing, and indeed the third act confirms her story by showing Jake raping Grace. This streamlines the plot, but to the film’s detriment: It immediately makes Grace the most sympathetic character in the film, so the absence of complications to Grace’s story removes any real dilemma for Bobby – and by extension, a good portion of the runtime, as the poor pacing robs this of narrative momentum. (Roger Ebert noted in his 1.5-star review that the half-hour makes obvious that the characters only act as they do Because The Plot Said So, and this is probably what he meant by that remark – this is one of those changes that makes more sense in a 90-minute film). Cruise & Paxton could maybe sell Bobby’s dithering as qualms over killing, but with Penn this just comes off as rank cowardice.

Problem #2 is that Jennifer Lopez’ Grace is the rare sort of good performance that actually undermines the movie. Part of it is just the nature of the role has written – taken together the supporting cast’s characterizations suggest a farce or a broad black comedy, so Lopez’ dramatic performance makes everyone else look worse & Stone like he isn’t even trying to take the CSA plotline seriously. (That Grace is almost the only character to avoid caricature exacerbates the problem; of the supporting cast, only Claire Danes’ Jenny escapes unscathed, mostly due to how small her role is). Quite a few reviews have given Lopez shit for not selling Grace as a _femme fatale_, but this isn’t what Lopez is really going for with Grace so much as, first and foremost, an abused teenager. Lopez is competent at playing the seductress – but this is play-acting on Grace’s part, as her primary character traits are meekness and a childlike sensitivity; if you knocked 8-10 years off of Grace’s age (Lopez was 27 at the time of filming), very little about the performance would change. Lopez’ Grace is so devoid of malice that she never gives Bobby (or the audience) cause to be wary, and this only makes the film (and Bobby’s) later about-faces on her even more artificial & idiotic.

Problem #3 is that this characterization _is true to what Stone has actually written_, if not quite intended – having written Grace _to be_ a sexual abuse victim, Stone them seems oddly unwilling to make her _truly_ villainous, so he goes to great lengths to exculpate her whenever possible. This is evident in two of the movie’s key scenes:

In Ridley’s screenplay, when Bobby & Jake fight to the death at the McKenna residence, (Jake has gotten the drop on Bobby), Grace only intervenes in Bobby’s favor at the last second; this hesitation causes Bobby to accuse her of getting off on the violence. In the film Grace is scared, but is eager to help Bobby & improvises with him a plan to kill Jake after Plan A went awry.

More damning to Stone is Sheriff Virgil Potter’s fatal traffic stop. Ridley has Virgil make Bobby & Grace an offer: He knows the two killed Jake McKenna for his money, but since he _also_ wants out of the town, he’ll let them go if they give him ~1/3 of the $100K. This is an explicit threat on Virgil’s part, but he also indicates that he’ll happily leave them be if he gets his cut – Grace kills him while pretending to get it, before there’s any indication he’s lying. This isn’t a wholly _unreasonable_ act, but it is a morally ambiguous one (Grace’s initial defense focuses solely on the fact Virgil wanted the money), and combined with her hesitation against Jake it disinclines Bobby to give her the benefit of the doubt.

Stone just makes Sheriff Virgil Grace’s jilted lover, incidentally his one note of complexity under Stone – Grace promised she’d leave with him rather than Bobby, but Virgil was too craven to actually end Jake’s abuse. Here Grace kills Virgil while he’s actively trying to kill Bobby & openly wants to kill Grace. In both cases Stone’s Grace only kills in self-defense, which Bobby is witness to – Stone has thus created a situation where the film’s ostensible _femme fatale_ hasn’t actually done anything wrong. Ridley’s Grace (who, let’s recall, was never sexually abused) was still not particularly monstrous, so Stone’s softening of her can only be a choice, but it makes Bobby’s later betrayal of Grace all the more nonsensical.

(Problem #3.5 is the resolution of the running gag between Bobby, Jenny & TNT. Bobby eventually has enough of TNT’s shit & beats him to near-death before he goes to kill Jake McKenna, and in the original script this is why Sheriff Virgil Potter stops Bobby & Grace; he wants to congratulate Bobby, and this gives him the pretext to inquire about Jake’s murder. This dialogue isn’t in the film, thereby rendering TNT, Jenny & the entire gag plot-irrelevant – it’s not like it’s at odds with Stone’s replacement motive, so its removal is even more inexplicable).

Problem #4 is a flashback where a topless Grace is having sex with the sheriff. This flashback isn’t actually in the script: Jennifer Lopez has stated this was a last-minute excuse for Oliver Stone to see her naked, and that in the lead-up to filming it Stone came to her dressing room and asked her to disrobe (he was shamed into apologizing later by an assistant). While the script doesn’t _show_ the sex scene, dialogue from Grace is unambiguous that the Sheriff’s “relationship” with her is just sexual extortion – i.e. _rape_. (Lopez pointed this out in an attempt to dissuade Stone from filming her topless; she’s wearing a slip when Jake rapes her, so being nude of the sheriff would be out of character). This dialogue is removed from the final film, seemingly in exchange for the sex scene – this shows that Stone _knows_ how sympathetic Grace is, and is perfectly willing to downplay that for the sake of horniness, but not for the sake of the script.

JON VOIGHT: The blind Native beggar, and his apparently-dead dog, is a minor gag character in both versions of the screenplay, ultimately serving to forewarn Bobby before he kills Jake, after which he disappears from the script. The beggar’s warning takes different forms in the two scripts – Ridley’s admonition, building on the beggar’s previously spouting cryptic sayings & immediately following his pseudo-philosophical conversation with Bobby, is: “Thing’s ain’t always what they seem. You got to ask yourself: Is it worth it?” The twist is that the beggar is just bullshitting – he isn’t really blind, and his dog isn’t dead, just asleep. Under Stone he prefaces this remark with how chasing after a Hot Piece of Ass got him blinded (and thus the perils of The Duplicity of Wimmin), corroborated by a shot of his damaged eyes.

The beggar is the only character to be expanded rather than flattened by Stone: He’s given more airtime and a chance to monologue about the maltreatment of Native Americans, and is legitimated by Stone’s narrative. He is the worst character in the film – both due to execution and his serving as a font of Stone’s thoughtless/noxious racial & sexual politics.

First off: Jon Voight is just fucking terrible in this movie. 1997 wasn’t a good year for Voight performances – he also starred as the villains in _Anaconda_ and _Most Wanted_, the latter earning him a Razzie nomination – but the beggar is easily the worst of these turns, and fittingly his other Razzie nom for 1997. The film’s beggar doesn’t have a very dignified poverty to start with (he’s perpetually covered in snot), but Voight doesn’t even try to give him class; he plays him not as a “wise old Indian” so much as “doddering old fart.” There’s no indication before his final scene that he’s anything more than (ill-conceived) comic relief, so his warning lacks dramatic weight – if anything, he comes off as a parody of Stone’s idealization of Native Americans.

Native Americans are a common motif in Oliver Stone’s filmography. They serve to inspire Jim Morrison in _The Doors_; Mickey and Mallory Knox recognize the killing of a Native as their moral event horizon in _Natural Born Killers_; _U Turn_, in addition to the aforementioned monologue, centers around the mestiza Grace McKenna (in fact the ending takes after _Duel In the Sun_) – so on one level it is fitting that the most morally upstanding characters in _U Turn_ are Grace & the blind beggar. Yet if Stone is passionate about the plight of the Native American, he is not very intelligent about it, and in _U Turn_ he seems to have imported _Duel In the Sun_’s racial & sexual politics uncritically. 

The beggar’s warnings in each version of the script actually work better with the opposing script’s version of Grace. Stone’s warning would reinforce Ridley’s Grace (it’d just be gilding the lily), but it makes more sense for the Grace that Stone actually wrote to have Ridley’s ambiguous warning. As it is Stone makes no effort to sell the beggar’s credibility, but Voight’s performance merely aggravates the existing issue that Grace is much more credible than the beggar. Stone’s warning is explicitly misogynistic, so the obvious takeaway would be that Bobby’s listening to it is runaway paranoia and jealousy – but then why legitimize the beggar’s story? This implies we’re to take this at more or less face value, that Grace is a ticking time bomb – but Grace has shown no instability or even guile in the time Bobby’s known her, and as far as Bobby is concerned the beggar’s just some asshole who’s been pestering him for cash all day long. The only “risk factor” for Grace is that she was sexually abused, so this only serves to perpetuate DEFILED FOREVER horseshit: This might’ve flown for a noir villainess, but Lopez’ Grace is if anything the film’s heroine, so this is where the noir and Tragic Mestiza modes Stone’s writing in fatally undermine each other. On a racial level this is asking us to take the (presumably fully-indigenous) beggar’s musings over the mestiza Grace, solely because the latter is mestiza – a racism only compounded by the fact that Stone never even considered casting a Native actor to play the beggar. The most sympathetic reading of this ending is that Stone realized that his Grace was no longer even passably villainous, so he added the Bitches Be Treacherous anecdote to the beggar’s dialogue as compensation…only this just serves as incompetent “tell, don’t show” that is patently offensive into the bargain.

THAT STUPID FUCKING ENDING: And yet – and yet! – all of these flaws would be forgivable (flawed, but forgivable) if the ending were any good, and it’s worth discussing how John Ridley originally ended his screenplay:

On the drive out of Sierra, Bobby is unsettled enough by the Sheriff’s killing (and per a radio announcement, the ensuing manhunt) that he decides to ditch Grace. He & Grace come to blows over this – while Grace counters that the Sheriff would’ve killed them anyway, Bobby points out that they can’t really explain this to the cops, and Grace might try to sell him out again in a police confrontation. After telling Grace he’s leaving her once they reach California (and calling her “a lying, backstabbing bitch” to her face), the two decide to get rid of Jake’s body. Bobby trips over the precipice – he’s not sure if Grace pushed him or was trying to grab him – and is too injured to walk back up. A suspicious Grace doesn’t take up Bobby’s plan to pull him up via a rope in the trunk; Bobby in turn refuses to throw Grace the car keys. Grace takes the $100K into the desert, leaving Jake to his fate. It is 50 miles to the nearest town.

Here’s how Stone rewrites the ending:

Bobby & Grace stop to dump the Sheriff’s corpse when Bobby out of nowhere cold-cocks Grace & takes her gun – when asked why, he says it’s because Grace lied about her family & says he’s ditching her at California. Grace pushes Bobby off the precipice, and upon landing Bobby makes an obviously-insincere about-face asking Grace to help him. Grace inexplicably takes him up, descending the gorge to take his keys…but really to get Jake’s gun (and then Bobby’s keys), all while they’re pitching woo at each other. Grace closes in to kiss Bobby – upon which Bobby strangles Grace, but not before she mortally shoots him in the gut. Bobby struggles to the car & starts it…only for the radiator hose to blow out due to Darrell’s ineptitude as a mechanic. Bobby has a bitter laugh at his misfortune; cue credits.

This ending is the absolute worst of idiot plots. Bobby is actively being written as unreasonable to the nth degree: Grace has shown him nothing but love and has only killed her abusers, both in defense of herself & Bobby – her only moment of weakness is rolling on Bobby when Sheriff Potter stops them, but this is clearly a panic reaction rather than duplicity. The logistical headache of killing a policeman _would_ provide a reason to break with Grace, but this & the radio broadcast are omitted from the final film – so he just looks like an asshole and a fucking idiot. On Grace’s end: A femme fatale wouldn’t be stupid enough to get near let alone believe Bobby, and an ingenue wouldn’t believe someone who just turned on her for basically no reason, at least not enough for Bobby to get the drop on her. Stone intends this as tragedy for his tragic mestiza (hence the _Duel In the Sun_ reference), but this is just all so fucking stupid; and the much less sympathetic Bobby gets the better of her, so this only serves as an insult to anyone still invested in the movie. The entire chain of events is only possible if Grace and Bobby somehow lost 80 IQ points on the drive out of Arizona – Oliver Stone has destroyed this screenplay & its characters for the sake of a bad joke and an even worse reference. Fuck Oliver Stone, and motherfuck this movie.

All that said: Robert Richardson’s cinematography is pretty good. I think we can all agree on that.",0,25,1743162808.0,2025-03-28 11:53:28,False

*Levon Cade left behind a decorated military career in the black ops to live a simple life of working construction. However, when human traffickers kidnap his boss's daughter, his search to bring her home uncovers a world of corruption far greater than he ever could have imagined.*

**Some Reviews:**

[JoBlo's Movie Network](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/573) \- [Chris Bumbray](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/chris-bumbray)

>Jason Statham and David Ayer have a nice thing going. *The Beekeeper* revitalized their careers to a certain extent, with Ayer putting a superb polish on what could have been a run-of-the-mill action flick, turning into perhaps Statham’s best solo action vehicle. And now, they’re back at it again with the Sylvester Stallone-penned *A Working Man*, which is based on the novel “Levon’s Trade” by Chuck Dixon (a way better title than the Seagal-like *A Working Man*). 

[Casey's Movie Mania](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/3688) \- [Casey Chong](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/casey-chong)

>Some of the shortcomings aside, it’s worth noting that A Working Man is the first part of Chuck Dixon’s *Levon Cade* series, which has so far released a total of 11 books. For now, the movie gets off to a decent, though uneven beginning for a franchise starter and if there’s a sequel in the pipeline — depending on the first movie’s box-office result, of course — here’s hoping it improves for the next round.

[The Guardian - Jesse Hassenger](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/26/a-working-man-review-jason-statham)

>At its best, a movie like A Working Man functions as an update to the hard-boiled detective story, with a resilient bruiser conducting his own off-books missing-person investigation. There’s a little of that juice as Levon does some amateur undercover work as a drug buyer, cozying up to a motorcycle gang (the aforementioned leader sits on a chrome throne, another touch that feels like Ayer’s doing). But Stallone and Ayer don’t have the patience for too much skullduggery; skullsmashery is more their thing, and as an action movie, A Working Man doesn’t reach the giddy highs of Statham’s best.

[Screen Rant - Mary Kassel](https://screenrant.com/a-working-man-movie-review/)

>It doesn't take an active imagination to see where the future of *A Working Man* is going. A few plots are left unresolved. Levon still has to win custody of his young daughter, paving the way for a sequel or two if the film makes a profit. Statham has proved himself an asset at the box office, and when it comes to movies like *A Working Man*, a critical reception has little to do with the project's performance. It's a mindless good time, and I'll be interested to see where the franchise goes.

[NextBestPicture - Dan Bayer](https://nextbestpicture.com/a-working-man/)

>For better or worse, “A Working Man” is pure brute force, barrelling through its standard (if overstuffed) plot with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, pummeling you into submission with its hard-hitting (if uninspired) fight scenes. You may not be wowed by the action on display here, but you feel every single body blow and gunshot. That’s exactly what you expect from a Statham vehicle, and that’s what “A Working Man” delivers, even if it doesn’t give you any more than that.

[The Reel Bits - Richard Gray](https://thereelbits.com/2025/03/27/review-a-working-man/)

>While never destined to revolutionise the genre, Ayer and Stallone have struck upon a reliable formula in a ready-made franchise package. One could happily consume these like fast food every couple of years, safe in the knowledge that there’s always another job for this working man right around the corner.

[Deadline](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2256) \- [Pete Hammond](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/pete-hammond)

>Ayer has made a bunch of films I really liked, particularly the cop drama *End Of Watch* which had a better role for Pena opposite Jake Gyllenhaal, and Brad Pitt’s WW2 tank epic, *Fury.* Here as in *Beekeeper,* he delivers a tightly wound action showcase for his star and keeps it moving along.

[Variety](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/466) \- [Peter Debruge](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/peter-debruge)

>This wasn’t how I envisioned Ayer’s career shaping up... A few of his movies are very good, but it increasingly feels like he’s recycling old plots, the way straight-to-tape action movies did in the late 20th century.

dune2,dune part two,1jk57xn,WALL-E is Deeper Than You Thought,"This movie is obviously widely adored. A smaller number of people find it boring which is a personal choice, but some dismiss it as a shallow “littering is bad” story.

However, WALL-E is more than just an environmentalist theme - it’s a statement on routine, duty, responsibility, and accountability, with direct critiques of consumption. 

To start, robots and people all have their pattern, with robots having directives and humans having routine. 

They go about these routines with little regard for consequences and what is going on around them, resulting in decay. With humans, this is seen in the consumption and detachment on the Axiom ship, resulting in deterioration of the colony. It also is why Earth is in the state it is - the waste of this routine consumption is littered all across the planet, resulting in its nearly uninhabitable state. 

With robots, their routine revolves around a directive, which is their purpose and function; those functions however often end up to be futile. WALL-E’s directive is to clean up the Earth, but the shots of all the litter on Earth that remains m, and broken down versions of himself in the rubble show this to be impossible at an individual level. EVE’s directive is to retrieve evidence of habitability on Earth and return people home, but there is a larger conspiracy by security robots on the ship to maintain the existing routine, staying in space and avoiding Earth. Other robots serve human functions, but this service ultimately perpetuates the rot of society. 

Here comes WALL-E and EVE. Through their romance, the schedule is broken, forcing several individuals to break their consumption habits/routine, and scrambling many robot functions on the ship in order to serve their ultimate mission. What results is a series of actions that will ultimately save and regenerate both people and the planet. 

By directly disrupting the existing processes serving to keep people in this consumption-heavy, stagnant existence, genuine progress is made. Long-standing beliefs are questioned and confronted - the need for a constant virtual life, the need for maintaining our comfortable and hedonistic lifestyle, a fear of putting in the work needed in stewarding Earth responsibly - and the conveyer belt of desires and mindless thought leading to destruction stops. 

The irony is that through subverting their routines, our two protagonists are able to achieve their directive. WALL-E cleans up the planet by leaving his routine for EVE, which ultimately brings the change needed to actually rejuvenate and clean up the Earth. EVE’s motivation near the end of the movie is to return the plant not just for her given purpose, but to save WALL-E; it is WALL-E who also finds the plant in the first place. Their mission was still achieved, but the means looked very different to what was expected, and neither could have done it without the other. 

There is also a theme about accountability. Humanity was so hellbent on this routine that we left our planet to continue it, tasking robots to save the Earth. This by-the-books, corporate attempt to save the world without fundamentally challenging our system predictably wasn’t good enough. By avoiding responsibility and avoiding confrontation with our habits - in fact, relying on those same habits to somehow change the outcome - the Earth would remain stagnant. The captain refused this way of thinking, held up by all the routine previously mentioned, and demanded that we take a stern hand in righting our past wrongs.  

The implications to climate change are telling. We are stuck in our current routines, out of a feeling of necessity and on the treadmill of consumption, towards decay of both our Earth and ourselves. In order to halt this rot, we must seriously question our everyday existence, our consumption, our habits; we must hold ourselves to account; and finally, we must rely on and lookout for each other. We cannot trust this current routine to save us; we must course correct. 

The name of the ship itself is telling: an “axiom” is something which, though not necessarily true, is widely accepted (atleast in classical philosophy). We believe ourselves to be stuck in our current way of living and consumption, but faced with the threat perpetual rot and stagnation, we must confront this belief. 

So yes, WALL-E is about climate change. But the message is a bit deeper than “we should stop littering and take care of our planet.” WALL-E is a call to action, asking us all to question our part in the conveyer belt. It shows us how flawed our ways are by reducing them to the most extreme forms - our consumption as literal conveyer belts in a virtual world detached from life leading to waste, and our half-hearted efforts to correct these mistakes without changing ourselves as futile as cleaning up a planet full of garbage. Only by questioning our patterns, and relying on each other, will we help ourselves and achieve the goals we set. ",0,13,1742969516.0,2025-03-26 06:11:56,False

dune2,dune part two,1jivkkv,The Monkey & the generational curse of your father's unresolved issues,"Just saw The Monkey last night and thoroughly enjoyed it! As always after seeing a movie I came to reddit to read a bunch of discussion threads and see what folks are saying. Lots of people talked about enjoying the campy kills and dialogue. Turning into pink mist from being electrocuted but your leg somehow flies off and smacks Theo James? ""It is what it is...the word of our Lord."" Good stuff! What I haven't seen as much talk about is the meaning of the film. Maybe it's been posted about already and I just haven't seen it, but I got the impression some viewers were unhappy with the lack of lore for the monkey-demon itself. I thought there was a clear and neatly-resolved message inside the delightfully silly package so I thought I'd add my two cents review.

To me the monkey represents the emotional burden of men, especially fathers\*, who repress their traumas, become stunted, and end up hurting those around them. The film shows us this harm to others on two parallel levels: the realistically fucked up relationship of an emotionally distant dad and his son, and the fantastically gruesome harm perpetrated by the monkey.

\*Of course the message works for anyone but I think fatherhood and masculinity is the most explicit. All four characters involved in the struggle over the monkey are men with dad issues. The main antagonistic relationships are dad-son, brother-brother, dad-step dad. Elijah Wood's foil to the main character is literally a ""fatherhood expert.""

Hal and Bill both become a type of man in this vein: Hal emotionally repressed and distant, Bill physically violent. In real life a man like Bill wouldn't need magic monkey powers to kill people over his emotions. Family violence is a common tragedy, and at least in part this is because a patriarchal society demands men repress their emotions and become islands unto themselves (""she was my mom too"" ""I never thought of it that way""). The monkey kills people around the brothers because there is an evil generational curse on them, but it's only a magic one for film reasons. The real generational curse is that emotionally unavailable fathers wreak havoc on people, especially their sons.

The movie resolves when the brothers open up to each other and Hal confronts death (literally) along with his feelings of guilt, shame, and fear. By doing this in front of his son he's choosing to deal with his emotions in a healthy way and end the vicious cycle. Likewise about the monkey he says they have to ""recognize that it's ours and keep it close"" so it can do further harm. The evil bastard monkey was the emotions we repressed all along!

For me it was exactly what I wanted it to be: enjoyably campy and dumb in the best way, but with an actual message buried in the tomfoolery. Watching it with this in mind made me enjoy the movie more and also made the ending feel quite satisfying.

dune2,dune part two,1jioin1,"9 (2009), the machine was meant to be the hero. (Mini essay)","
Not all of Chekhov’s guns have to be physical objects, for instance we see it all the time in monster movies. The monsters weakness is revealed or discovered, and later used against it. To give the audience the information that the werewolf is weak to silver, but never put it into practice, creates the same narrative void as is the protagonist found a physical “anti werewolf gun” only to never use it.    
    
I would like to bring up the fact that the whole movie, 9(2009), is built around an unfired ‘Chekhov’s idea.’ We are directly given information that in my mind, built up a completely different and non-traditional ending that I was so excited for, only for the movie to fall on it’s face into the ‘generic ending’ puddle, including a good ol’, out of nowhere, Deus Ex Machina.   
    
A quick synopsis:
The movie 9 is set in a post apocalyptic world, the story starts with a scientist, the last remaining human, transferring the last part of his soul into a sack puppet using a device referred to as the Talisman. The scientist dies after the transfer.   
    
The newly created sack puppet, labelled ‘9,’ heads off into the apocalyptic wasteland, only to be attacked by demonic robot creations. 9 eventually meets up with sack puppets 1-8. Hijinks ensue and eventually we meet the evil ‘Fabrication Machine,’ an evil machine that was corrupted by the warmongering government, resulting in it building murder machines that eventually turned on humanity and led to the lifeless wasteland the movie takes place in.   
    
The evil Fabrication Machine obtains the soul transfer Talisman, and begins hunting down the sack puppets, eventually sucking the souls out of 1, 2, 5, 6 and 8 into itself.   
    
For the grand finale, 9 gets the Talisman back from the Fabrication Machine, and suddenly the Talisman that has up until now only ever been a soul transference device, becomes a Deus Ex Machina laser that goes pew pew pew and kills the Machine, freeing the souls of the sack puppets (but not reviving them.) Ultimately this ending leaves just 3, 4, 7 and 9 to a bleak future, just the four of them in the endless expanse of a ruined world.   
   
Now, what is the Chekhov’s information I want to moan about? Throughout the movie we learn the following:   

•	The Scientist from the beginning is the one who created the Fabrication Machine, he was a good man who built the machine to build and create for peace.  

•	The Fabrication Machine is corrupted by the government, but the Scientist specifically says that: “My creation was hopelessly flawed and indeed dangerous, for it lacked the human soul”.   

•	The Scientist with his benevolent soul, has transferred his soul into the 9 sack puppets. “You are all that's left of humanity. You are all the pieces of my soul.”.  

•	The Fabrication Machine could easily destroy the sack puppets physically, but seems to go out of its way to specifically absorb their souls using the talisman. Note that the machine already has a specific slot/port on it to use the talisman presumably designed and installed by the Scientist.    
    
So what ending did I see being built up with this information? Lets review:    
     
•	The machine is designed to create, it just chooses to create death. It still could create life, at least artificial life, should it have a change of heart.   

•	The machine is evil specifically because it lacks a soul, however the Scientist included a way for it to absorb souls, since it already has a port for the Talisman. This implies the Scientist already had the Talisman and soul transfer technology before building the Fabrication Machine.   

•	The Scientist transferred his ‘good soul’ into 9 sack puppets. The Machine hunts down the Talisman and sack puppets, prioritising absorbing their segments of soul over physically destroying them.   

•	Did the scientist plan this all along? Was the machine always meant to have a soul, but the government stopped him? Was releasing his soul into the wasteland in the form of sack puppets a desperate attempt at self-preservation, or a last ditch effort to provide his corrupted creation with the soul it both needs and craves to fulfil its original benevolent purpose?      
     
So, what happens if the machine captures all 9 puppets? It’ll have a complete soul, the one thing it needed to not be a dick. Maybe it can find and help any remaining humans, or just create a new world of its own creations?    
     
A lot of this information was dumped on the main character, 9, right at the end, just before he laser blasts the machine. However, the end I saw coming, and was really excited about, was the idea that 9 would have to convince or trick the remaining sack puppets to sacrifice themselves to the Fabrication Machine, allowing the Scientist’s soul to reform the machine and start rebuilding the world.     
     
Pros of my ending:    
Interesting, dramatic, unexpected. Something different from the usual Hollywood happy-ever-after. In my opinion the original ending is actually pretty bleak, yeah they defeated the BBEG but there’s nothing left of the world, just the four remaining sack puppets, two of which are mute with childlike personalities. The original ending doesn’t set up any kind of post-movie goals or motivation for the remaining sack puppets, they don’t even need to eat or drink. Do the characters plan to just sit in a ruined building somewhere and twiddle their thumbs?    
     
Cons of my ending:    
It’s heavily implied that the Scientist was the last human, there isn’t really any world for the Fabrication Machine to rebuild once it turns good. Maybe there are survivors or untouched countries beyond the setting of the movie? The Scientists plan of just releasing his soul through sock puppets and just hoping that his machine eventually hunts them all down is a bit convoluted, could he not just find the machine himself?    
      
It’s noted on: https://nine.fandom.com/wiki/Deleted_Scenes - Trivia.    
      
“At some point during the preproduction, they had an adaptation where 9's soul actually gets sucked into the Fabrication Machine, and meets its soul to discover that the Machine was really ""0"".”.  
    
Which hints at a similar concept, but implies the Scientist put the evil part of his soul into the Machine?

dune2,dune part two,1jh9jry,Sharing My (Current) Movie Scores!,"So for the past several years, I've been watching movies online that I feel like watching (and am able to find), and giving them a percentage based on how I, personally, felt about it. I'm tired of seeing Rotten Tomatoes and their scoring system, and seeing YouTube reviewers with their own thoughts (like Jeremy Jahns, DeadMeat, Penguinz0, The Nostalgia Critic, Chris Stuckmann, etc.), and much more. Because I always feel like my own thoughts are just...different. I'm not a hipster, and I promise I'm not an idiot. But I pay close attention to every movie I watch, I think about them fully and how they made me feel, and...I'd say 90% of the time, I end up disagreeing with the majority. And it really makes me wonder if I just have bad taste, or if I just see things that others don't. I don't know.

But, anyway, I felt brave enough to post my full movie rankings on here for all to see, even though I know that anyone who sees my list will laugh their heads off and mock me profusely for my tastes. I just watched the 2024 movie 'Y2K', so that motivated me to come on here and post my full (current) list! Just as a preview for my kind of tastes, here's how I score things:

100% - Not possible. Nothing is perfect. Absolutely nothing. No matter how 'perfect' something may be, it's not. It was made by humans, and humans are all flawed. And there's always, ALWAYS going to be SOMEONE out there who doesn't like it, and their opinion is valid. So nothing will ever be 100%.

90% - I don't do anything between each ten percentages; I like to keep things even. But, a 90% from me means that the movie is pretty much 'perfect' as 'perfect' can be. It checked all my boxes, was fully entertaining, and I pretty much have no qualms with it in terms of my own enjoyment factors. 

80% - Mostly great movie. Had to take off 10% due to some minor thing that bugged me, but otherwise it was still a great movie that I have high praise for. 

70% - This is where 'Y2K' ended up falling for me. I removed 10% due to it not being as scary as I hoped for, and then another 10% due to the constant drug use, the constant swearing, how unlikable most of the characters were, and how cringey everyone was. So, two issues brought it down from 90%. 

60% - A movie with some decent entertainment value, and I ultimately felt it was a bit better than average, but not by much. Probably pretty bad by most standards, or something that everyone else loves that I simply don't...yet I grudgingly give it a decent score anyway simply because I acknowledge its strengths.

50% - A fully-mixed movie. Not horrible, but not great. A lot I didn't like, but it kept my attention enough for me to not hate it, either. 

40% - An annoying movie that has a lot wrong with it, but it has just enough decent moments that kept me vaguely entertained that it's not even worse. 

30% - Movies where even I notice how bad the CGI is, how painful the acting is, how the story makes no sense, and other issues that I tend to not really notice like everyone else does. When a movie is THIS bad with these things...I have to rank it pretty low.

20% - Basically, movies that aren't pure trash that are just...well, you can't even finish. For a movie to be 20%, it at LEAST has to have a tiny...TINY shred of something interesting that I enjoyed, despite everything else being so painfully bad for me.

10% - They made a movie. That's more than what a worthless loser like me could do. So they have to get SOME score that isn't 0%. But that's all the praise you get...because what you DID put on film made me want to jump off a cliff. 

0% - Just like with 100%, this score is impossible. No matter how much you may hate something...it can't be 0%. Because they still put SOME level of effort...SOME hours of work...SOME attempt...to make a film. And while some would say 'They shouldn't have even tried!', I'm not that cruel. So, NOTHING is 0%. 

So, now that you got my scoring system...enjoy my current list! Also, these are NOT all the movies I've seen in my lifetime. These are just the ones I've watched online over the past several years and felt like keeping score of. See how many of these movies you recognize.

dune2,dune part two,1jh7446,Edward G. Robinson Appreciation Post,"Hi, guys!

Well, my today's movie watching day was a chaotic one. Watching Soylent Green (1973) was a long overdue, but how that went from futuristic antiutopia (2022, lol) to classic noirs is a mystery to myself. Namely, Double Indemnity (1944) And, well, by the end of this I discovered something bizarre. What do those two films that are three decades apart have in common? Yeah, I know, the title spoiled it, but still. By pure coincidence the two movies I spontaneously decided to watch share an actor, Edward G. Robinson. And, well... He's great

Soylent Green doesn't really give his character a lot of screentime, but when it does - he did his part perfectly. To me he selled the idea of a man crying over a cut of true natural beef. Not because he got it and he's happy, but rather because the world went down so bad it's even a problem to get some meat in the first place

And then there's Double Indemnity. Oh, boy, Barton Keyes is awesome. An insurance investigator with a passion and a knack for statistics and finding inconsistencies and other ""oddities"". Dude radiates passion and charisma and this makes watching him such a treat. I seriously don't want to spoil much, but his position as protagonist's friend AND almost a central antagonist is a masterclass of suspense IMO

Can't really vouch for Soylent Green since while it's a good movie, to me personally it was a bit boring. But Double Indemnity? Absolute yes! It's a gem. Not only as a time capsule, but also as a movie in general.  Anyway, it was bizarre. Realising I was looking at the same person 30 years apart. Even more bizarre because if I understand correctly 40's was Edward's peak and Soylent Green was his last role because he died of cancer just three months after he completed filming it...",13,12,1742645727.0,2025-03-22 12:15:27,False
dune2,dune part two,1jgxofp,What makes a great movie? Friday vs One of Those Days,"I'm watching ""One of Them Days"" with Keke Palmer and SZA. It's obviously a little bit of an homage to Friday (Female Friday?), but it's still a decent standalone film. SZA did surprisingly well, and Keke was charming and funny as always. 

The story was good too. Laugh out loud funny in some parts. Cute in others  And with a little heart too. However, I don't think it will have the same impact as Friday. But why? What makes a movie iconic, and a ""classic"" like Friday? And not as much for Days? Was it just iconic lines, memorable scenes, a breakout role? Was Friday just lucky? Was it groundbreaking? 

And their take home also shows that Friday made a bigger impact. Days took home $50M. That doesn't sound like a lot, but it had a budget of just $14M. The movie almost quadrupled it's budget. It made a good return for investors. That is really good, especially in this day and age. 

However, Friday had a budget of $3.5M and took home almost $28M. It took home almost 8 times it's budget! 

And Friday is still quoted to this day. I doubt Days will be quoted at all.

So, what's the difference between the two? Word of mouth? Funnier script? Funnier actors? Lightening in a bottle? Or just a sign of the times? ",1,7,1742608422.0,2025-03-22 01:53:42,False
dune2,dune part two,1jgvtv3,The Brutalist - questions about a scene in part 2 (not THAT one),"Near the end of part 2, when Erzebet is in pain and almost out of her medication, Laszlo decides to inject her with his heroine as a painkiller. This leads to a bedroom scene between the two, and subsequent developments soon after, that I found hard to interpret. 

1. Why did Laszlo cover Erzebet's face with material while they were in bed? Was he thinking of suffocating her to put her out of her misery? Was he trying to depersonalize the experience to feel like he wasn't with his wife? Was it out of shame? If the latter, wouldn't he have covered his own face instead of hers?

2. After Erzebet ODs and survives, she's shown going to Van Burren's, on her feet for the first time in the film - albeit using a walker. Are we to believe somehow the drugs led her to have some kind of breakthrough? Did anyone else find this unrealistic and odd? 

3. Do you think Erzebet became addicted to heroine like Laszlo after this one time and it played a role in her ultimate death?",0,6,1742602829.0,2025-03-22 00:20:29,False
dune2,dune part two,1jfdl21,When was it decided to cut Kill Bill into two volumes ?,"I always heard that they decided to do it after it was already made because of the length. But the two films have such wildly different styles— Volume 1 is like a super fast paced, live action manga adaptation or anime, a grind house leaning revenge film. Vol 2 is more like a spaghetti western, slower (but never boring ), more dialogue heavy, with only one fight scene. The asian styled influence of the whole film is almost entirely taken out, which makes sense since O-Ren is out of the picture. Actually, most of the style of the first isn’t really carried over into the second, save for the chapter titles, and a few visual clues here and there (like the alarm sounding zoom in when she sees one of the members of the squad). 

While both films complement each other  perfectly , they still feel like two very different movies , like QT approached both as such from the beginning. The splitting up of the story feels very deliberate, not feeling like he just randomly found an ending or an appropriate scene to divide the two films. 

So , was Tarantino told the films would be in two parts after he already wrote it, and then he tweaked both films to have their own unique look and feel? It seems like it was always supposed to be Vol 1 and Vol 2. Just curious. 

Also will we EVER get The Whole Bloody Affair ? I’ve seen some clips of it (like the Crazy 88 fight in color) , and I’ve read a lot about it over the years, with hints we’d get a release and still nothing. I thought maybe with 4k we’d finally get the other cut, but they just released Vol 1, so I guess it’s not happening any time soon? Bummer. ",0,11,1742434131.0,2025-03-20 01:28:51,False
dune2,dune part two,1jf4q2q,'Disney's Snow White' - Review Thread,"Director - Marc Webb  
Starring - Rachel Zegler, Gal Gadot, Andrew Burnapp, Martin Klebba, Ansu Kabia

*A beautiful girl, Snow White, takes refuge in the forest in the house of seven dwarfs to hide from her stepmother, the wicked Queen. The Queen is jealous because she wants to be known as ""the fairest in the land,"" and Snow White's beauty surpasses her own.*

**Rotten Tomatoes:** [47%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/disneys_snow_white) (Rotten)

**Metacritic:** [47/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/snow-white/) (Mixed or Average)

Some Reviews:

[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/snow-white-review-rachel-zegler-gal-gadot-disney-1236167607/)

>Webb proves equally adept at romantic interludes, attack scenes and production numbers, notably the joyous finale, “Good Things Grow,” with the entire cast outfitted by Powell in resplendent white. Sure, those poorly integrated CG little people take some getting used to, but this is the type of wholesome and uplifting family entertainment that comes directly from old-school Disney DNA.

[Awards Watch - Erik Anderson \[C+\]](https://awardswatch.com/snow-white-review-rachel-zegler-is-the-fairest-of-them-all-in-marc-webbs-fairytale-remake-c/)

>*Snow White* is more clearly made for children than most of the other Disney live-action remakes, and its focus on being a fairytale helps with that goal. This is a simple story that anyone can understand and enjoy, with a cheer-worthy lead and some catchy, if unmemorable, new songs. The film threads the needle about as well as it possibly could, which is impressive even if it doesn’t mean the film is actually great. You may not be whistling on your way out of the theater, but at least watching *Snow White* doesn’t feel like work.

[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/snow-white-review-rachel-zegler-gal-gadot-1236340753/)

>You could say that we’ve seen other fairy-tale rulers a lot like this one. Yet movies connect in mysterious ways. Who would have thought that a Disney live-action remake could seem this pointedly political? In the end, the most resonant romantic feeling “Snow White” leaves you with may be: Someday my chintz authoritarian will come tumbling down.

[FandomWire - Manuel](https://fandomwire.com/snow-white-review)

>Rachel Zegler is the heart and soul of this film. Not only does she deliver an impressive vocal performance, but she also radiates charisma and emotion in every scene. Her Snow White is fearless, fair, brave, and true like she should be, elevating the character to a new level of sophistication. It’s disappointing to see how many people will leave outside influences to shape their perception of her work because this is, without a doubt, one of the most memorable performances of the year from one of the most talented actresses of her generation.

[Independent (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/691) \- [Clarisse Loughrey \[1/5\]](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/clarisse-loughrey)

>With Snow White, they’ve finessed their formula -- do the bare minimum to make a film, then simply slap a bunch of cutesy CGI animals all over it and hope no one notices. The film’s prince, played by Andrew Burnap and, for some reason, called Jonathan, is essentially Disney cannibalising itself, as he has the same thief backstory and curtain bangs as *Tangled*’s Flynn Rider. There’s self-cannibalisation at work, too, in Sandy Powell’s costumes, which are dour replicas of their animated counterparts. At times, Zegler’s bob leans dangerously close to “little Dutch boy”. What’s most disheartening about it all is how predictable Disney’s choices have become.

[The Daily Beast - Nick Schager](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/snow-white-review-disneys-worst-live-action-catastrophe-yet/)

>From a strictly political standpoint, it provides a more enlightened portrait of female independence. Such a nominal improvement, however, proves inherently incompatible with its source material, and the resultant awkwardness defines this misfire, whose every duplication is underwhelming, and whose every alteration is less a move in the right direction than a step on a face-smacking rake. No Magic Mirror is needed to identify it as the lamest Mouse House re-do of them all.

[Guardian - Peter Bradshaw \[1/4\]](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/19/snow-white-review-live-action-musical-rachel-zegler-gal-gadot)

>Those otherwise estimable performers Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot are now forced to go through the motions, and they give the dullest performances of their lives. Here is a pointless new live-action musical version of the Snow White myth, a kind of un-Wicked approach to the story and a merch-enabling money machine. Where other movies are playfully reimagining the backstories of famous villains, this one plays it straight, but with carefully curated revisionist tweaks.

[RogerEbert.com](https://www.metacritic.com/publication/rogerebertcom/) \- [Nell Minow](https://www.metacritic.com/critic/nell-minow/)

>Some parts of the film work better than others, but none of it has the sweetness and imagination of the animated feature. This “Snow White” is not the fairest of them all. It’s just, well, fair. The other core elements of any version of this story are all present here, with varying degrees of success. Near the top is replicating Disney’s version of the iconic magic mirror that answers the question about fairness (the mirror for “Sydney White’s” nemesis is the online campus popularity poll). This one is close to the 1937 film’s design, familiar to Disney fans through many appearances in various productions, from the “Wonderful World of Disney” series of the 1950s, when it was voiced by Hans Conried, through the popular “Descendents: Wicked World” series of 2015-17.

[The Film Verdict](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/4059) \- [Alonso Duralde](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/alonso-duralde)

>Like so much of contemporary fantasy cinema, Snow White exists in a weirdly artificial netherworld, and not just where the seven dudes are concerned.

[AV Club](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/833) \- [Jacob Oller](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/jacob-oller)

>For every attempt to replicate majestic shots from the original or to give them a bit of technological oomph (perhaps most effective as sunlight breaks through Snow White’s fearful first trip through the forest), there is a spurt of modern quippiness that pulls the audience in the other direction. It’s a disorienting take on a film whose success relied as much on its elegance as its beauty, and yet, thanks to sunny songstress Rachel Zegler, there is a talented throughline still obvious amidst the mess.

[New York Magazine/Vulture](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/334) \- [Alison Willmore](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/alison-willmore)

>*Snow White* is, for better and (mostly) worse, a product of a corporation that has for years been lumbering after its idea of the zeitgeist with all the agility of an aging colossus. That, in chasing something vaguely progressive and YA-inspired with *Snow White*, Disney has turned out a film with some hilariously timely choices is a great joke, though I wouldn’t call it an intentional one. The most pragmatic aspect of Snow White is that with its plasticky set design and gift shop tacky costuming, it already looks like it takes place in a theme park — no adaptations necessary.

Once the best of friends, petty jealousies and a series of betrayals place them on a deadly collision course that will reshape the Mafia (and America) forever.*

>He’s more than capable of handling the daunting assignment — he’s De Niro, after all — but the net effect is ultimately so gimmicky that it saps the movie of its intended seriousness. It’s a fatal miscalculation that consigns *The Alto Knights*, Levinson’s first theatrical film since 2015’s *Rock the Kasbah*, to being a footnote in the distinguished careers of both its director and star.

[Chicago Sun-Times](https://www.metacritic.com/publication/chicago-sun-times/) \- [Richard Roeper](https://www.metacritic.com/critic/richard-roeper/)

>De Niro infuses Costello with a kind of avuncular charm, while Genovese has the fiery temper and paranoid fury to match Jake La Motta in “Raging Bull.” It’s a privilege to witness one of the best actors of all time, still at the top of his game.

[AwardsWatch](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/3094) \- [Karen M. Peterson](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/karen-m-peterson)

>With its central gimmick and insistence on telling about events rather than showing them,*The Alto Knights* might have made a moderately entertaining television movie. If expanded and brimming with more detail, development of other characters, and a deeper examination of the similarities and differences between its two leads, this could be a fascinating limited series. Instead, we are left with a lethargic acting exercise that ties together a few good scenes with a string of uninspired exposition.

[Next Best Picture](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/3046) \- [Cody Dericks](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/cody-dericks)

>Apart from some decent performances, “The Alto Knights” is unexciting and fails to make a case for its existence. The story is dutifully told via exhausting narration from Frank in a way that makes it seem like not even he is fully invested in telling it.

[Guardian](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/205) \- [Peter Bradshaw](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/peter-bradshaw)

>There is a kind of solidity and force to the film in its opening act, but its interest dwindles and we get little in the way of either ambition or moment-by-moment humour. There is, however, a sweet, autumnal touch when the melancholy, ageing Frank is forced by his wife to take their dogs for a walk in Central Park in mink coats to keep out the cold.

[Empire](https://www.metacritic.com/publication/empire/) \- [Laura Venning](https://www.metacritic.com/critic/laura-venning/)

>*The Alto Knights* seems to be aiming for an elegiac tone similar to that of *The Irishman*, nostalgically mourning both a lost time and a neglected film genre. But it finds its groove in its sillier moments, most memorably a farcical sequence of ageing mobsters trying to flee an al fresco meet up in upstate New York where they’ve been cornered by the cops. It’s hardly a return to the golden age of gangsters, but it’s always a pleasure to see De Niro toast his rivals’ downfall.

[Slashfilm](https://www.metacritic.com/publication/slashfilm/) \- [Chris Evangelista](https://www.metacritic.com/critic/chris-evangelista/)

>I suppose there's something comfy and cozy about ""The Alto Knights"" — it's the type of sleepy dad movie that can easily be watched from a worn-in armchair through half-closed eyelids on a rainy afternoon. The type of movie your father naps through and then says ""It was okay"" after you ask him how it was. In other words, there's nothing offensively bad about ""The Alto Knights"" ... but you kind of wish there was, because at least that might've made the movie more interesting.

[The Daily Beast](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2345) \- [Nick Schager](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/nick-schager)

>Not wanting to proceed with Frank and Vito is a relatable feeling throughout *The Alto Knights*, whose dawdling pace is almost as extreme as its over-the-top acting. Everyone involved is doing fourth-rate mobster schtick, led by De Niro in lead performances that allow him to squint (and double squint) in virtually every frame.

[IndieWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/226) \- [David Ehrlich](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/david-ehrlich)

>Levinson’s film is too busy laying the past to rest to bring it back to life, and “The Alto Knights” is never flatter or more overfamiliar than when it’s doing the things that should feel like gimmies to a well-heeled gangster film. It’s almost as if Frank can’t fathom why anyone today should care about the incredible true story of how some enterprising immigrants without a nickel to their names formed a multi-billion-dollar racket that shaped a huge part of 20th century America. The tragedy of “The Alto Knights” is that Levinson can’t either.

[Collider](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/1982) \- [Aidan Kelley](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/aidan-kelley)

>It's a real shame that *The Alto Knights* doesn't explore its real-life story as thoroughly as it should have, as there is a genuinely interesting story to tell here. The film details historical events that didn't just dramatically impact the shadowy world of organized crime, it changed the public perception of the Mafia forever. *The Alto Knights* perhaps would have been better served if it had been a documentary narrated by one Robert De Niro instead of a meandering feature film that stars two.

[Independent (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/691) \- [Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/clarisse-loughrey)

>Pileggi’s screenplay and Levinson’s scattershot direction, like De Niro, make little out of the clash of ideologies at the film’s centre. What could be biblical, feels passionless. We spend almost no time with the men in their younger, fonder years. Sure, *The Alto Knights* might provide double the De Niro, but you could easily achieve the same effect by playing *Goodfellas* and *Casino* on two screens side by side. It would be about as cohesive an experience.

>If there was any doubt as to De Niro’s greatness, it’s laid to rest in these face-to-face confrontations. No star could’ve held his own quite so effectively against De Niro. These surreal staring matches reach beyond the two characters, encompassing the full range of a filmography from which there seems to be no retirement, just bold late-career risks from a professional gambler.",11,39,1742400684.0,2025-03-19 16:11:24,False
dune2,dune part two,1jezabh,Phantasm,"There's a fair amount of Horror fans here on r/Movies and there must be more than a few who are familiar with this series. One of my very favorite Horror series if not my outright favorite, mainly purely based off of the first two although I also think the third and fourth ones were pretty good as well (and also quite impressive despite their small budgets). The first two always see regular rotation from me every October as part of my Halloween playlist. The Tall Man is definitely among the more unique of the Horror icons and he was played to perfection by the late, great Angus Scrimm throughout all five. The series is such a great blend of surrealism and mind-bending Horror with some fun Action elements sprinkled throughout. And who doesn't love the iconic flying death spheres.

May as well rank them while I'm at it. For other fans here, how would you rank them? Mine goes:

* Phantasm II
* Phantasm
* Phantasm IV: Oblivion
* Phantasm III: Lord Of The Dead
* Phantasm V: Ravager

2 has always very easily been my favorite of the series. It's literally not only my favorite Horror film, but one of my favorite movies in general. With the bigger budget you can tell so much more was able to be accomplished. It's like a vintage Survival Horror video game from the 90s as a movie. Just a riot of a movie. I have a lot of love and respect for the original as well, but it's always hard not to look at 2 as being the definitive entry.

3 and 4 are also very good, but the fifth was sadly held back by the clear lack of a budget, but you can tell they tried their damndest. I will say as a lifelong fan the ending of 5 certainly hits hard and brings full-circle the themes of death and loss, which have been prevalent since the first film. It also certainly hits much harder in light of the health issues series star Reggie Bannister has sadly recently suffered. I'm just glad a fifth and final film was finally made after so many years of waiting.",6,4,1742397188.0,2025-03-19 15:13:08,False
dune2,dune part two,1jef86d,Mortal Kombat II: Should Cole Young Die or Evolve? - A Discussion on Character Development,"The notion that good writers should simply kill off poorly received characters is, in my opinion, a common misconception in the world of film and television. In reality, skilled writers often take on the challenge of improving and developing these characters, transforming them into compelling additions to the story.

Consider the case of James Norrington from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Initially introduced as a somewhat one-dimensional character, Norrington underwent significant development in the sequel, becoming a more complex and intriguing[^(\[1\])](https://www.looper.com/156256/characters-who-were-much-better-in-the-sequel/). This transformation demonstrates that good writers can take a lacklustre character and breathe new life into them, rather than simply writing them out of the story.

The idea that ""if they're good writers, they'll kill him"" is fundamentally flawed. As renowned screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, points out; ""Every good screenwriter that I know of spends an awful lot of time rewriting""[^(\[2\])](http://www.screenwritingisrewriting.com/quotes-on-writing--rewritng.html). This sentiment applies not just to dialogue and plot, but to character development as well. Good writers understand that characters, like real people, have the potential for growth and change. To back this up, Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of Top Gun, Black Hawk Down, and, Pirates of the Caribbean said, ""If you don’t fall in love with the character you’re lost.  I don’t care how big the explosions are.""[^(\[2\])](http://www.screenwritingisrewriting.com/quotes-on-writing--rewritng.html) This underscores the significance of investing in character growth rather than simply eliminating poorly received characters, even if through fantastical methods.

In the case of Cole from Mortal Kombat, simply killing him off in the first few minutes of the sequel would be a missed opportunity. Instead, skilled writers would see this as a chance to flesh out the character, address the criticisms from the first film, and potentially create a compelling arc that could surprise and engage audiences.

It's worth noting that some of the most beloved characters in film history have undergone significant rewrites and development. For instance, the character of Ahsoka Tano from Star Wars: The Clone Wars initially faced strong criticism as an ""annoying brat"" when introduced in the 2008 film. However, over the course of the animated series and beyond, Ahsoka evolved into a fan favourite, with her character growth and complexity winning over audiences[^(\[3\])](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/pd4avj/comment/hanjvi8/). This transformation from a widely disliked character to a beloved one demonstrates the power of skilled writing and character development in storytelling.

In a franchise like Mortal Kombat, where death is often just a portal to another realm, character development becomes even more crucial. As Ed Boon recently hinted, ""There are ways to bring dead characters back""[^(\[4\])](https://www.cbr.com/mortal-kombat-2-how-kano-return/). This unique approach to mortality in the series underscores the importance of evolving characters rather than simply eliminating them. By investing in character growth, Mortal Kombat can create richer storylines and deeper connections with its audience, ensuring the franchise's longevity and continued success.

So, while it might be tempting to call for the elimination of poorly received characters, such as Cole, true writing uses the ability to transform these characters into integral parts of the story. As the audience, we shouldn't demand the death of a character as a quick fixes that ultimately rob us of a potentially rich story; but should instead be open to the possibility of character growth and redemption so that the series can evolve and grow.",0,28,1742330209.0,2025-03-18 20:36:49,False

75. Heat: 8/10. A small army of great performances and characters that had me rooting for both teams. Henry rollins jumpscare!

dune2,dune part two,1jcyjcc,"Without the love story, this would've been a good movie.","I saw Battleship for the first time today. I enjoyed Pacific Rim and to a lesser extent, Atlantic Rim. Battleship came before both of them, and without the love story, it would be a good movie. The movie starts with a late 20s young male who's crashing on his brothers couch and the two of them are at a bar celebrating his birthday. He wants a blonde, who wants a burrito, so he breaks into a store to get it for her and gets tazed twice giving it to her. Back at the house, the brother tells him that he's going to make him join the navy. Next thing you know, he's an O3 officer. It's ridiculous that not only would the navy not let him in, no officer recruiter would recruit him. The movie sets it up like he's been a slacker up until 28 with $12 bucks to his name and then on top of that, he just got arrested. Not to mention he's not only a commissioned officer, but has advanced twice from an O1 to an O3. And on top of that, he's in the fleet, stationed with his brother. If this part of the movie had been cut out of the script, Battleship would be a good movie.",0,4,1742166792.0,2025-03-16 23:13:12,False
dune2,dune part two,1jcav66,"Training Day, my thoughts.","# Training Day

What is a movie star? A movie star is someone who can sell a movie. There are few people out there that are true movie stars. About two weeks ago I wrote about Cast Away and a true movie star performance by one of the biggest movie stars of our time. Tom Hanks is one of our best movie stars and can sell a movie. If a movie was coming out, and you were told it had a guy who owed the Russian mafia money, so he, as a dirty cop, kills a drug dealer and steals his money and then sets up a new trainee to take the fall, but when it doesn’t work out, hires a Mexican gang to kill him, but the trainee gets out if because he picked up a wallet of teenage girl he rescued from being raped in an ally earlier that day while accidentally high on PCP, and it started Tom Hanks, I would totally watch it. The only way to make it any better, would be to have it star the best movie star of our time, Denzel Washington. He is handsome and charismatic and can act alongside the best. If a movie has Denzel, I will watch it, and it’s almost guaranteed that I will enjoy watching it. Training Day is the movie I described above, and it would be a mess of a movie if not for the fact that it stars Washington.

Training Day is a movie that, even though it has a wild, unbelievable plot involving crooked cops, Russian mafia, and L.A. gangs, is one of the best movies of the century. One of the biggest selling points to any movie is the cast. Andre Romell Young (a.k.a. Dr. Dre) plays a part as a dirty cop in Washington’s crew. I love Dre, but this is the only part miscast, but towards the beginning of the movie when driving around the streets, Dr. Dre’s ‘Still D.R.E’ is used perfectly. Also on the track raps Cordozar Calvin Broadus Jr (a.k.a. Snoop Dogg). Snoop makes an appearance as a wheelchair bound paraplegic crack dealer, which sounds crazy, and is crazy, but is executed to perfection. I’m a little surprised Snoop hasn’t had a bigger career acting in movies. Scott Glen kills it as an ex-cop turned drug dealer. Cliff Curtis as a gangster and his whole poker playing crew are perfect, and the use of Cypress Hill exquisitely sets the atmosphere of their neighborhood. Macy Gray, although a bit over the top, acts in her scene perfectly. Lastly, the actual protagonist of the movie, and (although not to the level of Washington) movie star Ethan Hawke’s performance perfectly encapsulates a good cop, trying his damnedest to do the right thing in this world of corrupt police.  
  
The best aspect of this film is, as you can probably already guess, Denzel Washington and his character Alonzo Harris. Alonzo is a bad guy, and the movie doesn’t hide it. When we first meet Alonzo, through the first few scenes of the movie, the tactics he uses as a narcotics officer might seem okay. Sure, you let the little guys go in order to catch the big time criminals. Don’t waste time booking a few guys attacking a teenage girl and let her gangster cousins sort it out. Street justice is justice. Hey, maybe Alonzo isn’t that bad, maybe he has a point. But then there are aspects that tell you otherwise. He holds a gun to the head of the rookie trainee and tells him to smoke drugs. Drugs the trainee thinks is just weed. Only after he smokes and feels bad does Alonzo fill him in that he just smoked PCP and lies to him, telling him he didn’t have to smoke it,  not like someone was holding a gun to his head. Then he kills Scott Glenn’s character and along with his crew, make up a scene to help them get away with killing him and stealing his money. Sure, Glenn was a drug dealer that was a poison to the community, but Alonso is a bad guy too. The worst comes once Alonso decides that Ethen isn’t cut out to be a dirty cop and hang out with his crew. He pays a gang to kill him, and only by luck does he not end up murdered. I hate Alonso as a person, but since it is Denzel playing him, I still like him just a bit.  
  
Villains create great characters. Some of the most iconic characters are villains. This is why I believe that Denzel is the top movie star of our time. Although Tom Hanks is great, I could never really imagine him in the Alonso role. But if there exists an alternate universe where Denzel plays the main character of Cast Away, I could believe it, and it might end up even better than the original…maybe.

dune2,dune part two,1jc8c2m,Review of the films Veronica (2017) and Sister Death (2023),"I want to start by saying that I watched Veronica because I already had in the back of my canon to watch it for its intriguing REAL story since I've always been a fan of this kind of stories based on real events (I like them but far from me, thanks xD) and honestly it caught my attention.

After this, when I finished watching it I discovered that it had a second part (a prequel) and I thought “no shit, now I will have to see it if or if” because Veronica left me with a bitter taste in my mouth but I loved how the story was told and it seems lie but with very little budget Paco Plaza made a very complete horror movie and with many details, and with what I like not to end up understanding what is happening, well yes, but you could say that it went beyond instead of a “normal” ende.

Veronica is a movie filmed in a town in Madrid in 1990 and you could say that it does not have an incredible cinematography but to be honest it fulfills the task and to me the story of Veronica fits me a lot because at no time it made me tired maybe the first day it made me slow since the film is told three days before what happened, but the moment Veronica goes to Sister Death the film begins to take a more interesting course for the viewer. Without deciphering much of the movie I can say that you are not going to freak out about it but the interesting thing about the movie is how simple it is in many ways telling the simple life of Veronica a girl who is in charge of her siblings during most of the day since her mother is always away from home, Veronica has an ending that links perfectly with the beginning (small spoiler although it is not that spoiler).

Now talking about Sister Death I want to say beforehand that I thought I was going to end up liking it more because at the time where it is told and the cinematography that I could sense it was a slower but more beautiful film. To start from the beginning it seems to me a film with a very good staging either of the actress who plays Narcisa as where it was filmed a place you could say nice but inside the site gave me very bad vibes the truth. The story takes place in Spain after the post-war 1947, tells how Narcisa decides to enter a convent because she is tired of being asked multiple questions about her powers in her town and obviously decides to enter the convent, the story from the beginning could be said as in Veronica does not have much plot only the nuns of the convent welcoming Narcisa, although it has small details that make you nervous, not fear but small incongruities. I want to emphasize that Sister Death also has “similarities” to Veronica as it is told in three chapters and that in my opinion I found it interesting because it marks you when the story is getting more mysterious, it bothered me a little, but I also think that I did not think to see the same as in Veronica because there it is clearer what happens, if I had to highlight any of the three chapters obviously I'll stay with the last “Sister Help” although the second chapter also has interesting and intriguing moments.

To differentiate with the movie Veronica I think I spent more “terror” in that one since it has more macabre things and more of a conventional horror story than Sister Death so you can say that I had a better time in the sense of terror, But come on when I finished watching Sister Death I could say that I was right with what I thought because I thought I would like it more and indeed I liked it more and it seems strange because I did not have the same feeling as with Veronica but Sister Death goes further is a story that involves you completely in the story of Narcisa as everything revolves around her and her events in that convent is terrible but beautiful at the same time, just say that the end is quite different from the end of Veronica that by the way I also liked the fact of being both different endings. An incredible ending.

To mention the main actresses of these films Sara Escacena (Veronica) and Aria Bedmar (Narcisa), she played a role bordering on excellence, a small mention also to Sara Roch (Rosa) one of the girls of the convent in Sister Death.

And obviously to Paco Plaza who executed two quite different films with similarities but following a very well shaped and very well made timeline.

dune2,dune part two,1jc7hft,I know these two franchises has nothing to with each other and are two totally different genres but...,"There are a lot of parallels between them. Psycho and The Karate Kid, despite being two completely different franchises and having abolutely nothing in common and both being made 24 years apart. They both originally had four films, with the fourth film in both franchises being completely different from the previous three. They both got followed up with a shot for shot remake (Well, Karate Kid 2010 wasn't a 100% shot for shot remake but, some scenes were) and that was followed by a TV spinoff/reimagining, several years later. Yes, one is horror and the other is a coming of age but the parallels are so uncanny. Both Bates Motel and Cobra Kai both might be better than the films that came before them, or at least that's debatable. Although CK is better than most of the TKK sequels. Haven't seen Bates Motel, though.

Ironically, 1986 shares the same year with both Psycho III and The Karate Kid, Part II. Never seen Bates Motel, but loved Cobra Kai. I do think Psycho II-IV are better than The Karate Kid II-IV, but the 2010 remake of TKK is way, way better than Psycho '98.",0,28,1742079520.0,2025-03-15 22:58:40,False
dune2,dune part two,1j9ol69,Actors/Actresses with Academy Awards for performances in different languages from one another,"A few days ago I wondered: has someone ever won two (or more) acting Oscars where their winning performances are in different languages from another? An example since this sentence can be a bit clunky: I win Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor in 2026 for a performance in English, and then Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor in 2029 for a performance in Spanish.  

As afflicted with ADHD as I am, I decided to research it myself. From what I gather, two individuals have accomplished this: 

- Robert De Niro, for his Sicilian performance in The Godfather Part II, and English performance in Raging Bull
- Christoph Walz, for his majority German, French and Italian performance in Inglourious Basterds, and English performance in Django Unchained *(I’m guesstimating on the proportions of each language he speaks in IB, but even if a majority of his lines are in English I think the amount of the other languages he speaks clearly counts in the spirit of the criteria)*

In looking this up, I saw that many more performers were nominated for such performances but didn’t have victories for two or more separate languages: 

- Ingrid Bergman (won for three English performances, nominated for three English performances and one Swedish performance)

dune2,dune part two,1j8z7lu,Can we talk about how absolutely absurd Face/Off is?,"I'll begin by saying that I am not referencing the premise of the movie. Of course, the technology presented was too futuristic but that's beside the point. I'm referring to the insane plot choices that had me cackling throughout the playtime. This wasn't even close to my first time seeing Face/Off but below are some of the things that made me realize how dumb (still a fun watch) this movie really is. 

  
1.) Although they make it clear that it's not only Archer's face they will be changing during his secret procedure, I don't think they emphasized that every single aspect of his outward appearance would be changed. You see him get his scar removed (back to this later) but Troy was sleeping with Archer's wife while wearing his face. That would imply that they either have the exact same sexual anatomy, his wife is completely clueless, or they surgically made Archer's body identical to Troy's. 

2.) Throughout the entire film, Archer and Troy shoot thousands of rounds at each other, try and blow each other up, etc. While I get Archer wanted revenge, the two of them clearly didn't care if they were going to get their real face back as I can't imagine the surgery they both received would be able to just fix a shot up face. If their goal was to get their identities back, firing bullets with little to no aim seems like the wrong approach. 

3.) Speaking of the shootout scenes, the FBI gives ZERO fucks about children as seen when they raid Troy's friends hideout. Adam almost got shot in every part of that scene. 

4.) Random callout but with hindsight, having Danny Masterson play the guy who assaults Jamie was a bad call. 

5.) The absolutely most absurd part of this entire movie was Archer's starting motivation and the ending of the movie. Clearly, Archer's vendetta against Troy was due to Archer's son being killed. When he goes in for his first surgery, he asks to not have his scar removed as it reminded him of his lost son and the reason he was doing the secret assignment in the first place. Cut to Archer meets Adam, Troy's biological son, who reminds him of his boy. Adam's mom dies, Archer kills Troy, yada yada. When Archer is finally getting his surgery to get back to his normal appearance, he says he doesn't need the scar back anymore. Fine. A little strange seeing as how important it was at the beginning of the film but maybe Troy being dead will help him and his family move on and remember his boy together. Then you cut to Archer returning home to his family and realize he's been making this essentially random kid (Adam) wait on the porch for him to call him in and announce him as their replacement son to the family's delight.

dune2,dune part two,1j7p8sg,"If you can go back in time and change film history, what would you do?","Here's what I would do in order from least important to most important:

* Prevent the existence of underwhelming sequels like ZOOLANDER 2 and DISENCHANTED or change them for the better. I give their respective originals a 7/10 while their sequels are basically a 6/10. But, there are times when I wish they never existed. I would prevent them from ever happening especially after so long in-between films or help the studios find a way to make them better. Similar thing with INDEPENDENCE DAY yet I still give both movies a 7/10 and still hope that someday we gat an ID3.
* I would convince Francis Ford Coppola to cast Johnny Depp in BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA as Jonathan Harker instead of Keanu Reeves. FUN FACT: Winona Ryder suggested the part of Harker go to Johnny Depp before Francis stupidly went with Keanu. This movie is my favorite R-rated horror movie even though I give it an 8/10. If the movie had the great JD as Harker, it would've been higher.
* Convince everyone at Disney and Walden Media not to give the rights to THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA to Fox 2000 Pictures for the third movie. Personally, as someone who loved Disney since I was very little, I always thought that whatever franchise started at Disney should stay at Disney. Then again, I would say that whatever franchise started at a certain studio should've stayed there permanently. Better yet, I would've figured out a way to convince Disney to make the NARNIA movies similar to the way Warner Bros. made the eight HARRY POTTER movies. Closer together in production and release and not far apart like the NARNIA movies. That way, Disney would've made eight successful NARNIA movies.
* I would convince Disney from the 90s onward not to make direct-to-video sequels to their movies because those DTV follow-ups that I've watched as a kid ruined any enjoyment of their respective originals. If the studio wanted sequels, they should've been made at the Walt Disney Animation Studios for the big screen and not DisneyToon Studios for home video. Same thing with the direct-to-video sequels to movies like THE CROW (1994), OPEN SEASON, SURF’S UP, and BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA. I would remove them from existence. Granted, I still enjoy those four movies because I’ve never seen their sequels though I still had a glimpse of their trailers.
* While I'm at it, I would stop Disney from replacing the classic blue “Walt Disney Pictures” logo with the modern “Disney” logo in newer releases of their older movies.
* I would also convince Disney to never alter the studio name from ""Walt Disney Pictures"" to just ""Disney"". They've been doing that since 2011 and I find it incredibly disrespectful to Walt's name. I liked the modern WDP logo from 2006-2011, but I would remove the ""Walt"" and ""Pictures"" from it.
* Convince the people at Warner Bros. to keep some of the deleted scenes from the two DEATHLY HALLOWS movies like Harry's final conversation with his abusive family and adapt more moments from the books like some of the moments with Remus and Tonks' son, Peter Pettigrew's death, the inclusion of Dean Thomas and Viktor Krum, having the final fight in the Great Hall like in the book, everyone cheering for Harry when it's over, Luna Lovegood helping Harry recover from his fight, and putting the Elder Wand back inside Dumbledore's tomb. There should've also be a moment in Snape's death scene where he apologizes to Harry, Ron, and Hermione for treating them like shit as a way to fully redeem the character. Plus, I would've also convinced the studio to add text epilogue regarding the fates of supporting characters and villains in between the Battle of Hogwarts aftermath and epilogue. Also, the final movie should've had a beautiful end credits song like the Annie Lennox song ""Into the West"" from THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING with a montage of clips from all eight HP movies. That would've these movies a LOT better.
* And finally, I would convince everyone at Sony to let Sam Raimi have full creative control of SPIDER-MAN 3. I love that movie, but if Sam had his way, it could've been better. More importantly, I would convince them to continue making SPIDER-MAN 4 with or without Sam Raimi because why would they cancel it if it's just the director who left? The cast was ready. Sure, they wouldn't have made it in time for 2011, but they could've tried for 2012. I have nothing against THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN movies, but they're not as great as the OG trilogy. Worst of all is that they cancelled TASM3 and other planned movies while TASM2 ended with unanswered questions and cliffhangers in order for the studio to share the Spider-Man rights with the stupid Marvel Cinematic Universe to the point where they made a MCU multiverse story called NO WAY HOME… effectively ruing my childhood. Plus, the so-called Sony's Spider-Man Universe has not been going the way I want it too. It makes you wander would have of this have happened if Sam just had full control and if they didn't cancel the planned second trilogy for Tobey Maguire? God, I miss the early 2000s.

Anyway, those are all my two cents on what I would do if I had the power to change film history. Let me know what you think and tell me what you would do if you had this power?",0,67,1741576270.0,2025-03-10 03:11:10,False
dune2,dune part two,1j6wmq8,What if Mubi distributed Fixed?,"So recently, I talked about the release situation of Genndy Tartakovsky's upcoming film *Fixed*, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ioxbg3/about_the_release_situation_genndy_tartakovskys/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). I recommend reading this before reading this post, but for those who don't know, *Fixed* is an upcoming R-rated 2D animated film from Sony Pictures Animation. It stars Adam Devine, Idris Elba, and Kathryn Hahn and follows a dog who has 24 hours before he gets neutered. The film (completed in late 2023) was set to be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures with New Line Cinema attached to the film, however, on August 9, 2024, WB and New Line dropped out of the film as part of cost-cutting measures by Warner Bros. Discovery. **But**, SPA got back the distribution rights, and the film was being shopped to other distributors. The last update we got on *Fixed* was in late 2024. In an interview with Collider's Steve Weintraub, Tartakovsky said: ""We're looking for a distributor. It's not dead by any means. Sony has it and so they're looking for somebody to distribute it. It's a kind of unicorn. It's a 2D animated, rated-R film, and so they're trying to find the right partner in a world where they don't even make rated-R comedies, live-action, for the most part. It's hard to find somebody to believe in this thing, but I feel like we're getting closer and closer. So, the status is it's not dead. It's not shelved. It's finding a partner to release it.""

[Adam Devine stars as dog protagonist Bull.](https://preview.redd.it/f9qk3fea9kne1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d7a2cc35507fee605e7851711c166da6fb09d7f)

In my post about *Fixed*'s release situation, I stated that it shouldn't be hard for Sony Pictures to release it themselves, whether it be under Columbia Pictures or Tristar Pictures (mainly Columbia), the main reason being that it's a film from their **own** animation studio...

...but today, I have another suggestion: what if Mubi distributed the film?

Why Mubi? Well, I bring up on behalf of the recent success of a film they've distributed: *The Substance*. Originally, Universal Pictures greenlit and was to distribute the Coralie Fargeat-directed film, but it dropped out. Behind the scenes during post-production, there was a screening of the film in which three Universal executives attended. Two were male, and one was female. One of the male execs hated the film and demanded it recut (although Fargeat had contractual final-cut privilege). Because there was no recut, Universal dropped the film from distribution. However, Mubi acquired the film, and it released on September 20 of last year. It got critical acclaim and was an awards contender. It also grossed over $77 million worldwide according to Box Office Mojo/The Numbers or over $82 million according to *The New York Times* on a budget of either $17.5 million (according to [Deadline Hollywood](https://deadline.com/2024/09/box-office-transformers-one-the-substance-never-let-go-1236095371/)) or $18 million (according to [Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/global/the-substance-coralie-fargeat-oscars-1236289808/)).

So, I believe that with the success of *The Substance*, Mubi could be a contender for *Fixed*. However, there are caveats. Mubi is mainly a streaming service, and it is also an independent distributor (like Neon and A24). *The Substance* is their [first film to be distributed theatrically in the US before hitting the service](https://variety.com/2025/film/global/the-substance-coralie-fargeat-oscars-1236289808/). Besides, not only is it a 2D animated film (2D animation is unfortunately seen as less viable when compared to 3D animation in the film industry), it's an animated film **in general**. A lot of times, animated movies picked up by independent distributors in the US are given limited theatrical releases and/or gross a small amount of money. Examples include *Robot Dreams* (Neon), *Memoir of a Snail* (IFC Films), and *Flow* (Janus Films/Sideshow). Anime isn't safe either. If I remember correctly, Disney gave Studio Ghibli's films limited releases in North America. The only exceptions I can think of in which independent distributors give animated films wide releases are with Focus Features and the Laika films they've distributed and Fox Searchlight Pictures with *Isle of Dogs*. (I know that Focus and Fox Searchlight are part of the bigger Universal and 20th Century Fox (which is part of Disney) respectively, but they are the specialty/independent film units of their respective studios, so they still count.

But, to wrap up, after the success of *The Substance*, I believe that Mubi could (maybe) be a contender for *Fixed*.

dune2,dune part two,1j5lhw8,Nickel Boys - Review,"Nickel Boys was probably the strangest entry into the Best Picture category at this year's Oscars ceremony. There wasn't much hype surrounding the film before its nomination, and even after it seemed to fly under the radar in discussions surrounding the award season.  
Although I don't think it's good enough to deserve its nomination, it does make some interesting creative choices and wouldn't have felt out of place in the editing or cinematography categories.

Directed by RaMell Ross, the film takes place in Florida during the Jim Crow era. It tells the story of Elwood Curtis, an African-American teenager who gets sent to the abusive reform school Nickel Academy, where he befriends fellow student Turner. During their stay at the academy, the two boys both witness and fall victim to the various abuses perpetrated by the school administrators. Elwood is the more idealistic out of the two, believing that his situation can change if the school's abusiveness is exposed. Turner, on the other hand, is more of a cynic who simply wants to keep his head down and stay out of trouble.

This could be an interesting dynamic between the boys if it weren't for the fact that Elwood's idealism comes across more as naivete. Before he was sent to the school, he took part in civil rights activities and should be more aware of the injustices in America at this point in time. He was sent to the academy after being wrongfully convicted of car theft, and seems to have the belief that the system that put him there in the first place is going to free him as well.

While its plot might not be spectacular, it's the way in which the story is presented that sets it apart from what you might have seen before. The film is shot from the first-person perspective of its two main characters, a decision that ends up being its greatest strength, but also its greatest weakness.  
The first-person POV style of cinematography works best when the film relies on simple visual storytelling. Many shots look beautiful, and paired with the film's editing and narrow 1.33:1 aspect ratio, each scene evokes the feeling of something like a faded memory, which suits the story perfectly.  
A personal favorite moment was early in the film, where it cuts from a Martin Luther King speech to a simple shot of Elwood looking at his arm. It was easy to understand that this wasn't just a shot of someone looking at an arm, but more specifically looking at his skin color.

The sad reality though, is that this style of filmmaking doesn't work as well the minute somebody starts to talk. Seeing everything from the eyes of the main characters means that during dialog scenes you're treated to actors looking straight into the camera lens while talking. It comes across as creepy, off-putting, and even amateurish at times. Not to mention that it becomes a lot harder to connect with the main characters when we can't see their faces.  
This isn't so much of an issue in scenes between Elwood and Turner as the camera angle switches between both of their perspectives, but the result of that is a fairly boring shot-counter-shot style of editing with the added ""feature"" of seeing both characters stare right into your soul as they speak.

Although the cinematography, editing, and overall structure of the film are really interesting, I feel that this type of filmmaking would be better suited for a more minimalist film that didn't rely so much on dialog. It's worth a watch for anyone who's curious about the creative decisions taken in the film, but as a whole I don't think it's very good.  
It's a big swing and a miss, but I'm curious to see more from director RaMell Ross in the future.",0,3,1741347383.0,2025-03-07 11:36:23,False
dune2,dune part two,1j5gtgf,Any Updates on S. Craig Zahler's upcoming film?,"I am just curious, but is there any updates on S. Craig Zahler's Upcoming film or if it's still happening, The Bookie & The Bruiser.

To Summarized from Variety, The Bookie & The Bruiser follows a pensive, Jewish fellow named Rivner and an oversized Italian-American tough named Boscolo from the Lower East Side, both of whom served overseas during WWII and returned changed men who no longer fit inside the lives they’d left behind. Uninterested in taking orders from bosses or playing by the rules of polite society, the two friends partner up as a bookmaker and an enforcer and create an illicit gambling operation that proves to be very profitable, though risky, and their situation gets rather sticky when they find themselves stuck between a powerful Irish gang and the Mafia.

This film was supposed to shoot back in the fall with Vince Vaughn and Adrien Brody in the lead roles. However, from what I read, filming was pushed back to the spring, in large part because of The Brutalist picking up momentum & surging in the Awards Season, thus making Brody unavailable. But so far, it has been quiet. I hope Zahler makes this film, but I hope this project wasn't cancelled.

All in All, does anyone have any updates?

dune2,dune part two,1j3ji5o,Novocaine Sneak Peek Screening.,"No spoilers as the movie isn’t out yet. 

Last night, 3-3-25, I went to a sneak peek of the upcoming Novocaine, starring Jack Quaid and Amber Midthunder. 

Novocaine is Jack Quaid as Nathan Caine, a millennial-ish assistant manager of a bank who has a genetic condition which renders him unable to feel pain of any kind. 

The movie is a typical r-rated, gross out, action/rescue movie. If gory bodily harm violence messes with you, you may want to think twice about this one. Jack Quaid, looking more and more like his dad each day, is the main guy in the movie and is basically doing his Hughey character from the Boys. The movie is full of late 90s-early 2000s quips, a guy is brutally injured in a horrific way and then it’s “*Soooo, THAT just happened*….” kinds of jokes. 

The movie isn’t super clever for the most part, but it does move pretty quickly at a little under two hours. 

One thing that they completely missed is that regardless of whether or not an individual can feel pain, the human body can only withstand so much damage before it just shuts down. That was a little weird, but they did find some rather creative ways to to do funny bodily harm to people in this movie and if you’re a fan of gruesome Zombieland or Crank style murders, then you’ll get a kick out of this movie I suspect.

dune2,dune sequel,1jy1w5y,"Why do people hate remakes, sequels, and prequels so much—even when some are actually decent?","It feels like any time a remake, sequel, or prequel gets announced, the reaction is instant negativity. People roll their eyes, say “Hollywood has no ideas,” or write it off before a single trailer drops. And yeah, we’ve definitely seen our share of soulless cash grabs—but at the same time, not all of these movies are disasters. Some are genuinely solid, or at least doing something interesting, even if they’re not perfect.

Blade Runner 2049 and Doctor Sleep were both surprisingly strong follow-ups to iconic originals. Creed and Creed II managed to breathe new life into the Rocky series while carving their own identity. Dune (2021), technically a remake of the 1984 version, was widely praised for making dense material accessible and visually stunning. And Puss in Boots: The Last Wish shocked a lot of people by being genuinely great—and far better than anyone expected from a Shrek spinoff sequel.

There are also good sci-fi remakes that don’t get talked about enough—like Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011), which rebooted a tired franchise with real heart and sharp commentary, or The Fly (1986), which took a B-movie premise and turned it into a body horror classic.

Then there are the ones that didn’t land. The Mummy (2017), The Lion King (2019), and Pinocchio (the Disney+ version) all felt like hollow retreads with none of the charm or soul of the originals. Space Jam: A New Legacy leaned hard on nostalgia but ended up feeling more like a brand showcase than a story. Even Matrix Resurrections had some cool ideas but left a lot of fans cold.

What I find interesting is that we’ve always had sequels and remakes—Temple of Doom and Return of the Jedi weren’t as critically praised as their predecessors, but they’re still loved. So why does it feel like newer ones get judged more harshly right out of the gate? Are we just more cynical now? Tired of reboots? Or is it that a lot of these movies really are just creatively bankrupt?

I’ve got my own thoughts, but I’m curious what others think. What are some remakes, sequels, or prequels you think were unfairly hated—and which ones absolutely deserved the backlash?",0,17,1744527943.0,2025-04-13 08:05:43,False

**42. Lisa Frankenstein - 3.75/10** 

Great aesthetics, but a total mess. Felt like three different scripts mashed together. Incomprehensible character arcs. Really enjoyed the first thirty minutes or so, which made the second and third acts all the more disappointing and confusing.

**41. They Called Him Mostly Harmless - 4/10** 

An Instagram reel worth of info spread out across 2 hours.

**40. Stopmotion - 4/10** 

Booooring. I like stop motion, and it is a cool concept to base a horror flick around, but it’s never used in a particularly interesting way. I think the director thought the concept of stop motion animation was in and of itself much more creepy than it actually comes across. There is VERY limited usage that felt interesting/unsettling, but it’s a section that only lasts about a minute. Slow burn and the payoff is nill.

**39. Juror #2 - 4.5/10** 

Not a fan of the way Eastwood usually writes dialog. Felt like a soap opera. Similar to *12 Angry Men*, it’s a “grown up” legal drama that expects you not to really have an understanding of the way juries work. Which is fine, but the on-screen happenings have to be interesting, and this was far from that. Very impressed that he's still making movies though!

**38. Love Lies Bleeding - 5.25/10**

Well done and well acted with some cool symbolism/surrealistic elements woven in, but I just didn’t find it to be an interesting enough story. Never felt invested or hooked. And, even though it is very slowly paced, the dynamics between characters still felt rushed. Liked the style but not the substance - loved the sound design especially. Still, a slog.

**37. Emilia Perez - 5.5/10** 

A potentially special movie marred by a steady stream of kind of baffling errors. There were parts I loved, but the parts that were bad were sophomoric to a point that it was hard for that not to be the main takeaway. Selena Gomez is the perfect representation of what is wrong about this movie. Not only is her acting and accent work absolutely terrible, she seemingly doesn’t even know how a number of the words she’s speaking are supposed to be pronounced. How does a movie with the pedigree and aspirations of this one not course correct something like that?When the film’s at its best, it has this ethereal, beautiful quality to it - like something out of a dream. A number of songs I loved, but more I hated. Some beautiful moments followed up by something so obvious and trite it had my eyes rolling out of my head. A film in extremes.

**36. Maxxxine - 5.75/10** 

Kind of a mess. Very disjointed plotting without a particularly satisfying arc. I do love this character, but it seems like they ran out of material for her.

**35. The Beekeeper - 6/10** 

I love how constant the bee talk, references, and puns are. You’d have thought the studio would have noticed that the line “I’ve got to protect the hive” was repeated ten times in the first 45 mins and told them to turn it down, but this is not that kind of movie. It’s a little too serious to be a full-on parody, which I do think holds it back. Probably would have been a fun short film, gets a little boring.

**34. All We Imagine as Light - 6/10** 

Beautiful, poetic writing, but this thing was pretty brutal to get through. Painfully slow. Appreciated the themes of class consciousness, religion, and sexuality/love in Mumbai, but it just did not hold my attention at all. If you’re into slow cinema, I could see it working for you.

**33. Deadpool and Wolverine - 6.25/10** 

Rewards a lot of inside baseball knowledge of superhero studio politics. I found myself going “oh, I get that” way more than actually chuckling. A lot of references presented as jokes, and even the jokes that were in the movie didn’t really land with me. I did enjoy the relationship built between the two leads. Action was all low or no-stakes.There is an homage to the *Oldboy* hallway scene towards the end, which was more visually interesting than most of the action, but not enough to get me on board. I just think *Deadpool’s* not for me.

**32. Tuesday - 6.25/10** 

Wanted to love it. Beautiful premise/visuals but very strange tonally. Some awkward millennial “so random” kind of humor. Would have worked better if it were more focused on the individuals involved and their relationship. I found *A Monster Calls* to be a much better version of this sort of story.

**31. The Brutalist - 6.25/10** 

Had the aesthetic of a great American epic, but not the substance. Like a kid playing dress-up. I could feel that the director was trying to make an “important” movie - and though I do appreciate the ambition - it felt contrived. Didn’t feel at all new or inventive.Also quite shallow; there were a number of interesting potential story threads, but most were either unexplored or abandoned. The passing of time felt rushed in a way that sometimes meant that we skipped past potentially interesting moments. Very (I’d say comically) dramatic acting without enough actual drama.The score - though underused - was fantastic and the shots really were beautiful and inventive. I did appreciate how unique the story structure was, and how well it would have worked had the material been better. First half was quite a bit better than the second.

**30. Nosferatu - 6.5/10** 

Disappointing; my most anticipated of the year. Can’t overstate how beautiful this movie is to look at. Every frame could be a painting. Unfortunately, it’s so high octane, there’s not space for dread to be built, and it all becomes noise.Characters are constantly - and I mean constantly - acting absolutely terrified. Felt like a beautiful, artsy *Michael Bay* horror flick. The acting style is also clearly intended to mirror the pre-*Brando* “showy” style of acting, but feels distracting and off-puttingly anachronistic in a movie that looks as cutting edge as this one does.

**29. Furiosa - 6.75/10** 

Some cool world-building stuff that I enjoyed, but may have worked better as a TV show to dive deeper into those dynamics. The action sequences felt very glossy and uninspired; huge downgrade from *Fury Road*. This would have been a solid “It’s on TNT, let’s just throw it on” kind of movie from fifteen years ago.

**28. Longlegs - 7/10** 

Nick Cage’s character is the only real standout; he rides the edge of ridiculous and terrifying so well. A bit of a bore outside of his performance, but totally serviceable horror flick.

**27. Woman of the Hour - 7/10** 

Pretty okay! A serial killer movie, where the horror on screen was communicated much more through the way the women were intimidated and demeaned on the way to being killed than the actual kill itself. I didn't feel quite so hit over the head by the message as something like *Promising Young Woman; I* felt like it was mostly handled quite effectively. 

There were definitely some moments - mostly later in the movie - that made me roll my eyes a bit. The scene where *Anna Kendrick* is actually on the show felt like pretty uninspired wish fulfillment. The main character's someone with modern values who gets to clap back at the bad guys, which I find to be a fairly common - if not quite manipulative - way to make the audience feel like the good guy without delving deeper into why things were the way they were in that time. There's a scene towards the end of the movie that really was remarkable in how tense it was; reminded me of some of the better scenes from *Zodiac*.

**26. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice - 7.25/10** 

A bit soulless, but still has some fun moments and cool visuals. Seems like Burton had maybe four different ideas for what he wanted the sequel to be and couldn’t pick any.Monica Bellucci’s role is especially undeveloped and strange. I wish that it had leaned into the weird or over-the-top elements a bit more than it did.

**25. My Old Ass - 7.25/10** 

Sweet little movie. Fun premise and great performances. Not enough forward momentum.

**24. Hundreds of Beavers - 7.25/10** 

Some very fun and funny stuff, but I would have enjoyed it more as a short than as a feature. There’s a reason *Looney Tunes* cartoons aren’t two hours long.Always fun seeing the novel ways indie filmmakers can work around low budgets.

**23. The Wild Robot - 7.5/10** 

Pretty good. Felt very much like a children’s flick, which it is, but didn’t transcend those bounds in the way that a *Monsters Inc.* or *Toy Story* do.All about not fitting in and being yourself, which is basically every children’s movie. Might just be that I’m old and cranky.

**22. Oddity - 7.5/10** 

Solid horror movie with an A+ beginning. Some really creepy imagery.

**21. Didi - 7.5/10** 

Good coming-of-age flick, but I don’t love coming-of-age movies. Clearly very personal to the director. Didn’t resonate as much with me.

**20. Late Night with the Devil - 7.5/10** 

Fun horror flick with a pretty unique setting. Maybe a bit milquetoast, but overall enjoyable.

**19. Kinds of Kindness - 7.75/10** 

Three short films. Might have enjoyed them more individually, as they start to run together a bit. Quite funny and very weird.

**18. I Brake for Caterpillars - 8/10**

Great dark comedy written and directed by my chess buddy, Ken Green.

**17. Dune: Part Two - 8/10**

Beautiful visuals; really does feel epic. I think this movie would work better if viewed immediately after *Part One*, as it can sort of take your breath away with how constant the action is.On its own, it feels like a theme park ride more than it does a film; again, an issue that goes away if marathoned. Villains felt shallow.

**16. Hit Man - 8/10** 

Very fun. Glen Powell oozes charisma. Great range too, came away very impressed by him.Felt like there were some tonal issues where it didn’t know if it wanted to be serious or silly. Quite enjoyable overall.

**15. Caddo Lake - 8/10** 

A puzzle to put together as much as it is a movie. Little context for what’s happening until about an hour through, which made it hard to really feel invested in what was going on. It was very well executed and an interesting premise/mystery, but it does take some concentration, and it was easy to get overwhelmed or confused. The character work all felt great and real.

**14. In the Land of Saints & Sinners - 8/10** 

Great *Liam Neeson* action (adjacent) flick. I saw a lot of parallels between this and *Unforgiven*, though this movie was quite a bit softer.Neeson can chew scenery like no other, and Joffrey was great too. Feel like I can see him being a more buttoned-up *Barry Keoghan* type. Could have used a better group of villains and did feel a bit slow in spots.Surprised by how beautiful this movie was to look at and how much care they put into composition.

**13. A Different Man - 8.25/10** 

Thoughtful commentary on identity and personality. Some subtle *Lynchian* stylings, which I appreciated. Could have been trimmed down.

**12. Speak No Evil - 8.25/10** 

Wonderfully tense. *James McAvoy* may be the best working actor today.Really interesting premise, explores how people are so willing to be polite that they’ll ignore very obvious red flags so as not to ruffle feathers. Really enjoyed the twists and turns (which are totally ruined if you watch the trailer).Feels like logic flies out the window a bit towards the end. One of our protagonists comes out seeming cartoonishly competent and the other cartoonishly incompetent.Curious now to watch the 2022 original.

**11. Strange Darling - 8.25/10** 

Absolutely love the style. Twisted and twisty; keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I love the way that - from the very beginning - the structure makes you feel off balance (the film says it’s 5 chapters and then starts with chapter 3).Female lead was fantastic. Very weak final twenty minutes or so. Not sure if I agree with the film’s overall message/politics.

**10. The First Omen - 8.25/10** 

Very effective satanic horror flick with some really disturbing and interesting set pieces. Legitimately creepy; on par with the original in that regard.Could have benefited from cutting about 30 minutes towards the end. The final act suffers from showing too much and not leaving enough to the imagination.The end was the only section that really felt overtly “fan-servicey,” but it was so overt and awkward that it felt like a post-credit scene in a *Marvel* movie—very weird and silly in this context.Overall, a very good movie that could have been a classic if they had just chopped off the final act.

**9. The Substance - 8.5/10** 

Very fun body horror flick, led by a great performance by *Demi Moore*. Very interesting concept.I didn’t feel it in the moment, but I can see how there are moments that could be really emotionally resonant for certain people watching—all about an unwillingness to deal with aging and the pain that comes with fading beauty. Love how disgusting the camera work makes everything feel. The close-ups of *Dennis Quaid* eating may have been the grossest parts of a very gross body-horror movie.Really interesting how the film satirizes “sex sells” by making the sexual imagery SO over the top. They do some interesting stuff at the end, but I do think it could have used some editing down.The final act of the film lost a fair bit of momentum due to being so drawn out. I’m also tired of the “everything devolves into violence” trope; feels like a cop-out at this point.

**8. Wicked: Part One - 8.5/10** 

Didn’t really want to see it; I saw it on stage and thought it was just okay. Thought it was quite slow to start, but was totally invested by the end.Loved the look and effects. Didn’t feel stretched out. The pauses in the songs all felt natural and cinematic to me. Don’t love the music overall, but a few stood out. *Ariana Grande’s* a great comic actress, and the woman playing *Elphaba* has one of the more expressive faces I’ve seen; she was the perfect actress to get you to feel what she was feeling. A spectacle.

**7. Conclave - 8.75/10** 

Very well acted and shot. Not high art, but a super entertaining/fun political thriller.A lot of the conflict in the film felt small in a way that made everything feel much more grounded and real. I did appreciate the messaging, even if some of the moralizing could feel on the nose.Excited to watch this one again.

**6. Baby Reindeer - 9/10 (Limited series that felt like a 4-hour movie, so here it goes)** 

Loved how raw this felt. Not a conventional story at all with a uniquely imperfect protagonist.Its four-hour runtime really does allow it the space to make what might feel corny or melodramatic in a 90-minute film feel earned and heartbreaking in this one.Incredible performances all around. *Courtney* and I were glued to the screen the whole time.

**5. I Saw the TV Glow - 9/10** 

A movie I enjoyed thinking about as much—or more—than I enjoyed actually watching. Profound. Presents likely the best metaphor I’ve come across for existential dread and living through a life you’re not supposed to. Maybe transgenderism?(Later edit: I’ve since read that the director is trans and explicitly says that it is about the trans experience.)Very open to interpretation; stayed with me for weeks. Some really stunning visuals. Could have dull moments, but much more than the sum of its parts once it all comes together and likely the most important movie I will see this year.

**4. A Real Pain - 9.25/10** 

A fairly typical road-trip dramedy that feels very *Odd Couple meets Garden State* until about halfway through, at which point it becomes something new. In one of the more powerful single scenes I’ve watched, all of those genre tropes are suddenly shifted and subverted, and it becomes a uniquely vulnerable look into the psyche of the magnetic/difficult personality type.*A Real Pain* chooses to look at its characters with a seriousness and introspection that’s really uncommon. Maybe a little too much Chopin—got distracting.

**3. Red Rooms - 9.25/10** 

One of the most physically uncomfortable thrillers I’ve ever watched, with one of the all-time most disturbing single scenes—all the more noteworthy that it’s done without actual violence or gore depicted.An exploration of how dehumanizing and perverse true crime as a genre and hobby can get.

**2. It’s What’s Inside - 9.25/10** 

Has a distinct pop aesthetic that feels very “of today” and exciting. Incredibly stylish and fun.Kind of a low-brow concept on paper, but it’s taken as far—and in as many directions—as you could imagine it could be.Doesn’t take the easy, low-hanging fruit to engage your interest. On paper, the plot and premise are quite complicated, so it’s impressive just how easy it all is to follow in practice.

**1. Anora - 9.5/10** 

Might be a perfect movie. Begins beautiful and idyllic—like a music video suddenly becoming reality—and turns into something equal parts heart-wrenching and hilarious; a wildly entertaining deconstruction of a fairy tale.*Sean Baker’s* most traditionally staged film—definitely not shot on an iPhone this time—but still doesn’t lose the soul that his grittier pictures have.Great naturalistic dialog that allows the chemistry of the cast to take center stage. Love how *Baker* shines a light on people on the margins of society without judgment; he doesn’t glorify—this isn’t *Pretty Woman*—but he doesn’t cast stones.

dune2,dune sequel,1ibmpun,What Films from 2024 Will People Actually Remember in 30 years?,"With Oscars nominations recently announced, we're talking about 2024 movies quite a lot, and it might seem like they will all be as equally ""popular"" for the rest of time. But that can't be true. There are certain movies that endure, that remain in the zeitgeist, that become culturally significant, after successive generations. Others, for better or worse, fade to obscurity over time, at least among the general population.

So. What movies from 2024 will we still be talking about in 30+ years?

My picks:

* Dune: Part 2 - This may very well go down as one of the greatest Sci-Fi movies of all time, especially if Messiah does well and Denis' career continues on its current trajectory.
* Wicked: I wasn't a huge fan, but the Broadway play has obviously endured and I suspect the movie (and its eventual sequel) will inspire new fans. People, including kids, will be singing these songs for a while, I think.
* The Substance: It will go down as one the most shocking, gruesome, and intense (body) horror films of the last 20 years, maybe the 21st century? It will never be *hugely* popular, but it will be one that is always on the minds of movie fans and one that regular people say ""Oh yeah I've heard of The Substance. Wasn't it super fucked up?"" a-la The Thing and The Fly.
* The Brutalist: I'm not sure about this one, as it's unfortunately not more popular. But I think in some circles it may go down as one of the best, grandest, most poignant American epics ever made. Not quite The Godfather or Lawrence of Arabia, but maybe close?
* The Wild Robot: Another one that I wasn't a huge fan of, but another one that was well-liked and appealed to both adults and children. I could see this being the kind of movie people are excited to show their kids one day.
* Challengers: Despite not getting any(!) Oscar nominations, certain people really, really loved this one. It's got a bit of everything and I think is pretty rewatchable, so I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes the kind of movie that people put on when they don't know what else to watch.
* You could maybe throw Inside Out 2 and Flow in here too (appealing to both kids and adults), but I think The Wild Robot is the more likely to be loved by many for years to come.

I'd wager most other films from this year will be regarded as good to great, but will probably not *endure*. They'll be the kind of movies that if you haven't seen it, you haven't heard of it.

dune2,dune sequel,1huhjm0,What Upcoming Film Are You Most Excited About in 2025?,"As we head into 2025, there’s a lot of buzz about some major movie releases on the horizon. From long-awaited sequels to ambitious original projects, it feels like every genre has something exciting to offer. Personally, I can’t wait for Dune: Part Three because of Denis Villeneuve’s incredible vision and the stellar cast lineup that promises to bring the saga to an epic conclusion.

What’s on your must-watch list for the year? Are you looking forward to a blockbuster spectacle, a heartfelt indie gem, or maybe a movie you think will fly under the radar? Let’s discuss what have you counting down the days to its release!",3,80,1736111767.0,2025-01-05 21:16:07,False
dune2,dune sequel,1hrdoo0,2024 is such the weird year of movies.,"There’s have been a writer strike and got ended last 2023. Many films got delayed including MCU movies. Dune Pt 2 is the best and popular film last year. Challengers is also so good. Conclave as well that I didn’t expect it that is a PG Rated film. Wicked is the best musical of 2024 I’ve ever seen. Fall Guy was underrated but peak cinema. Furiosa is great and some best film but a box office bomb. There’s isn’t many Comic book movies releasing in 2024 and they most failed except for Deadpool and Wolverine(extremely peak cinema). Joker Folie à Deux is the most anticipated film of 2024 and they just failed as a sequel musical. Animated films are alright with The Wild Robot and Inside Out 2 except with Moana 2(I haven’t seen it yet).  Kung Fu Panda 4 is good and mid(not as good first 2 or 3) Despicable Me 4 is very mid and leads to box office success. Flow is very interesting. Transformers One is so great and good but not sure why it’s a box office failure. Much spinoffs and sequels releasing in 2024 like Quiet Place day one, Gladiator 2(The first one is better), Alien Romulus, and Mufasa. Kingdom and the planet apes seems the best sequel and spinoff film of 2024. Fuck the Godzilla x Kong movie(weird film) Twisters is so underrated(much country music assshit). Bad boys 4 is a great and peak action film. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice is the most sequel nostalgia of Halloween lovers. Sonic 3 is the peak video game cinema of 2024. 
A24 and Neon did much of some good films like Civil War, Longlegs and Love lies bleeding. Heretic is my favorite. But so many Horror movies releasing in 2024 like Smile 2, Terrifer 3 and Speak No evil. Thriller films as well like Trap and Blink Twice. I havent seen Nosferatu yet there’s many people said it’s a peak horror film of 2024, and I’m going to watch today. The Substance is the top 5 films and the number one horror film of 2024 but it’s really much disturbing including the ending. Not sure to rewatch it lol. Anora is alright, there’s a chance to win Academy Award but this movie have much sexual content and some drugs in the movie that I’ve ever seen. Ending of Anora is so very satisfying, sadness and a bit disappointing. The Brutalist did came out last year and didn’t have the wide release yet. Same with Nickel Boys. Should be the best 2024 movie and could release in 2025. 
I hope 2025 cinema will be better than 2024. 2026 is so stacked with films. 

Top and best 5 films of 2024 that I have seen are Challengers, Dune Pt 2, Anora, The Substance and Conclave. ",0,4,1735768666.0,2025-01-01 21:57:46,False
dune2,dune sequel,1hr5rsg,"This year, I watched over 365 movies. Here's an assortment of favourites, surprises, and thoughts.","So, why did I decide do this? Short answer: Twitch streamer Northernlion and Cine2Nerdle Battles, the former a movie trivia machine, and the latter a movie-trivia PVP game. Hoping some folks are familiar with both or either as explaining makes this giant post even bigger. Anyway, those got me to finally make a Letterboxd, and set me on a movie frenzy which peaked in early January. So I figured I'd try and get through a year's worth. One a day was already kind of out the window as I started late, but 365 seemed surprisingly doable given the appetite I suddenly had for it (and sure enough I went over). There were so many classics I hadn't seen, recent beloved movies I didn't get to see in theatre, etc. Hilariously, I actually thought I'd ""run out"" of the best stuff before the year was out, but of course that's patently absurd, especially with some of the choices I made. I suppose I should apologize up front for the anime movies too, which some might consider boorish to count, but what the hell, I wanted to see them. I ended up with 391 movies new to me, including 11 rewatches, mostly to show my wife or prepare for a sequel. 

That all said, I don't recommend this. It's easy to burn out and just really not be in the mood some days when you're stuck on such a goal. There were some days I put on a movie I knew I wouldn't be too concerned about, and I'm sure you can notice them. And really, I only had the luxury of time to do this since my backshift job allows me a lot of downtime, so yes, I know I'm blessed there. It'd be downright unreasonable otherwise. Anyway, hopefully someone enjoys this read, and maybe discovers a movie they were unaware of or watches something they've been putting off. But really, I wanted to make a post like this also just for me, as something of a year-end review, to go back and recap everything since it can be easy to forget with such a deluge. So I won't feel too bad if this goes unnoticed, as I kind of suspect.

But enough about all that. [Here's the Letterboxd Diary of what I've seen this year.](https://letterboxd.com/PureLionHeart/films/diary/) Out-front note, I didn't give star scores, as I always hate looking back and being utterly embarrassed by younger me's choices. So I just noted whether I liked it or not, and added my favourites to the appropriate list. I'll mainly use this post to showcase my Top Ten, a list of the surprises both good & bad, and some random musings on actors, directors, genres, whatever. And don't worry, I don't believe there's any spoilers here.

*Top 10 (alphabetical):*

* **Anatomy Of A Fall** - Just an utterly fantastic drama and mystery. There's really not much more I can say, save that Sandra Huller is fantastic and I hope to see her in a lot more.
* **Asteroid City** - Turns out I love Wes Anderson's work, and this one has enraptured me for reasons I can't really articulate. I still think about it, and devoured YouTube essays as a result.
* **Coherence** - Thrilling, and a fabulous ending. I had heard it was insanely confusing to understand, but highly disagree, unless you're trying to track everyone, which the movie really points out itself as foolish. The book was real heavy-handed, though.
* **Dune: Part Two** - Just an amazing follow-up. I've not read the books, but I know I am actively failing the material every time I'm cheering for Paul, but so be it. And God-damn, Austin Butler was amazing with the subtleties. He could not have been hornier for Paul, and I'll stand by that viewpoint.
* **Hell Or High Water** - Heard good things, but didn't expect such a great, tight plot acted so well. Chris Pine was great, sure, but Ben Foster is the real treat. Been keeping an eye out for his work since.
* **Locke** - This should not have worked, but dammit, does it ever. Any movie that has me cheering at the end is an all-timer. I was on the edge of my seat since so much could have gone every which way.
* **Take Shelter** - I discovered Jeff Nichols' work this year, and loved all but The Bikeriders. This one had me uneasy all the way through in the best way. And yes, I'm one of those folks who subscribes to the ending being another dream/episode. 
* **The Hunt** - Damning, depressing, terrifying stuff. More a horror movie than most films I'd watch. Especially as it goes on and things just don't improve. Drives home the ending all the further. Mads' best work, and I say that despite adoring Hannibal.
* **The Vast of Night** - The biggest surprise of the year, probably my overall favourite just on sheer unreadiness. For all the movies I liked this year, nothing gave me the outright chills except this and Coherence, and this was an order of magnitude stronger. Why such a surprise? I thought I was about to watch It Comes At Night, and had the wrong movie. If there's one absolute recommendation in this entire post, it's this movie. Easily.
* **Women Talking** - My wife could not have undersold this more. She liked it, and broadly explained it as the women taking a vote about what to do with the men of the town. That's it. I assumed something supernatural, as she's much more into horror and the like. The actual content was much more harrowing and enthralling.

*Surprises (Good & Bad):*

* **The Vast Of Night** - One more shout-out, because my God. Expected a likely mediocre horror, got a feature-length Twilight Zone episode that kept me enraptured the whole way through.
* **The Ballad Of Buster Scruggs** - So wildly inconsistent, wow. My fault, I didn't know it was an anthology. I could have watched two straight hours of Tim Blake Nelson singing and shooting, and Near Algodones was still good, but the rest did little for me (maybe The Mortal Remains). Not helped by the fact my wife decided to get high to watch it with me during the Buster Scruggs section, and then got subjected to the nightmare that is Meal Ticket at her peak. The poor woman.
* **Tar** - The wife and I actually gave up on this early on in the classroom section as it seemed too esoteric for us, with no knowledge of the subject matter, but I gave it another crack myself later in the night, then eventually convinced her to go back. So fantastic once the movie fully revealed itself. And I cannot stress enough how surreal it was that just earlier that day, and for the past few weeks, I had been replaying Monster Hunter World...
* **The Hunt For Red October** - I just find it hilarious they had English, Scottish, Swedish, and New Zealander actors doing Russian accents...
* **The Killing Of A Sacred Deer** - This was my first Yorgos Lanthimos film, and nearly put my off his whole filmography. The plot is fantastic, but I utterly loathed the monotone delivery throughout. Thank goodness he's loosened up on that. I couldn't imagine Poor Things without the over-the-top deliveries like Ruffalo's.
* **Sicario** - Good enough movie, but man does it feel unusual for Denis Villeneuve in retrospect of his later work. I also bring this up because I dared to try the sequel and quit less than 10 minutes in when they added Muslim suicide-bombers to the Mexican cartel, and it was blindingly clear the intention and views of the film and filmmakers.
* **Moonrise Kingdom** - My wife and I were struggling on what to think of this for a decent chunk of runtime, until we finally settled on a description of immense sincerity. We loved it by the end and were actively rooting for everyone.
* **Ad Astra** - What little I heard about this was as a boring, dull, sci-fi movie. I don't get it at all. Hell, there's a car chase with guns on the moon! And in a spaceship taking off! But who cares, because the contemplative acting and dialogue are the real point, and it's great at that.
* **Kiss Kiss Bang Bang** - This movie is an enigma to me because from the sum of its parts, it should easily be one of my all-time favourites. I adored The Nice Guys, for example. But I swear, I just couldn't get into it. It just never seemed to come together for me, and I just don't know why. I may rewatch it again, maybe I was just in a bad mood or something.
* **Mud** - I knew of this solely from Cine2Nerdle and getting beaten with it, and it was my intro to Jeff Nichols as mentioned. I generally don't care for coming-of-age films, but this one was fantastic with the way it approached a boy learning of love in so many different ways. Take Shelter did more for me, but this was very nearly in my Top Ten as well.
* **Furiosa** - I'll just be honest, this was a let-down for me. Still good, undeniably, but Fury Road is a masterpiece and this just couldn't measure up. Surprisingly, I think one of the biggest faults lies in the soundtrack. Nothing hit as hard, and music was used much more sparingly. It was shocking that the biggest chase scene was nearly silent compared to what Fury Road did at every opportunity.
* **Babylon** - Incredibly up-and-down. It largely didn't click for me, especially the saccharine ending, except for every moment Brad Pitt was on screen: he was solid gold. And that speech by Jean Smart, too. I loved seeing her since Legion may well be my favourite TV show.
* **It Follows** - Turned out to be a massive disappointment, really. I think I was expecting a more methodical, robotic force that required clever rule use and the like, and while that's there to an extent to be sure, the continually revealed ability of the creature to think and react diminished things for me. It's less a force of nature, which makes it feel less scary somehow.
* **I'm Thinking Of Ending Things** - This was half-spoiled for me thanks to a video from Jacob Geller of all things, but I still thought it fantastic, possibly moreso because I knew the premise and went with it.
* **Can You Ever Forgive Me?** - All the Letterboxd reviews are right. Give them both Oscars. I am very much not a McCarthy fan, but that was an amazing movie. I really need to watch more with Richard E. Grant too, he's a delight.
* **The Double** - A wild movie, and forgive the pun, but I did a double-take when I saw the director was Richard Ayoade, never expected that. Intrigued the whole time, though I don't think Eisenberg can play a cool version of himself.
* **Phantom Thread** - Didn't think I'd care for a movie about a dressmaker, but it was Paul Thomas Anderson, who I had come to very much like this year, and Daniel Day-Lewis, so I had to try it. Absolutely did not expect the plot I got, or how much I liked it.
* **May December** - Most notable to me because I completely misjudged the premise since I had no knowledge going in. I assumed it was Natalie Portman & Julianne Moore who were in the age-gap romance. Fantastic film. Charles Melton sold it all sold well.
* **Bobby** - Watched this after JFK on a lark, seemed a sensible follow-up. I did not expect to care so much about everyone (well, not Slater's character...). The decaying materialistic relationship, the marriage to avoid Vietnam, the career devotee dealing with retirement. It also helped being Canadian and having little-to-no details on the collateral damage that occurred in that kitchen, and who survived. This one is definitely boosted by recency-bias, but I loved it.

*Lastly, some other random tidbits and musings.*

First, genres. I gave some more horror a chance, but I'm still not really into them. But I did discover as a result what is likely my favourite new genre of film, which are basically long-form Twilight Zone/Outer Limits episodes. That's how I'd describe Coherence and The Vast Of Night, and I would be immensely thankful for further recommendations of that ilk. My interest in movies about Hollywood is pretty 50/50: Mank & Trumbo were great, but Babylon mostly left me cold as noted above. The biggest surprise in this avenue, however, is that I don't like mob flicks. The Scorsese oeuvre did absolutely nothing for me this year (though I recall liking the Departed). Others like Donnie Brasco also didn't hit. Not a lot of comedies watched at all either, and that's probably not going to change. Dramas and thrillers are still where my heart lies.

Next, I got to go through a lot of works by specific directors and actors. Jeff Nichols was a lovely surprise, as noted. But Wes Anderson got the deepest dive from me, and turns out I love his style. Still more to see, too. Paul Thomas Anderson also got more viewings from me, and I'm very eager to see the rest of his work, can't imagine disliking any. I quite liked that Paul Schrader trilogy of sad men as well. Meanwhile, I have three notable mixed bags: Soderbergh, Ridley Scott, and the Coens. It's basically a 50/50, which I guess is expected as they both have large bodies of work, and jumping between genres. For actors, I remain unflinching that Jake Gyllenhaal is my favourite actor. Nightcrawler from years past cemented that for me, but I got to see a lot more of his work this year and not an iota of doubt creeped in. Rebecca Ferguson showed up numerous times, and I loved her on screen every time. She really caught me off-guard in Doctor Sleep, a movie I liked a lot more than I expected of such a sequel. The man himself aside, I have got to admit that Jared Leto can absolutely act: Requiem For A Dream, Dallas Buyers Club, Hell, he was giving his all in House Of Gucci even. Jesse Plemons was in so many movies I saw, sometimes in bit parts that just had me doing the Leo DiCaprio meme at the screen, but he's always a delight. ""How can that be profitable for Frito Lay?"" will be quoted back-and-forth between my wife and I for years. Finally, even though I've seen numerous movies with him in them in the past, I had no idea how prolific Jared Harris was. I genuinely, embarrassingly thought that Chernobyl was his first work. Feel free to laugh. 

The most important thing I learned of all though? All it takes to get me to watch a movie is the title. So many watched on the back of that alone, and not all them worth it:
**All The Old Knives, A Most Violent Year, The Devil All The Time, The Pale Blue Eye, A Cure For Wellness, The World To Come, Ain't Them Bodies Saints, Kill Your Darlings, Our Kind Of Traitor**, etc, etc.

So that's it. A year of movies completed, and I'm kind of proud of it. If there's any movies I've gone through that anyone wants to hear my thoughts on, by all means ask. Or any other questions or remarks. To cut off one: Will I do the same in 2025? God no! I do want to try and keep up on watching things a bit more than previous years, but I think I'll focus mostly on getting older films out of the way(I've only seen one Hitchcock film, for example), and rewatching stuff I've been meaning to for ages. Also probably Nosferatu. If I'm about to obsess on anything for the new year, it's looking like indie games are the culprit after everything I spent in the Steam sales...",27,34,1735747427.0,2025-01-01 16:03:47,False
dune2,dune sequel,1hqhgbd,I saw 71 movies in a theater this year. Here is my Personal Ranking List ,"Hello to those interested and about to read/skim this list and either comment on how good or bad it is. \[I wrote a ranking list last year of the 54 movies I saw in a theater. My New Year's Resolution was to see 55 movies in a theaters this year since I'm subscribed to A-List, and have 4 AMCs within 25 minutes of my house, and I surpassed the mark by 16 films this year with 71. Before you read the list/reviews, here are some quick notes:

\- 71-64: Pretty much the worst films I saw this year. These are films I would not recommend to anyone in the future, where I will mostly say negative things about the film (aka.... It Stinks!)

\- 63-56: are watchable films, with decent elements, but also aren't that good to me personally, and are possibly lacking in other areas. I would likely recommend the film to someone I know who would enjoy it, but also give a critique or two that I thought was missing

\- 55-27: Pretty much passable/watchable films that I at least thought were worth sitting through once, and could see myself sitting through again at some point in the future

\- 26-13: These are films I found pretty enjoyable from start to finish with very few issues that I could find in between. The higher these films are, the likelier it is that I would want to or be happy to watch these films again

\- 12-1: These are my personal best of the best from the year.

\- Some of these reviews are hyperlinked to my Instagram page. Feel free to give these a look, and follow if you would like

The List:

71.. Werewolves - Directed by Steven C. Miller: It REALLY Stinks

70.. The Book of Clarence - Directed by The Bullitts: I saw this as part of #AMCsScreenUnseen. And truth be told, it will be the last one. I am admittedly not much of a religious fanatic, so watching a film that bordered between”parody” and “epic” wasn’t a lot of fun for me or my fiancé. I did learn though why the Romans actually nailed Jesus’s hands and feet to the cross. So that was neat. It Stinks

69.. Borderlands - Directed by Eli Roth: Thanksgiving II can't come soon enough. It Stinks

68.. Night Swim - Directed by Bryce McGuire: Aka “We bought a pool”…. These are actual lines in the movie, and it’s what I always think of now when I’m reminded of this January filler. Mind you this is a quote from a supposedly famous baseball player that has millions, so how did he not purchase a place with a swimming pool before this….? It Stinks

67.. Argylle - Directed by Matthew Vaughn: I can only support you because of Kingsman for sooooo long before I have to say “enough”…. “Enough” with this Matt. We get it. Kingsman is cool, but this has been a wild fail of a universe for him to be building, and this latest installment in the “Kingsmen” universe is easily the worst and most forgettable one yet. It Stinks

66.. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire- Directed by Gil Kenan: I felt like you could tell how much Bill Murray was coerced into this movie because “$$$” talks. Just a painfully unfunny remake that included a subplot where Phoebe falls for a ghost, and tries to become one in order for her to receive her “7 minutes in heaven”, only to be double-crossed instead because it was all part of some elaborate plot to coerce her into doing all of this… if what I described sounds confusing, imagine what it felt like realizing this in the theater. It Stinks

65.. Kinds of Kindness - Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos: I saw “Poor Things” last year and had this rounding out my personal top 20. I also know that Yorgos makes polarizing films so this is in his wheelhouse. It’s three short films with one side character that interweaves them all together. For some, especially those that enjoy all of Yorgo’s work, this is another good installment. For me? Kinds of Kindness was just kind of “meh”.

64.. Here - Directed by Robert Zemeckis: Truth be told. This movie would’ve been further down the list if it wasn’t for the fact that this was part of a Double Feature that my fiancé and I did instead of watching the election results, and I will take this film 10 times out of 10 over watching that political theatre. Robert’s love for technology really seems to hurt the story in this one, along with the fact that a place’s “history” doesn’t actually feel historical when you watch it happen on screen.

63.. Joker: Folie a Deux - Directed by Todd Phillips: When the movie first ended I honestly have to admit I enjoyed it… but then I realized later that a big part of it was because my audience was SO upset by the final 10 minutes of the movie. Part satire, drama, and more “karaoke” than musical, it felt more like a parody of a musical than an actual one with Gaga barely being in this movie for the amount of marketing for this. You’re definitely not gonna be talking about this one the same way like the first movie.

62.. The Beekeeper - Directed by David Ayer: It’s a Jason Statham film. If you even like his movies, then park your butt on the couch and come watch another fun and mindless roller coaster where Claire Huxtable’s money is stolen, and it is up to Jason Stratham to save the day! (This is the actual plot of this movie)

61.. ISS - Directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite: The first 2/3rds of this movie are actually very well done, but it falls apart rapidly by the 1/3rd act where you then start pointing out some plotting issues. It’s a decent time if you can forget how it ends.

60.. Drive-Away Dolls - Directed by Ethan Coen: The Coen Bros. will always have my support for The Big Lebowski, so I was not going to miss this “low-stakes but fun” coming-of-age film where two women get caught in the middle of a heist involving the dumbest criminals I’ve watched on film this year. For those that are saying “I’m looking for something different with films I’m seeing these days”, there’s not many that are as out there with their plot than this one.

59.. I Saw the TV Glow - Directed by Jane Schoenbrun: If you find yourself going to the movies as often as I do, you will eventually stumble upon what I call your personal “Beau is Afraid” film. The “Beau is Afraid” film I basically term as a film that is well-directed, and even makes compels you all the way until the end… and then once it ends, you wonder “what the fuck just happened?”, and this is my “Beau is Afraid” film for this year. It is a well directed and acted film about two people growing up in the 90s, and then becoming older before even knowing it. It is very anxiety inducing, and will end with you feeling pretty uneasy

58.. IF - Directed by John Krasinski: This is a kid’s film that is truly for kids, while also tying in an adult stake of a father going through “surgery” (although it’s not specified what that surgery even is?). There are some nice moments, notably when Bea is creating the imaginary world around her, but it’s likely something your kid will play on repeat far more than you will. If you’re a parent, get headphones

57.. The Fall Guy - Directed by David Leitch: An ode to stuntmen, that certainly had great action scenes. However, I personally thought that it was too far between a slowly drawn out plot. Come for the action, make dinner for the dialogue.

56.. Babygirl - Directed by Halina Reijn: I was a big fan of “Bodies, Bodies, Bodies”, and this is a decent follow up from the director regarding the cinematography. An incredibly well shot film. However, I still question how Romy did all of these objectively fireable/“voted off the board” offenses, and the biggest penalty is that she takes on a more BTS role as the CEO while those “protecting/blackmailing” her are given higher positions. Not to mention that the final sequence in the film heavily implied to me that she found her “sexual awakening” and repaired her marriage through this love affair, and should have possibly done it sooner. So it kind of felt like a 2 hour dissertation to have an affair, when 99% of the time when practiced, you are justifiably scrutinized hard for it, while also ruining lives, including your own, in its wake. And it’s barely touched in this movie. Until promiscuity becomes a true norm, I don’t see what was depicted in the film actually going over the way it did in Babygirl.

55.. Kung Fu Panda 4 - Directed by Mike Mitchell: It’s another film that pretty much pales in comparison to the original, but it’s still passable in every way as well offering more of what we’ve all come to love from Poe. My favorite part though had to be the ending credits where Tenacious D did their cover of “Hit Me Baby One More Time”.

54.. The Garfield Movie - Directed by Mark Dindal: I won’t deny that this film is very low on my list, but I will say that for a film no one was really clamoring for, I enjoyed this a lot. At least a lot more than the live-action ones that came out in 2004 when I was a kid. It’s more of the same from the feline companion, but the animation looks good, and it treats the source material fairly well with who Garfield really is… a lazy and food loving cat who begrudgingly loves the people in his life.

53.. Moana 2 - Directed by David Ledoux Miller, Jason Hand, and David Derrick Jr.: This is an interesting film because it was initially not intended to be one. The animated mini-series wound up blossoming into a pretty worthy sequel that does well to build on Moana’s universe, while also giving us the fun we’ve come to expect from Maui. I should note though that it does not hit the emotional highs as the first, so hopefully the third film will go back to its own “roots” and rehire LMM to create some more classics.

52.. Trap - Directed by M. Night Shyamalan: The film is not too memorable, and admittedly can be considered a “front” for M. Night’s daughter to help her own career (she’s one of the leads in this movie), but gosh is Josh Hartnett compelling on screen. He pretty much carries this film to a passable status because of how good of an actor he is. Shoutout for Cudi as well in his brief cameo. If you can put Cudi in anything, it definitely makes it at least a few points better for me.

51.. Nosferatu - Directed by Robert Eggers: After 102 years, Nosferatu was finally resurrected and given an update. And it is certainly every bit as gothic and horrifying as its original… but also I wasn’t a huge fan of the pacing. It took a while for the dread to settle in for me. However, I am happy that this was given a chance by Eggers to even be made.

50.. Mean Girls - Directed by Samantha Jane, Arturo Perez Jr.: While I don’t really peg it as the true classic that defined the mid-late 2000s, I personally enjoyed this musical follow-up.

49.. Wonka - Directed by Paul King: My 1st film of 2024. When this was first announced, I do recall a collective “why”, but the truth is that this was a nice film that gives some fun backstory to Willy Wonka and how he built his factory. Also helped reveal Timothee’s range and expand into family films

48.. Twisters - Directed by Lee Isaac Chung: It was fun watching the pre-interview screening and hearing how the cast was on location for this film, and truth be told, it’s not a bad sequel from a film released 28 years earlier. In fact, the technology today helps enhance it for a screen that was worthy for IMAX/Dolby. There’s not much plot, and the climax borders on “suspension”, but it’s still a thrilling ride. If you FEEL it! CHASE it!

47.. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire - Directed by Adam Wingard: Living in the “Godzillasance” is one of the things keeping me hyped in life currently. If you would’ve told me this as a kid? Even then I would not believe you and discuss how “Zilla” ruined the franchise. So I will pretty much watch all films until the wheels fall off. I mention this because this is not necessarily the best “Godzilla” film. Truth be told, it’s about 75% Kong, and 25% Godzilla. But those few scenes that Godzilla is in are still awesome. That fight between Kong and Godzilla in Egypt was bonkers.

46.. Abigail - Directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett: This film reminded me a lot of “Renfield”, which was a favorite of mine last year. However, I felt it took itself a bit too seriously compared to other campy vampire films like “Renfeld” and the classic “From Dusk Till Dawn”

45.. Boy Kills World - Directed by Moritz Mohr: It’s nice to see Bill Skarsgard without a ton of makeup on. Not to mention he gets to be a cool badass in this movie that involves H Jon Benjamin doing narration cause he’s a mute. Thie lack of “Bob Belcher” in the 2nd half lost it a bit for me.

44.. Lisa Frankenstein - Directed by Zelda Williams: Robin Williams’s daughter’s directorial debut, and it was a fun and campy time where the stakes were very low, and everyone involved seems to be enjoying themselves. It’s worth it just to watch everyone have a fun time with this movie.

43.. Cuckoo - Directed by Tilman Singer: This film was a pretty supervise trip. I won’t forget when the girl starts hallucinating in the car and I was wondering at first if the film was breaking, and then realizing that she’s losing control. As someone who’s dabbled with hallucinogenics, that is a real feeling that happens. This ties into this weird undercurrent that stays with this film compared to the others on this list.

42.. Love Lies Bleeding - Directed by Rose Glass: This movie was sexy and violent, and also comes with an ending twist that I’ve only come to expect A24 to deliver on. If it was any other studio, I would’ve likely hated the ending, but it’s A24, and they’ve built up so much goodwill that I can respect the originality on it.

41.. In A Violent Nature - Directed by Chris Nash: The ending is divisive, but I personally loved the whole idea that we’re watching the movie through the killer’s perspective. The dread of seeing how he was about to murder the people was a new feeling for me with horror. The ending is ambiguous enough for a possible sequel, and I hope that happens.

40.. Tuesday - Directed by Diana O. Pusic: A medium on death through the perspective of a parrot doesn’t sound like a usual concept for a film, but Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Lola Petticrew make this a nice emotional study of a mom coming to terms with her daughter’s terminal diagnosis. For myself, I was fortunate to be part of a Q&A with the director and actors after which enhanced the experience.

39.. Thelma - Directed by Josh Margolin: Another nice little medium on aging that was based on a personal experience by the director when his own grandmother was almost scammed out of money. The piece is very personal as evidenced by the fact that he not only directed the film, but wrote and edited it as well. And what results is a low-stakes, but relatable piece about our loved ones and how we accept our age.

38.. The Bikeriders  - Directed by Jeff Nichols: A nice film that, much like the people the actors are portraying, seems to coast by until the film reaches its conclusion. It’s very well acted, and if you’re curious about a part of America that you might know about, this can educate you a bit on it, but there are elements missing that make this a a classic like “Easy Rider”

37.. Blitz - Directed by Steve McQueen: The WWII historian in me is a sucker for a film that actually covers the Blitz. And when the action is really happening, it does VERY well where I can’t help but respect it. However, there are continuity issues I spotted during the film which left me confused once it concluded.

36.. \[Red One\](https://www.instagram.com/p/DCR1FKhP5EV/?igsh=MXVnaTdtaHJ5ZXlr) - Directed by Jake Kasdan: Maybe it’s my admitted love for The Final Boss since I am a big pro-wrestling stan, but I really didn’t find this to be nearly as bad as I thought it was. It was pretty much a Marvel film, but stripped of the IP and framing it around Santa. Not the best film, but not the worst. Can certainly see kids gravitating and watching it again just to reenact scenes that happened.

35.. Bad Boys: Ride or Die - Directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah: You would’ve though that they’d flip “Ride or Die” and “4 Life” since it makes more sense, but I digress. This is a fun time with Martin Lawrence pretty much stealing the show with every scene he was in. I was cackling through half of his lines. Also, love how they gave Marcus the ultimate redemption arc.\\

34.. Monkey Man - Directed by Dev Patel: What happens when you take an orphan who is angry with the world and throw him into the caste system? Monkey man. A strong directorial from director/star Dev Patel, who takes his revenge out unmercifully on his way to the top.

33.. The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare - Directed by Guy Ritchie: It’s a slick take on an unknown WWII story by Guy Ritchie. IF you like his films like I do, you will have a good time with this since it’s basically Henry Cavill and Alan Ritchson + others killing Nazis.

32.. Piece by Piece - Directed by Morgan Neville: There’s a possibility that this was solely done through “LEGOs” because Universal wanted ot retain the rights. There’s likely truth to it, but I also would not be surprised if one of the most influential music producers of the 21st century wanted to make this doc “feel” different than others. And the truth is that it’s a great and innovative time. You kind of get to peak inside his mind a bit thanks to the animation as opposed to if this was live-action. The great music he produced is also littered throughout so this can be a good time to bond with your kid about great music that was collaborated on by a great producer.

31.. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes - Directed by Wes Ball: Prior to Kingdom, Wes’s only directing credit was for The Maze Runner, which I admittedly don’t have a huge desire to see currently. So when I heard he was announced as the director for this movie I was admittedly hesitant…  After? I hope he’s given the keys to build the universe. Very fine follow up that inches us that much closer to the eventual remake of “PotA”

30.. Gladiator II - Directed by Ridley Scott: The movie’s scale and scope are pretty epic this time around compared to the first, and Denzel just owns this movie the moment he steps on screen. He’s the man. If he was not in this movie, it would be a lot further down my list.

29.. Transformers: One- Directed by Josh Cooley: It’s unfortunate that this film was DOA, because it’s easily the best Transformers film I watched, and this is from someone who is more of a passive fan. The origin stories of Optimus and Megatron felt genuine, and Chris gave a great VO performance. I felt by the end that he was the Optimus Prime of my childhood.

28.. Sonic the Hedgehog 3 - It's rare when the 3rd part winds up being the best, but this is exactly what Sonic the Hedgehog 3 was. It was probably the closest adaptation that I've seen of the original games, and Jim Carrey just seemed to be enjoying playing as Dr. Eggman again. The laser dance sequence was also my personal favorite dance scene of the year.

27.. Heretic - Directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods: There is apparently a lot of personal experience put into this movie, with comments that I read speaking about how this movie did a pretty good job portraying the “missionary” experience of mormonism. And while I can’t admittedly say the finish was my taste, it was the very compellingly disturbing performance from ""rom-com"" legend Hugh Grant.

26.. Y2K - Directed by Kyle Mooney: It’s been a long time since I’ve cackled in a theater for a b-level comedy, and this was just the perfect blend of a nostalgia and cringe to remind me of a time before iPhones, where Fred Durst and “The Thong Song” was on everyone’s mixtape

25.. Deadpool & Wolverine - Directed by Shawn Levy: This will hopefully be the shot of adrenaline that Marvel needs to course correct while they’ve got the chance. For the first R-rated MCU film, it was a very fun time, and had me straight up geeking out during the bus sequence when Wolverine put on the mask.

24.. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice - Directed by Tim Burton: I’ve got love for the Juice. And watching the town of Winter River come back to life was a joy to see, along with how much fun Michael Keaton seemed to be having paying Beetlejuice again. He’s infectious in the role, and while it admittedly falls short of the first film, there’s room for one more possible movie to help really stick this landing.

23.. Longlegs - Directed by Oz Perkins: What a thriller this was. I was surprised at just how off-putting Nicholas Cage actually as in this role. It might be one of my favorites simply for that fact because I was creeped out by him for most of this film. The twist was also fun for myself, especially since the ending was pretty bleak

22.. Speak No Evil - Directed by Christian Dafdrup: This film is pretty much the inverse of Longlegs where you can probably spot the twist coming, but it does not take away from the thrill of the journey to get there. James McAvoy is at his creepy best, and it is disturbing to watch how twisted he becomes as the film continues.

21.. The Wild Robot - Directed by Chris Sanders: The only thing I could think of once this concluded? “Wow. What a delightful movie”. Age won’t matter in this heartfelt film about finding your way, being accepted, and surviving, even if the road is treacherous. Equal parts funny and touching, it can either be a great family film, or a great medium on what it means to be a parent.

20.. Inside Out 2 - Directed by Kelsey Mann: I’m a clinical therapist by trade. So I have an incredibly soft spot for Inside Out and how it teaches us about who we are and the emotions that make us up. So of course I have been using this sequel as a resource since it honestly does an even better job explaining the emotions we have now, compared to the first. Life becomes more complex and socially complicated the older we get. Little things we say or do can have big ramifications that we can ruminate over like an endless replay. And Inside Out 2 did a great job explaining some of these new emotions, with anxiety leading the pack. If you have not seen it yet, I highly recommend giving it a watch to at least understand our emotions a bit better.

19.. One Life - Directed by James Hawes: Not many know the heroic tale of Nichols Winston and his courage to have 669 Jewish children adopted before WWII began. And this film does a fine job discussing the stakes, the drama, and the courage that Nicholas and his peers had to help these kids find safety before it was too late. It is a difficult film to watch, but also necessary to show the humanity that is still there in others.

18.. The Apprentice - Directed by Ali Abbasi: There are a lot that have had enough of this person, and are dreading what is to come. So it is appropriate to say “why the fuck do we need more media covering him?” Well the truth is that regardless of your opinion, the incoming president is going to be looked at as a very historical figure in human history, and it’s films like The Apprentice that will hopefully teach a future generation about how we got here, and why it was awful to let it happen. I wish luck to the future impersonators of the former tv host, because Sebastian Stan gives a haunting performance that sets the bar incredibly high for future impersonations. By the end of this movie, I thought he had actually become him. And this doesn’t get into my thoughts on Jeremy Strong as Roy Cohn. Legitimately jaw-dropping performance by him. Due to the risks involved that both of these men have taken, I do hope that it pays off in some Oscar nominations, because they do deserve it.

17.. Didi - Directed by Sean Wang: Avery intimate film about an “American experience” through the life of a Korean teenager learning to find his own place in the world. He’s got a mom who cares for him, but is also hoping for him to be more structured, and a grandma who the main character can’t help but care for, along with an annoying sister who he begrudgingly loves. It’s a very human film that touches on a lot of beats that make this a great film worth seeing.

16.. My Old Ass - Directed by Megan Park: Part “Arrival”, and part “About Time”, this film is a lovely and poignant piece about love, loss, and what this person would do if they knew about the inevitable. It is a very touching movie about what our heart wants.

15.. Late Night with the Devil - Directed by Cameron & Colin Cairnes: Led by famous character actor David Dastmalchian, this is the first movie I found since “Nightcrawler” to flip the lens on the media itself, and what exactly “drives” our interest. It is done as a “found” documentary film, which helps add to the uneasiness as the film continues. David does a genuinely good job carrying the lead which hopefully leads to more opportunities in the future, and while the final act is divisive, it is still an interesting take on the media, and how far one is willing to go to grab a rating.

14.. A Quiet Place: Day One - Directed by Michael Sarnoski: Some will say it didn’t show enough destruction of NYC, but this to me was just like Cloverfield where you feel more of the peril of the characters who are stuck in the city with no idea on what exactly is going on. Given the budget was also only $67 million, it is impressive what little destruction scenes Michael was able to capture on film, and tied it into a human story of a person enjoying one last slice of pizza at the end of the world.

13.. Smile 2 - Directed by Parker Finn: Because of I use film as a self-care activity, my fiancé has come along with me to enjoy pretty much every film that is out in theaters. She has also watched other movies to catch her up on sequels. And this was very important because she whispered to me at the beginning of Smile 2 that what was happening was canonically 6 days after the person saw the main character kill herself in the first movie. This was important to me because this film is not going to hold your hand. It’s going to mess with you from the start, making you second guess everything that you’re watching as the host latches itself onto a popstar, and is prepared to start a mass casualty event once it's done with her.

12.. Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga - Directed by George Miller: It’s a damn shame this movie didn’t take off. Like, I know it wasn’t something we were asking for. But my god, I am SO happy that I went to watch this. The gates of Valhalla are still just as shiny and chrome as ever in this prequel, where we learn more of the lore that led to the insane action film of 2015. And there is one particular sequence called the “Stairway to Nowhere” that is probably one of the most well shot sequences to be released this year. In addition, Chris Hemsworth gives his best performance to date play the diabolical Dementus, who pretty much is the inverse of Thor. He’s dirty, ugly, a menace, and does not care about anyone. That is, except for “Littal D”. If you are a fan of the Mad Max saga, then it is more than worth traveling back to the wasteland for this.

11.. Anora - Directed by Sean Baker: Earlier I mentioned how I watched “Here” to distract me from this year’s general election, I watched another as well, and I could not be happier that it was this. What an amazingly well-crafted film. It’s a dirty and real take on what we are hoping for with our “American Dream”, and Mikey absolutely SHINES in this role that was legitimately made for her. She is “Anora”, and I don’t think any actress could really pull off the role as well as she did. There is lots of word swirling that this is going to be an “Oscar” darling, and I do hope that it is because it is equal parts sexy, hilarious, and tragic.

10.. Saturday Night - Directed by Jason Reitman: Being up front, I am a huge SNL stan, and will always admire those that have made it onto the show. What not many know about though is just how much of a “maverick” this show and Lorne were. The executives did not give this show much of a chance, along with some of Lorne’s actors going AWOL hours before the show was supposed to air, and a set that literally ignited hours before the first show. How Lorne actually got this program off the ground is just as amazing as it is for him to keep it running for 50 years, and this film does an admirable job showing the chaos and love that is behind this cultural staple in TV history.

9.. Memoir of a Snail - Directed by Adam Elliot: My favorite animated film this year. Adam directed another film a while back called “Max & Mary” that was also very well done. “Memoir of a Snail” pretty much adds elements that were lacking in the previous film, and enhances it to help become an even more personal experience about a melancholic woman who hoards snails to as a way to shelter herself from all of the stressors that have occurred in her life. It’s tragic, and hopeful, and makes you hope for more adult animated films.

8.. Civil War - Directed by Alex Garland: The title speaks for itself, doesn’t it? It is a film taking place through the lens of war photographers. These people help push Alex’s bigger story about what it might look like if it all goes to hell in this country, and he doesn’t make it easy. This movie reminded me a lot of Contagion in how it tried to ground itself to make it feel like “this CAN happen”. The only difference between Contagion and Civil War is that this film actually moved me where I felt shocked and depressed after. It is a very bleak outlook on our future, but one that I can’t help but respect just for even attempting to make an uncomfortable movie like Civil War.

7.. A Real Pain - Directed by Jesse Eisenberg: Another “lived experience” film that hits deeply to me due to my own cultural roots. As a Jewish person, I question my existence constantly, and this film pretty much encapsulates that experience for me as a millennial who has a direct lineage to family members who passed away our survived from the Holocaust. The love we have for others run deep, and it can be exhausting… but we still love them despite what they do, and it’s what I love and appreciate about this film the most

6.. Alien: Romulus - Directed by Fede Alvarez: I’ve waited too long to finally watch a proper Alien movie on a movie screen, and I finally got it with this addition by Fede. This film pretty much takes the genre back to its roots about just why this franchise is so terrifying to begin with. The movie intentionally moves at a slow pace at first, but once the characters go inside that incubator chamber… 0-1000 in an instant, and it doesn’t let up until it ends. This is exactly what fans of the Alien franchise had been hoping for, and I’m glad I can finally say I saw a legitimately terrifying Alien movie on the big screen in my life.

5.. DUNE: Part II- Directed by Denis Villeneuve: If you thought Part I of this epic saga on Arrakis was wild, the 2nd Part pretty much adds onto everything, with strong performances by all who were involved, but especially Javier Bardem, who channels his inner “Monty Python” to deliver a hilarious, but also very realistic take on a devout follower who believes that Timothee is the Mahdi. And the truth is, by the end of this movie I was ready to crown him the Mahdi myself. This was an epic continuation of a saga that has one more battle to be prepared for.

4.. Wicked: Part I - Directed by Jon Chu: I love broadway. I find it a fantastic medium where craft, music, acting, and dancing come to life all in an instant. Translating a broadway show to become a movie is not easy, but Jon and his crew knocked it out of the part with the first rendition of Wicked. I found myself loving a lot of parts to this movie. From the singing, to the feeling of being transported back into Oz for the first time since watching the original, to Ariana’s rendition of Popular, to “Defying Gravity”, to the fact that 2 hours and 40 minutes did not feel that long, to the fact that the movie ended like it was the “intermission”, and not the true end to the film. Jon and his team seemed to spare no expense when it came to making this musical feel like we’re watching the broadway play at a massive discount. And I appreciate them for that because broadway plays are expensive. They all delivered a stunning film that feels every bit as magical as the first time we all stepped into Oz. What is great for them now is they can ride the momentum of the first film into Part II next year without doing anything because they already finished the shoot. Can’t deny it is a brilliant marketing strategy that will probably make massive money in the long run. I know I’m going to be there opening night to see the finale.

3.. Kill - Directed by Nikhil Nagesh Bhat: As much as I love musicals… I love one man army’s even more. And this genuinely could be the scariest one man army I have ever come across. I first learned about this film from one of those trailers that are packed with reviews that say “you have to see this movie.” Since I had nothing better to do on July 4th I figured, why not? And I’m very glad I did that because Amrit Rathod is the scariest dude walking the planet. I am fully convinced he can take on Jason Bourne and John Wick and come out on top after watching this insanity. Make no mistake, Amrit is a different animal compared to the others. He lives by a code, and once it’s broken, you better start preparing your last rites, cause he will break you down until you’re absolutely nothing... And THEN he will kill you. I honestly think this movie could’ve possibly pushed the genre even further because of some of the there are simply kills that I have not seen before on the big screen, and this movie was not shy at all in delivering them.

2.. The Zone of Interest - Directed by Jonathan Glazer: Probably the most educational film about The Holocaust that has ever been made, or aside from since Schindler’s List. What I love about this movie is that unlike Schindler, there is nothing good about this film. It is awful. And you come to realize just how “banal” we truly are as a species once it’s done. I found myself growing more detested as the film continued. And that is its point. At one time this was not a movie. This was a real, world-changing event that occurred where people were sent to concentration camps to suffer and die, and all of us as a species grew desensitized to the point that we did not feel any remorse for these “fellow” humans (and truth be told, I still don’t)… all the while the scum were standing less than 20 feet away pretending that they were not committing the atrocities that they were. This is the inverse of “One Life” where instead of educating us on the good that humans are capable of, it shows us just how evil we really are, and that is admittedly a much bigger reality than the miracles and good people that DO occur during these awful times. In order to possibly prevent it in the future, we need to still educate today. And this film is as educational as it gets.

1.. American Fiction - Directed by Cord Jefferson: It’s unfortunate this movie came out in the completely packed year that was 2023, because this is easily one of my favorite “American experience” movies I remember, and I think it’s because of how mundane it is that I love it so much. The characters are going through their own sets of trauma that would be very similar to ours, and also have a dynamic that feels very natural to the relationships we have with our loved ones. Jeffery Wright and Sterling K. Brown also give fantastic performances that are equally hilarious, endearing, and thought-provoking as well. What is so fantastic too is how much they make the dialogue feel natural. It really feels like you’re living the life with this writer as he uncovers the hypocrisy and racial dynamics in an incredibly niche aspect of society. The way Jefferson makes it all thread perfectly was so much fun. My favorite part though that cements this as my favorite has to be the ending. It’s kind of abrupt, but also in this very well done way that reminds us that just like the main characters in this movie, life will continue onwards, and it’s what we do with it that is really going to matter the most.

Re-releases I watched:

\- In addition to the 71 films I watched, I also saw two re-releases, Coraline and Interstellar to total out to 73 movies I went to see.

Conclusion:

I saw a lot more films than I did last year, which is great because it (hopefully) shows to me that the industry itself is at least churning out regular features again. If you would've told me this back in 2020, there's no way I'd believe you. While the recovery isn't there yet, and there are genuine critiques on a lack of originality, it's nice to know how strong this year was when it comes to regular releases. So with that, I hope you enjoyed reading the list as much as I did watching, ranking, reflecting, and reviewing on the year that was 2024 in movies. Would like to know your thoughts on the list and your personal favorites as well. To 2025, the year of our remake, and Superman.",7,36,1735660309.0,2024-12-31 15:51:49,False
dune2,dune sequel,1hmtvhj,my top 10 favorite movies of 2024,"before we begin, i must emphasize that this list is 100% my own opinion and should not be taken as fact. my tastes will inevitably be different from other people. also, just because a movie isn't on this list doesn't mean i didn't like it. that's certainly a possibility but not a certainty. without further ado, let's begin.

10: didi

remember mid 90s? that comedy drama from 2018 that jonah hill directed that told the story of a child growing up in the 90s? well, didi is basically mid 90s if it was set in the late 2000s. and while it's not as good as booksmart, it's still a highly entertaining movie. for starters, this movie is fucking hilarious. most of the humor comes from the extremely witty dialogue courtesy of the script written by sean wang, who has a masterful understanding of dialogue. the film also has some solid performances with the leading performance by izzac wang being one of my favorite movie performances of the year. the film also has quite a bit of heart as well and perfectly captures that nostalgic feeling of being a child on the cusp of growing up. my only real problem with the movie is that it does meander quite a bit. but other then that, didi is a highly entertaining movie and one of the finest of the year.

9: love lies bleeding

February saw the releases of two thrillers about lesbians, drive away dolls and love lies bleeding. and of the two, love lies bleeding was easily the best one. set in 1989, love lies bleeding tells the story of a female gym manager falling in love with a female bodybuilder. if you think this is just going to be a typical lesbian romance movie, think again because this movie also has crime families and murder. and throughout the whole thing, i was in that weird position of wanting to get to the next scene to figure out where the story would go but also not wanting the movie to end. this movie is extremely suspenseful to the point where it honestly feels like a brian de palma movie. all of the characters are fully fleshed out with distinct personalities that makes it easy to either love them or love to hate them. kristen stewart and katy o brien do amazing jobs as the two female leads. but the show stealer to me is ed harris, who gives a performance that can only be described as unsettling. i also seriously need to give props to the cinematography by ben fordesman which both perfectly captures the mood of the film and also just looks really pretty. overall, love lies bleeding is sure to go down as one of the best thrillers of the 2020s, a title that it very much deserves.

8: in a violent nature

slasher movies are nothing new. as a matter of fact, in a violent nature is pretty much the typical slasher movie. however, there is a new twist to it. it's a slasher movie from the perspective of the killer. now if that isn't a head turning premise, i don't know what is. and beyond it's clever and unique premise, in a violent nature still manages to be a really solid movie. for starters, this movie is extremely pretty to look at. this movie makes excellent usage of natural lighting and natural beauty, thus making the violence that occurs stand out even more. as i previously mentioned, the movie takes place almost exclusively from the perspective of the main killer, who isn't so much a character as he is a force of nature. johnny is basically jason voorhees except with slightly more layers. he wants his locket back and he doesn't care who he has to kill in order to get it back. he's utterly terrifying but, at the same time, you can't help but feel sympathy for him. my only real problem with the movie is the long stretches of very little happening. there are several scenes depicting johnny just walking through the forest. while it's not too huge of a problem since we get to see more of the beautiful cinematography(seriously, i cannot stress enough how pretty this movie is), these scenes add very little aside from showing us how johnny got from point A to point B. other then that, in a violent nature is a very compelling watch that is sure to please both fans of slasher movies and fans of slow burn horror.

7: kingdom of the planet of the apes

when this movie was announced, i was quite skeptical since i thought that the planet of the apes reboot trilogy ended perfectly with the death of ceaser. however, while it wasn't quite as good as those movies or the 1968 original, kingdom of the planet of the apes is still a really solid movie. taking place 300 years after the death of ceaser, kingdom of the planet of the apes focuses on noa, the son of a tribe elder who's village is attacked, his father is killed, and the surviving members of his tribe are kidnapped. noa must go on a grand quest to save them, running into an orangutan priest and a human with a secret. i must say that this is easily the prettiest film in the planet of the apes series. pretty much every shot in this movie is awe inspiring to look at. and not just the CGI shots but the shots to utilize actual locations as well. speaking of CGI, the CGI is just as good as it was in the reboot trilogy. noa is also a really compelling protagonist who goes on a journey of self discovery. my only real complaints about the movie is that the villain is a bit weak, william H macy's character didn't serve much of a point beyond having a recognizable face, and noa looked at bit too similar to ceaser. otherwise, the day that you see this movie, you will stand up and proclaim ""WHAT A WONDERFUL DAY""!

6: nosferatu

when it was announced that robert eggers, one of the best directors currently working, was going to be remaking F W murnau's horror classic nosferatu, many people were very excited. and everyone who watched the teaser in june only had their excitement justified. and then, the movie actually came out and...wow! just...wow! i do not exaggerate when i say, and i'm saying this as someone who's seen longlegs, nosferatu is the best horror movie of 2024 and possibly in the top 5 of the best horror movies of the decade. the film's greatest strength is it's atmosphere. this movie perfectly captures the atmosphere of the murnau original while also offering a new experience. the cinematography is absolutely stunning and it might be egger's second best looking movie behind the lighthouse. the performances are really good espeically bill skarsgaard, lily rose depp, and willem dafoe. is it egger's best movie? hell no. the lighthouse is egger's best movie and that's how it will probably always be. nevertheless, eggers is continuing to demostrate why he is one of the great masters of horror of the 21st century and, with films like nosferatu, it's clear that he will only continue to improve as his career goes on.

5: deadpool and wolverine

saying that 2023 was a rough year for the MCU would be like saying that the titanic has some water damage. with the exceptions of guardians of the galaxy vol 3, loki season 2, and what if season 2, pretty much every MCU project that year bombed. and that's not even getting into the behind the scenes drama including but not limited to numerous projects getting delayed and jonathan major's conviction that led to him getting the boot. thankfully, 2024 seemed to be a return to form for the MCU. unlike previous years where we got at least three MCU movies, in 2024 we only got one. but holy shit! what a movie it was! this is one of the most entertaining movies of the year. like, i knew that the movie was gonna be a lot of fun going in but i could never have anticipated it being this much of a blast. deadpool and wolverine have such great chemistry as enemies turned friends and ryan reynolds and hugh jackman continue to show that they were born to play their respective roles. the film has lots of hilarious comedy to the point where i would probably consider it to be the funniest movie of the year. the film also has some really good action scenes, especially the opening fight scene which might feature the best usage of an NSYNC song in any movie. cassandra nova, despite her limited screentime, is a really good villain and is pretty much everything fans could hope for from the premise ""what if charles xavier was evil"". and then, there's the fan service. over the past couple of years, it has become common for movies based on IPs to pander to the fanbase quite a bit. deadpool and wolverine does this but in a good way. the film features the returns of actors who have not played their respective roles in years and they are just as great as they previously were. above all else, this movie is a love letter and farewell to the marvel franchises that existed before the MCU. with the MCU buying the rights to franchises that were previously out of their grasp, this movie gives the previous incarnations of these characters one final hoorah. and it is immensely satisfying. plus, the end credits feature clips and behind the scenes footage from these incarnations of the characters and it all ends with one final look at the 20th century fox logo. funny, action packed, and heartwarming, deadpool and wolverine is a crowd pleaser that helped the MCU get back on track.

4: the wild robot

dreamworks can be a bit of a mixed bag. when dreamworks is good, it's great. but when it's bad, it's horrible. one minute, they're making movies such as the prince of egypt, the first two shrek movies, spirit stallion of the cimarron, puss in boots the last wish, kung fu panda, and other solid movies. and the next, they're making crap like shrek the third, shark tale, the boss baby, and ruby gillman teenage kraken. however, i had heard some good early buzz about their latest outing, the wild robot. i even heard some people saying that it could contend for best picture. well, i saw the movie and, while i don't think it's best picture material, i'd be lying if i said that it was a bad movie. because it's not and, in fact, it might be in my top 10 favorite dreamworks movies. but even if it doesn't have that title, it's still the best animated movie of the year. while i am getting a little bit sick of all animated movies nowadays being CGI, the visuals in this movie are awe inspiring. the animation is absolutely breathtaking. the film also has great voice acting from it's all star cast. this is lupita nyongo's first animated movie and she absolutely knocked it out of the park. the film also has one of the best scores of any movie this year. i sincerely hope that kirk bowers gets a nomination for his score for this movie. also, this is a film that truly gets that film is a VISUAL medium. the film makes excellent usage of visual storytelling with several long stretches of no dialogue. the film also has a great message about found family and being more then your instincts. i do have a few problems with the movie though. while it does tackle them with new angles and the quality of the movie more then makes up for it, this is the same robot learning to love and disabled child overcoming disabilities plotline that we've seen several times before. also, the film's attempts at humor are kinda hit or miss. for every joke that works, there's one that doesn't. but hey, at least there aren't any shoehorned in pop culture references. aside from those problems, the wild robot is my favorite animated movie of the whole year. while inside out 2 seems to be the favorite for best animated feature this year, i think that the wild robot is also a worthy contender for the award as well. i'd even go so far as to say that it should also recieve a best picture nomination.

3: monkey man

when the trailer for monkey man came out, i didn't really know what to make of it. it looked very surreal and a bit off the wall. i was kind of interested by the fact that it was being written and directed by dev patel in his directorial debut. well, i decided to go see it and i was utterly blown away by how good it was. if i hadn't been told that it was made by a first time director, i would have thought that it was made by an experienced filmmaker. this movie has some of the best action i've seen on the big screen in quite some time. the true standout for me was the climatic dining room scene which kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. the acting is pretty good for the most part with the best performance coming from ashwini kalsekar as queenie. make no mistake though, the action and technical are the star of this movie. the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and, if it wasn't for the number 1 entre on the list, it would easily be the prettiest movie of the year. my only real problem with the movie is that it's a pretty cliche story. however, i am firmly of the opinion that it's better to be derivative and good then original and bad. and monkey man is most certainly good.

2: kalki 2898 AD

now, i'm going to tell you the plot for kalki 2898 AD and i need you to understand that i am not making a word of this up. in the far off future, an immortal emperor tries to make a serum that will make him all powerful and he does this by killing the unborn babies of mothers who can carry a baby to term. one of these women is said to have god growing in her womb and must escape capture with the help of another immortal person who is prophesized to save the unborn god. sounds pretty crazy right? but there is more reason to watch kalki 2898 AD then just it's crazy premise since this movie is absolutely amazing. the action is great, the music is amazing, the cinematography is gorgeous, the humor is actually funny and doesn't conflict with the tone, the characters are all interesting, and the movie is actually quite original. kalki 2898 AD is a movie that clearly wears it's influences on it's sleeve but in a good way. it takes ideas from other works and works them into something completely new. imagine my excitement when i found out that this movie was the first installment in a cinematic universe. while cinematic universes are a pretty overdone concept in a post MCU world, any excuse to get more of this is a good one. if the sequel is getting released next year, then that is my most anticipated movie of next year. that having been said, there are some pretty significant flaws with this movie. for starters, there are WWAAYY too many characters. most of them are interesting and well acted but there really doesn't need to be this many characters. it got to the point where i really didn't know who the protagonist was supposed to be. this ties into the next problem i have with this movie. way too much happens. the movie is three hours in length and it felt like i sat through an entire season of television after i saw it. i can't help but wonder if it was originally supposed to be a tv show that got reworked into a movie. also, while the pre intermission part was good(yes, this movie has an intermission), it really peaks after the intermission. the first half is not devoid of great moments because it has quite a few but you have to wait after the intermission to get to the really good stuff. and lastly, the movie just kinda...stops. it doesn't really end. it just stops. other then those problems, kalki 2898 AD is a solid action science fiction movie that managed to outdo most of the american blockbusters released during 2024. it shows that a movie doesn't need a popular IP or big name actors to be successful. all it needs is a talented director, writer, cast, and crew. if it weren't for the number 1 entree on this list, kalki 2898 AD would easily be number 1.

before we go to number 1, here are a few honorable mentions.

nightbitch: amy adams gives one of this year's finest performances as a woman on the edge of insanity in one of 2024's strangest movies. i went into this movie having never read the novel and having only watched the trailer. i didn't really know what to expect going in. but what i got was a brilliant psychological drama that mixes horror and comedy together into a perfect bow. although most of the cast gives excellent performances, let's not kid ourselves. this is amy adam's movie. after having not had the best decade and acting in numerous movies that are below her talent, adams finally gets to show off her skills in this movie. if not for the academy's notorious bias towards horror movies, adams would easily be a shoe in for at least a best actress nomination. nightbitch is a thoroughly unpredictable movie that will leave you guessing right up until the last second.

ultraman rising: while i've never been a huge ultraman fan and probably wouldn't have watched this movie if not for my father being a huge fan of the franchise, i did thoroughly enjoy ultraman rising. the animation is absolutely gorgeous. this movie is one of the best looking netflix animated movies we've gotten so far. the film also offers a new spin on the ultraman franchise, making ultraman act as a surrogate father to a baby kaiju that could rival baby yoda in terms of adorableness. i've only seen 4 of the 44 ultraman movies(holy shit! they made 44 of these damn things!) and this is, so far, my favorite.

conclave: edward berger really knocked it out of the park with 2022's all quiet on the western front. safe to say, he had a lot to live up to with his next directorial effort. well, it's safe to say that he not only lived up to the expectations that his previous movie set but actually surpassed them. this film tackles subject matter that we've never really seen before. the succession of the popehood. this is something that most people probably would never have thought to make a movie about. and thankfully, aside from the interesting premise, the film offers many more reasons to watch it. stanley tucci, john lithgow, and isabella rossellini are all at the top of their game in this movie. however, the scene stealer for me is ralph fiennes. i do not exaggerate when i say that fiennes not only gives the best performance in the movie but is also in the top 5 of my favorite movie performances of the year. throw in absolutely gorgeous cinematography and the best original musical score of the year and conclave is a movie that you will be glad you watched.

furiosa a mad max saga: the box office numbers can suck it! furiosa a mad max saga is an excellent action movie. i was thoroughly expecting this movie to make my actual list and it probably would have if not for kalki 2898 AD. nevertheless, furiosa is a thoroughly entertaining movie. while i don't like it as much as fury road, the film still has a lot going for it. the cinematography is amazing, the performances are really solid, the music is kickass, and the writing is really good. also, the film features dementus, who is second only to immortan joe as the best villain in the mad max series and is one of my favorite movie villains of the 2020s. my only real complaint with the movie is that it takes quite a while to get going. i mean, did we really need to see EVERY aspect of furiosa's childhood? other then that, furiosa is a really good movie that didn't get anywhere near the respect that it deserved.

inside out 2: when a sequel to inside out was first announced, i really didn't know what to expect going in. in my opinion, the first film was a perfectly self contained story that really didn't lend itself to sequels. however, when i saw the movie, i was absolutely astounded by how amazing it was. while i don't like it as much as the first movie, it's the best pixar sequel since toy story 3 and the best pixar movie since soul. it perfectly mixes humor and drama and is a perfect picture of teenage angst. not to mention, the film features anxiety, who is one of the best villains of the 2020s so far. i am worried that the quality of this movie will persuade pixar to focus more on sequels instead of original movies. hollywood has a history of learning the wrong lessons from successful movies. oh well, at least we got this really solid movie from it.

the bikeriders: this movie is basically goodfellas but with bikers. based on a true story, this movie tells the story of a violent biker gang. despite the characters being really shitty people, the movie does a solid job at humanizing them and making you empathize with them. tom hardy and austin butler give really good performances with hardy giving the best performance in the movie. it really is a shame that this movie is probably the closest we'll ever get to hardy acting in a quentin tarantino movie. the movie also has one of the best licensed songs soundtracks of the 2020s with an amazing mixture of songs on it. all in all, the bikeriders is a really good movie.

1: dune part 2

anyone who has read my post history probably could have seen this coming. my favorite movie of 2024 is dune part 2. as someone who loved dune part 1, my expectations were extremely high for part 2. and not only did part 2 meet those expectations, it actually managed to surpass them. pretty much everything that was great about part 1 is improved upon here. the acting, the writing, the cinematography, and the music. all the returning actors do amazing and the new actors also do good jobs. florence pugh makes the most of her brief screentime and christopher walken shows that, after all these years, he's just as talented as ever. but let's not kid ourselves. the highlight of this movie is austin butler as feyd rautha, a character who is sure to go down as one of the greatest movie villains of all time. prior to dune part 2's release, many said that, if it turned out to be successful, we will get more dune movies. well, i would call dune part 2 a success. so warner brothers, make with the other dune movies.

This is now my third year doing something like this, and I really enjoyed talking to people last year about where my movies fell versus where they felt things needed to land. There were definitely a few criticisms last year that I'd like to clear up beforehand:

* I do view myself as a ""typical moviegoer"" and don't see myself as a cinephile at all.
* My wife and I tend to go during the weekends at daytime hours, it's just our preference, which does limit us sometimes with movies that aren't as popular and are in their 3rd-4th week of a run.
* There are a lot of movies we'd like to see but don't get around to just because a smaller release happens during a time where we're very busy and don't get to the theater for a few weeks.
* Many of you were critical of the fact that I often took small naps during movies - It never bothered me, but I did find out that I was vitamin D deficient early this year, and taking vitamins has helped out a lot
* This list does include movies from 2023 that I either saw at the beginning of 2024, or we saw in 2023 after releasing my list last year.

**A Quick Note on Categories:**

Other than ""Favorite of the Year"" I don't particularly have other categories ranked top to bottom in terms of favorite. There are movies in the ""Enjoyed it, but Probably Wouldn't Watch Again"" category that I liked better than movies in the ""Enjoyed it and Would Watch Again"" category, but I prefer fun and more relaxed movies for multiple viewings.

# Favorite of the Year [Ranked in Order]

* **My Old Ass:** I expected to like this one, as a comedy. . .But I came out of the theater with tears in my eyes. Yea sure it's about a drug induced romp \[on the surface\], but as I get older I feel this one really spoke to me on a deeper level.
* **We Live in Time:** I don't know if I'll ever watch it again. It doesn't strike me as the type of movie that I am going to want to watch a second time, just because of the subject nature and how deeply sad it is. . .But it moved me pretty significantly as is the second time I've ever found myself crying at a movie theater.
* **Lisa Frankenstein:** I was surprised to learn some people really hated this one, because I think it was the perfect amount of fun. . and weird. . .and campy.

# I Enjoyed it and Would Watch Again

* **Deadpool & Wolverine:** It's just a fun love letter of a movie, right? I don't go to a Deadpool movie expecting everything to make sense. I just want a good old fashioned 4th wall breaking bromance, and this movie delivers.
* **Saturday Night:** The movie has a very frenetic energy to it and didn't give me a lot of breathing room to process different things going on, which is something that I typically don't enjoy. For some reason \[maybe it's the fact that I do watch SNL and kind of have that expectation anyway\] it just works, and I'd probably want to watch it again to see what nuances I might pick up on.
* **Inside Out 2:** Inside Out 2 does a far better job \[in my opinion\] of being a fun Disney sequel than Moana 2 does. I think I'd need to watch both entries of this franchise back to back to really decide which one I like better.
* **Heretic:** I don't know if I ever thought I'd see Hugh Grant in a horror movie like this. It hits all the notes that I expect from the genre, but I really liked the Book of Mormon x Horror vibe, and the almost chess like mentality his villain hits throughout the entire movie.
* **Fly Me to the Moon:** We live in a time where people just make shit up, so even though this takes place before the moon landing, it still sort of felt topical. . .Except it's also a very funny comedy.
* **Speak No Evil:** I'm writing this after writing a few other similar thoughts further down the list - Once again, another movie that feels totally ruined by the trailers. . Why do they keep doing this to us? Except it honestly doesn't even matter. The movie just works. . I'd watch it 10 more times just to see if I pick up on anything in the background.

# Enjoyed Far More Than I Expected

* **Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes:** I saw and enjoyed the first remake but have become disillusioned by the movies with each passing sequel. I really didn't think this would be very interesting, but was happily very surprised.
* **Civil War:** Given the political climate of The United States around the time that this started to promo/release, I was very nervous as to this one having a bullshit political agenda \[for either side\]. Given that it did not, and took steps to really make sure the audience couldn't try to pull an agenda out of it, I was able to fully enjoy the romp.
* **Gladiator II:** I'm getting sick of these 20 years later sequels and really had very low expectations for the movie. I don't think it's the amazing film my wife thinks that it is, but I was definitely. . .Entertained.
* **Trap:** I was really annoyed by the trailers for this movie, which seemingly gives away ""the big reveal"" and ruins the entire thing - Except they pull back that curtain very early in the movie, and it's a non issue. Really enjoyed this way more than I expected to.
* **The Fall Guy:** This is one of those movies I went into ready to be annoyed, because I had seen promos for it way too many times and was just sick of seeing that stupid trailer over and over again. I just had zero expectations going in and was pleasantly surprised. At the time of this blurb I think I've seen it 3 times, which is unusual for me.
* **Wicked:** Coming off the heels of Mean Girls. . And Dear Even Hanson. . And pretty much all modern Broadway movies, I had almost no expectations at all for this one. I love Broadway, and was ready to nap my way through it. . .Though Wicked definitely proved me wrong, that you can do a musical correctly.
* **The Iron Claw:** If you told me I'd ever feel bad for a jacked up Zac Efron I would have laughed at you, and yet here we are. The only thing that stops this from being a top contender for me is that technically it came out last year, though I saw it after that list.
* **Alien: Romulus:** I know I'll be crucified for saying this, but I've never seen a full Alien movie all the way through. It just wasn't ever my thing, though we both really enjoyed it. I have since wanted to make my way through a chronological of the entire series, though have found myself lacking time to get around to it.
* **I Saw The TV Glow:** This is a movie that I didn't expect very much from, other than having a weird nostalgia feel to it. I really enjoyed most of it, but as it started to get really trippy towards the end it lost me.
* **Twisters:** On the list of movies that I ever thought would get a sequel this far down the road? I mean Twister seems like an easy enough candidate with a very generic premise, but I never really imagined it would happen. . .And yet it works. . .It works because it's no more a sequel of Twister than any generic disaster movie is \[not\] a sequel to another generic disaster movie of the same disaster. . . Does that even make sense? I don't know, but it was fun.

# Enjoyed it, but Probably Wouldn't Watch Again

* **Here:** The movie is just different, unlike anything I've ever seen before. I don't know if the gimmick is worth a second viewing, but it captivated me on the first one.
* **Red One:** Generic holiday action romp, we've been getting a bunch of these in the last few years. Glad I saw it, don't regret the time spent. . .Might get 2-3 minutes of my time if I'm ever flipping through channels and it happens to be on.
* **A Real Pain:** If I wasn't limiting myself to 3 movies in ""Favorites of the Year,"" this would probably be number 4. . Though The ambiguity of the ending feels pointless \[there really isn't much to think about in that regard\]. 
* **Arthur the King:** This is probably the first movie that has ever made me legitimately cry. I walked out of the theater nearly bawling. I give it props for that, but I have no desire to subject myself to it again.
* **American Fiction:** I'd say the first 2 acts of the movie are almost perfect, but I really didn't care for the way they did the ending in multiple paths. Like. . I got it from an author perspective, but I just don't feel like it worked.
* **Challengers:** I think my wife has probably seen this 5 times since it came out. I don't know if I can watch it again. Its a slower moving film, which isn't really my thing - I enjoyed it, I liked it a lot actually, but I don't think I'll be returning to the couch to see it again.
* **Babes:** It's funny in the same way all of those comedies about a very specific situation being dramatized for comedy are funny. The movie works because its a premise that I haven't seen before. But I don't think the magic will work a second time.
* **Dune: Part Two:** Look, both Dune movies are very good. . And yea I've read the source material, but they're also very long and slow. I'm glad I saw it, but I don't need to watch it again.
* **The Bikeriders:** I'll be honest - I write these things at the end of the year, because I want to focus on the feelings of my experience, and not really the plot itself. . .And while I remember enjoying it, I also remember thinking it was very long; but other than that I couldn't give you much else.
* **Blink Twice:** Blink Twice covers some rough themes that people don't typically want to think about, but the movie works as a crazy drug induced thriller. There's a decent revenge payoff, and I go home happy.
* **Bob Marley: One Love:** No idea how accurate the movie is, but it's a fun ride.
* **Sonic The Hedgehog 3:** It's cute, just like the first 2. The story is pretty basic but I appreciate it's the type of movie that is made for kids, but the writers didn't forget that Sonic is a 90s icon, and that its older fans would be watching it too.

# The Mediocre Movie I Expected it to be

* **Beetlejuice Beetlejuice:** It hits a lot of the notes you need a sequel like this to hit, but I also felt like everything was reductive and surface level. We went with the in-laws, who loved it, but I didn't think it was that great.
* **Venom: The Last Dance:** Just like Venom 1 and 2 it has its moments - I'm not sure if 2 or 3 is the weaker movie, and I almost certainly will never watch it again, but I don't regret the time. . Or the laughs.
* **It Ends with Us:** I might be biased because my wife dragged me to this on the same weekend I dragged her to Borderlands, which maybe artificially props up my feelings of it - But I didn't totally hate it. 
* **A Quiet Place: Day One:** Is Day One necessary? Probably not. But I think it's definitely a better entry into this mythos than the sequel was.
* **Monkey Man**: Indian John Wick. . .It's decent, but nothing I haven't seen before.
* **Longlegs:** The movie isn't scary, and it's not really much of a thriller, but it certainly is creepy and Nicholas Cage has always played the weirdo card really well. . .Or that's just who he is.
* **Abigail:** It's just fun - There's nothing special about it - The reveal in the end isn't anything interesting, hell the ending itself is confusing with all the back and forth. But there are vampire ballerina kids, and that's just the kind of silliness we need sometimes.

# Expected More and Left Disappointed

* **MaXXXine:** Two years ago X was one of my top movies of the year. And even Pearl with all of its Wizard of Oz whimsy felt like a pretty strong movie. It's not that MaXXXine is a bad movie, I just expected more than a semi-generic horror/thriller. It felt as though the movie itself was written to be its own thing and the X mythos was just tacked onto it before shooting.
* **IF:** I don't really know what I was expecting with this one. . .But I always sort of hoped it would be some kind of Fosters Home for Imaginary Friends x Ryan Reynolds movie. It sort of just felt like too much was going on, and not enough was going on. . All at the same time.
* **Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire:** Afterlife may have been really reductive of previous Ghostbusters movies, but it was enjoyable and fun. Frozen Empire was just flat the entire time and at 2h4m it felt about 45 minutes longer than necessary.
* **The Book of Clarence**: I can't quite tell if this movie just wasn't for my particular audience, or if it just wasn't very good. But it felt very long and confusing the entire way through.
* **Imaginary:** Generic gimmick horror movie is generic gimmick horror movie. Nothing special, move along.
* **The Watchers:** I don't know why I expected more, that's stupid of me. I don't actually hate The Watchers, but I do think the whole ending is kind of stupid.
* **Y2K:** I wasn't expecting a masterpiece with this one, but I thought it would be a fun nostalgia trip. I do think the first 20-30 minutes are super solid, but once we start getting into the ""AI takes over the world"" problem the whole thing sort of just falls apart, and none of the payoff feels earned.
* **Moana 2:** The original is a true favorite of mine, but this one feels like it's exclusively for the kids. And that's totally fine, just wasn't for me.

# Didn't Expect Much, and Got What I Expected

* **The Crow:** I've actually never seen the original The Crow \[I know\] but I typically don't expect much from remakes/reimaginings anyway. There were parts that I ""didn't hate"" but overall it fell flat for me.
* **Mean Girls:** Mean Girls, the Broadway Show, is really good. This entire movie felt flat with a lot of the songs pushed into more monotone registers to makeup for hiring talent that didn't have very high vocal range. . Other than Renee Rapp. I also felt like a lot of the nods to the original movie were done in an ""ok fine we have to"" way, instead of honoring the source material.
* **The Front Room:** I didn't expect much. . Actually I don't know what I was expecting. . .Certainly it wasn't a seemingly ancient woman shitting herself constantly. It felt like The Front Room kept building to something that never paid off.
* **Immaculate:** Sydney Sweeny starring in ""i'm hot, oh but also I'm a nun that fucked up."" The movie has no substance to it and I was grateful when it was over. The only thing saving it from Worst of the Year is just how bad some of those movies are.

# Worst of the Year

* **Night Swim:** I liked the premise of this one and really wanted to like it, but it just felt like it was missing pretty much everything a good horror movie needs.
* **Madame Web:** This movie doesn't deserve my thoughts or punctuation
* **Borderlands:** I didn't expect Borderlands to be a good movie at all - It's one of my favorite game franchises and I had no hope that Hollywood wouldn't screw it up, but I was at least hoping for something that made sense and might hit the ""so bad it's good"" point. The movie is just bad, and oddly the one casting choice everyone thought made no sense \[Kevin Hart\] is the one casting choice that I felt actually worked.
* **Argylle:** This may be the worst movie I've ever seen, and I used to make a point to watch some of the worst movies \[as reviewed on IMDB\] as a fun group activity with friends. At no point in its incoherent rambling did Argylle make any sense, and I wish it would be erased from my brain.

**Note:** At roughly $23/m for the AMC subscription that means I spent about $5/ticket to see each movie. My wife sometimes do buy concessions \[sometimes with points, sometimes without\], maybe next year I'll track that too, just to see how expensive a hobby this actually is.

**Movies we will probably see in the next week:**

* Mufasa
* A Complete Unknown
* Nosferatu
* Babygirl",799,320,1734978131.0,2024-12-23 18:22:11,False
dune2,dune sequel,1govwl5,How do you feel about secret two-parter movies?,"The Harry Potter series started the trend of 2-parter finales with The Deathly Hallows Part 1 and Part 2. Drawing out the series for an extra film.

When that made endless money, other YA series followed suit with The Hunger Games and Twilight. Quickly the trend wore on audiences, to the point that Divergent's split 3rd book did not get it's Part Two made due to Part One being a disappointment.

With these disappointments, Marvel changed their Infinity War Part One and Two, to Infinity War and Endgame. 

Recently Dune was marketed and sold as Dune. Only for the first moment of the film to announce it as actually Part One of a series.

Mission Impossible marketed it's final films as Dead Reckoning Part One, but has now switched it's Part Two to The Final Reckoning, likely due to Part One's box office disappointment

Edit: I have also realised that Wicked is releasing as just Wicked, yet Wicked Part Two is expected next year

Edit 2: **YOU** Mr r/movies browsing cinema nerd may have known Dune was a Part 1. However the layperson would never know, and still wouldn't know even if they were to watcht the trailer, see it's posters, and buy a ricket, or buy the BluRay even today. Even next to eachother one could safely assume Part 2 is just a sequel, and not the other half of the story.

Do you think this is finally the end of movies telling us upfront that they are Parts? And how do you feel about Dune's approach of not telling you until you have purchased your ticket? ",0,103,1731341672.0,2024-11-11 16:14:32,False
dune2,dune sequel,1ge5n3t,"Opinion: I'm getting tired of ""Today's cinema is just sequels and reboots"" discourse.","Now i know that nowadays corporations like Disney or Warner tend to prefer IPs and franchises like Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Harry Potter etc. over original ideas and most of the time if they do that it result in flops (likely because the studios never believes in an original idea) and i know some people might getting tired of franchises and reboots of popular movies but just thinking cinema is now reduced to that is for me at least kind of an exageration.

First reboots always existed before the 2000s. For a few examples the 1990s Psycho trilogy or the King Kong movie of the 1970s or even Scarface with Al Pacino was in fact a remake of 1932 Scarface. Disney also did remake 101 Dalmatians back in the 90s and did 2 live action movies. Hollywood isn't much new to rehash old ideas and capitalize on it with nostalgia or just willing that the people will just go out to see it based on the title and what they're rebooting. Also they did out-of-time sequels of very old movies too like Return to Oz sequel to the Wizard of Oz (who also had some reboots and remakes over time) in 1985 exactly 40+ years after the original came out.

Second point is that there are always new ideas out there despite what there's on the market right now. On a side sure we have Avengers Doomsday & Secret Wars, new Star Wars movies and other franchise or IP related content. But on the other side there are movies or new IPs who i can see becoming cult movies in the next few decades whatever is an original idea or an already existing proprety or franchises that is just becoming popular now.

The Holdovers, Everything Everywhere All At Once, Terrifier, Dune, Superman and the whole new DCU, Mickey 17, Civil War, Challengers, The Bikeriders, Trap, The Last Airbender animated movie (which became popular during the pandemic thanks to Netflix) and literally every A24 movie. I can see people looking back on those movies in like 2040 and remember it like people grew up in the 80s remembered Star Wars or E.T. or Friday the 13th.

Then i could be wrong. I'm writing this after i saw a discussion like this on another sub who said exactly that and if you think that cinema is just sequels or reboots is totally fair and i'm not to try to convince everyone and just saying an opinion that can be wrong. But like i say i am just sick to see people pretend that there can't be any new idea or franchise beside already existing ones.

You can be free to express you thoughts but just remember be civil in express your thoughts and not be too harsh in responding ok ?",0,53,1730131138.0,2024-10-28 15:58:58,False

dune2,dune sequel,1eg2djc,2024's got a weird selection of movies,"Ok so this far we got sequels based on Planet of the Apes, Dune, Deadpool, Despicable me (missing many more), all that is standard stuff.

But the other stuff... What the hell is this?

A sequel to twisters of all things is random as hell. Good for action fans though.

Who in the mother of fuck was asking for a horror movie about goddamn tarot cards? Or a Blood and Honey sequel that retcons the original as a fictional movie inside the sequel... What.

IF also kinda has a random premise... What if imaginary friends were real?

Then there's the stuff coming later this year...

Why are we getting a Beetlejuice sequel?
Who was asking for a Lion King prequel starring Mufasa?
Animated films about LOTR and Transformers? Sure, why not?
A Pharrell biopic made out of LEGO? Why though
And Moana 2... First one was kinda average, so this isn't needed imo.

dune2,dune sequel,1e9e0ya,2021 was the best year of the decade for media.,"basically what the title says. i truly believe that 2021 has been the best year of the decade so far in regards to media. part of this is due to alot of stuff that was delayed from 2020 being brought into 2021. with things getting back to normal, we were given a myriad of content, most of it pretty solid.

let's start with movies. 2021 was a great year for cinema. not only were movie theaters starting to reopen but we also got some really solid releases. dune part 1, the power of the dog, spiderman no way home, the little things, pig, the mitchells vs the machines, nightmare alley, and numerous others. the 2022 academy awards was the first academy award ceremony in a while where i was actually in suspense about what film would win since most of the movies that were nominated were solid.

then there's television. 2021 was the year that the MCU started expanding into television. most of their television efforts were well recieved. then there's invincible, midnight mass, icarly, the underground railroad, arcane, and reservation dogs. of course, you can't talk about television in 2021 without talking about squid game, a series that came out of the blue but went onto become one of the biggest cultural milestones of the 2020s.

as far as video games are concerned, i'm not as educated on that since i'm more of a retro gamer. the most recent video game i own is mortal kombat 11 from 2019. however, i am aware that 2021 saw the releases of the long awaited sequel to psychonauts, hitman 3, resident evil village, and metroid dread.

now, as with every year, not everything was great. we got plenty of crap like the book of boba fett, thunder force, space jam a new legacy, chaos walking, and music. and then, there were projects which, while not bad, failed to live up to expectations. the biggest example of this is the many saints of newark, a film that tried to introduce the world of the sopranos to a new generation while being a mediocre gangster movie. however, 2021 was still a great year for media.",0,10,1721654110.0,2024-07-22 14:15:10,False
dune2,dune sequel,1e8ztyl,Thoughts on the Lord of the Rings trilogy,"These are some of the movies that I am most conflicted about. When I first saw them in the theater as a kid I was totally blown away and they became instant favorites. But I think that the more, I watch them, the less I appreciate them.

On the plus side, I think it is indisputable that the films are an enormous achievement. The visuals and music are absolutely stunning and alone make them rewatchable. Jackson absolutely nailed the feel of a fantasy world and there are countless moments of beauty throughout the films as well as great action scenes. The CGI has aged relatively well despite some minor moments and it does a great job of blending with the practical effects. The music is outstanding and fits the films perfectly. On audiovisual level the films are pretty near perfect. Now I know I will probably get a lot of hate for some of my criticisms.

The actors chosen for the parts also filled their roles well and for the most part the acting is very good. However, one thing that stands out to me more and more is how weak and bland the characters are. There is almost no character development across three long films. Once you've spent about five minutes with a character you know who they are. The story itself also doesn't have much intrigue. There is a great setup with the journey to destroy the ring and I was especially interested in the power the ring had over people but again this point is fully made in the first 90 minutes of the first film and then goes nowhere. The story ends up becoming about encountering some obstacles or battle and then moving on to the next one. These encounters are fun, and again visually stunning but it leaves you with nothing to think about.

In the original Star Wars trilogy, the writing actually does a great job of throwing all of these exciting creatures, ideas, and worlds at you without much exposition. In the LOTR trilogy almost everything is announced. There are so many lines just naming the next location or creature, you would think characters would know about.

The hardest part for me on re-watches is for lack of a better way of saying it, just how cheesy the films are. There are countless moments of teary-eyed characters making speeches with sad music playing. The Fellowship of the Ring is my favorite of the trilogy but there are several scenes that were tough to sit through like the slow motion crying after Gandalf's ""death"", Boromir's death speech (my captain, my king!) and Sam almost drowning to rejoin Frodo. The two sequels focus more on battles and build them up relentlessly with obvious dialogue and inspirational speeches.

Anyway, I know that I'm trashing the films now but the difficult thing is that there is much about these films that I really love. I am not expecting too much complexity from a fantasy/adventure trilogy but I think others like the original Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and the new Dune movies avoid these pitfalls.",0,47,1721604697.0,2024-07-22 00:31:37,False
dune2,dune sequel,1dwup0l,My Favorite Films of 2024 So Far (in alphabetical order),"**The Beast**: This is (pun not intended) a beast of a film that not everyone is going to vibe with and for some could be a bit impenetrable. Clocking at two and a half hours long, and with a story jumping centuries apart, Bertrand Bonello's film about the suppression of emotions be it from societal standards, technology, or social media and the consequences of said suppression isn't one I don't think I still quite fully grasp, at least not after one watch. But even still, from the great performances from Lea Seydoux and George McKay, to the gorgeous production design that's more provocative than some fantasy and sci-fi movies I've seen, to the writing and how the dialogue and editing of the film grapple dense themes. Again, this is not going to be for everyone but this is an experience no other film this year has matched and I'm interested in my reactions to it after a second watch.

**Challengers**: It's kinda bizarre in retrospect to say that Luca Guadagnino made a fun movie but yeah, Challengers is just that. I love the synthpop score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross as I love hearing their versatility as film composers. I love the cinematography of the film, not just in the Tennis matches, but all throughout; it is a gorgeous film to look at. I love the all three lead performances and the one-upsmanship being played. I love the story structure and how it builds and builds to probably my favorite ending to film this year so far. It's great, it's going to get nominated for a bunch of awards, you don't need me to reiterate how great it is.

**Civil War**: Is this film going to win awards from being the most politically accurate portrait of how a civil war in the U.S. would break out? Fuck no and yet that's not to say Alex Garland's best film since Ex Machina isn't great. Fantastic performances all around, particularly from Kirsten Dunst and Cailee Spaeny (the latter is quickly rising to being one of my favorite new actresses), I dug the subtle worldbuilding in the production design and cinematography, the chilling sound design and mixing should at least get this film awards - all the technicals of this are top notch. And a really engaging and tragic story highlighting the numbing and scarily passive warfare and war imagery has become. That even within your own country, senseless violence and destruction can be ignored if you put your head in the sand hard enough.

**The Devil's Bath**: A slowburn horror film that looks at the bleak emptiness of the world but not with any pomp and circumstance. It's an atmospheric film that puts you into that aura of depression most can fall into and - most daring of all - what it's like for a person to rationalize self-harm and suicide. It's a film that highlights how boring cosmic nihilism can often be the scariest thing: not only are you alone in a cruel world, there is nothing that's coming to save you, there is no God and you are stuck here until you die. It's not going to be for everyone as I can see even arthouse horror fans thinking this is too long and boring, but no film was as unsettling and disturbing as this and this sets a high bar for horror this year.

**Dune: Part 2**: I mean...it's Dune: Part 2

**Evil Does Not Exist**: I've been waiting to watch this film for months now and so glad I finally did. From gorgeous blue color pallette all over the film to the quiet pacing and evocative story that managed to actually say a lot about the balance of the natural good of both the environment and in human behavior, and how disruptions in either - even from good intentions - can lead to disaster quickly, it's incredible by how much is said through the smallest of actions. This is going to be a film to rewatch before the end of the year, maybe more than once, and I can't wait to do so.

**The First Omen**: Okay we seriously need an investigation into this film because how in the hell was big major studio horror movie - and a legacy sequel horror movie at that - allowed to kick this much ass? Incredible cinematography from Aaron Morton, a great performance from Nell Tiger Free (who nails *that* homage), and a fantastic debut from Arkasha Stevenson who immediately shows herself to be a horror director to keep a watch on with a great eye for atmosphere, again how did Disney allow a movie this cool to come out?

**Housekeeping for Beginners**: Family melodrama can actually be a bit hokey and overly staged if not written, acted, or staged well. Truth be told, I was a little hesitant before watching this film because I was afraid it'd be another overly heavy, overly dramatic movie about domestic relationships we've seen before but I'm so glad I gave this a shot. With great performances - highlights are Anamaria Marinca, Samson Selim, and especially Dzada Selim who's adorable throughout - it's a family drama that manages to be funnier than expected and touching with it's look at the messy but ultimately loving queer household that thrives not despite circumstances, but in spite of them.

**Hundreds of Beavers**: I've talked a bit about heavy complex films so why not highlight a good old fashion silent slapstick film. Despite the lowbudget nature, the movie is bursting with creativity not just with the props used but with the physical comedy, the sight gags both in the background and foreground, and the pacing of the film remaining engaging throughout it's almost 2 hour runtime. Without that steady hand, this could've felt long after the first couple of minutes but even though some jokes don't land as much as others do, the hit ratio far exceeds any stumbles and I can't wait to see Mike Chelchik's next movie. Maybe he can even do a Coyote v. Acme story!

**I Saw the TV Glow**: I am not trans and while I am pansexual, I've never had any resistance from my family or friends about my sexual or gender identity. And yet no film I saw this year hit me as hard as I Saw the TV Glow. From the gorgeous purple neon aesthetic, the charming throwback to 90s shows that I didn't even grow up on, to the Creepypasta-esque vibe of the story, to Jane Schoenbrun confident direction in recreating what it would mean for a trans person - or even any person - to never fully accepting their identity, and the longterm damage that could do, it's one of the most self-assured movies about identity I've seen in a while. I haven't stopped thinking this film since I saw it and I can't wait to see it again

**I Used to Be Funny**: Rachel Sennott is here to stay and hopefully with this film, I hope it's more than in just the typical screwball comedies. Ally Pankiw's is script is good as well with it feeling natural and off the cuff, and all the other actors are good as well, but this is Sennott's show through and through. From her chemistry with Olga Petsa to her portrayal of trauma and PTSD to her attempts to get back a person and relationship that can't ever return of what she's been through, it's a performance that deserves more attention. I've seen some push back against this film and it is a small story so if you don't connect with it, I get it. But I loved this film and Sennott's performance has to be seen.

**Inside Out 2**: The biggest movie of the year so far and hey for once, it's a big blockbuster that I loved unabashedly. I don't care what anyone says this film is better than the first. All the past emotions are fleshed out more while all the new ones given time to shine. The comedy is a lot sharper and snappy, the emotional scenes resonate and remain powerful even after an initial viewing. Most importantly, it does what the best sequels should do and that's progress the story forward. I've seen this twice in theaters and I'm most likely going to see this several more times in different circumstances and I'm not going to complain about that at once.

**Problemista**: This movie could've just been an hour and forty minutes of Tilda Swinton devouring the scenery in a wild Irish accent and I would still love it, but what's great about Problemista is more than just that one amazing performance. The style and editing of this film is creative and funny, the story is quietly engaging in highlighting the unfair economic mobility immigrants have to face, and the chemistry and interplay between Julio Torres and Swinton is genuinely charming and endearing. It immediately markrs Torres as a comedic voice to keep an eye on. No other film this year is going to make you smile with files being organized and sorted.

**Riddle of Fire**: Whimsy and the magic of childhood is a very hard thing to pull off, one wrong slip and you could easily fall into corny, schmaltz. But not only Weston Razooli's debut film doesn't just stick the landing in capturing that innocence and imagination with charm and humor, it manages does so with a lot of authenticity and sincerity. Fantastic performances from the children, great comedic writing, and a gorgeous storybook tone and aesthetic, this is a movie that should be be more a cult classic in the future. This should become a regular movie for families - or even anyone of any age.

**Sometimes I Think About Dying**: I admit that there was excitement in me to check out this film because I have had trouble socializing with others but there is more to this film that I love beyond it being a story I found relatable. From Daisy Ridley's incredible and subtle performance and hopefully the start of an indie run similar to Kristen Stewart, to the dreamy edits and music, to yeah the quiet story that perfectly captures how simply small talk and connections even in the office can be a bit difficult for some. I've seen a lot of people love this film for that reason but even if you aren't introverted and didn't struggle with social interaction, I recommend this film.

And those are my favorite films I've seen so far. There are movies like Love Lies Bleeding, Last Stop in Yuma County, Furiosa, Stopmotion, and Late Night With the Devil, that were close in making this list.

There are a bunch I've yet to catch but have heard a ton of good buzz around them like Thelma, Kinds of Kindness, Didi, The Substance, Anora, A Real Pain, A Different Man, Ghostlight, and so much more that I'm looking forward to. Not to mention a ton of interesting documentaries like Daughters and Black Box Diaries that I really hope get releases soon.

dune2,dune sequel,1dk8j54,It’s not the audiences want “original and unique” movies; it’s that they want events,"There’s a particular discussion I’ve heard amongst movie watchers, especially after the Barbenheimer phenomenon. 

After Barbenheimer, I heard so many people say things along the lines of….

“See, studios! People want original movies! That’s what will make us show up!”

“When will studios learn that we don’t want constant marvel and Star Wars, we want GOOD MOVIES.”

I think there is a major case of correlation not equaling causation. 

For one, let’s get this straight: Barbenheimer did not succeed so massively because of “originality”. It’s not that it deviated from the norm of blockbusters so much that it captivated audiences. Barbenheimer is an event that will be INSANELY difficult to replicate. We had two movies release on the same day that contrasted so much tonally that it was bound to capture people’s attention. People were entertained by the meme. Barbie is a MASSIVE franchise, and Christopher Nolan is basically a franchise himself. Any other directer does Oppenheimer and this event does not happen. People weren’t clamoring for original movies, they were clamoring for an EVENT. Something we as a community can relate over. It was a social experience that brought so many together. We wanted that post-Avengers: Endgame high. 

Frankly I get sick of the argument, “Audiences just want great movies.” Because I’m sorry, it will NEVER be as simple as that. If that were the case, then we wouldn’t have movies like Godzilla x Kong and The Super Mario Bros movie gaining giant success. 

The fact that Dune 2, one of the most unique and expertly directed blockbusters we’ve seen in years, will probably be outgrossed by Deadpool & Wolverine (an MCU movie after we’ve already had 1 billion of em; superhero fatigue amirite?) and Despicable Me 4 (a mediocre animated franchise film) shows that quality and uniqueness isn’t nearly as important as people would have you believe. 

Also, if you want a unique movie, vote with your wallet. No one went to see Furiosa, so we’ll probably not get a big budget Mad Max sequel like I really wanted. Don’t get mad at studios for pushing out crap when the crap is making money. If you want to see a new MCU or Avatar movie with your friends over some prestige drama, I have no hate for you. Hell I’d probably rather see Avatar in theaters, too. It’s an event and you spend your money how you want it. But like I said, don’t get mad at studios when they push out more of the same old same old when that’s what you’re gonna show up to most of the time.

Theaters are dying; there’s a reason every movie ad now says “It MUST be seen on a big screen.” These “event” movies bring people in.",0,25,1718880118.0,2024-06-20 11:41:58,False

Dune is such a great pay off of the set up the first movie has, while furiosa added depth to the world of fury road in a way I very much loved, and did it with a shit load of style and substance. I know the latter is pretty much a box office flop at this point but I can see the two competing come awards season in a few categories. Personally, I think I preferred furiosa. I think it's an outstanding movie and arguably one of the best prequel films of all time, though Dune part 2 is a rare sequel that eclipses its predecessor in all the right ways.

I  wonder if the actors get paid if studios use their face but don't hire  them.

I don’t know if other people enjoy watching it, but I certainly don’t. It’s not just hypnosis and mind control either. Sometimes trusted characters just turn bad like in Dune 2 and the Croods 2. ",0,9,1716673536.0,2024-05-25 22:45:36,False
dune2,dune sequel,1con25u,2024 has been a good year for movies so far.,"calling 2023 not a very good year for movies would be an understatement. numerous movies were negatively recieved and bombed at the box office, resulting in 2023 being a historic year for box office bombs. you know a year has not been very good for movies when it actually breaks records. safe to say, movie lovers were a bit skeptical going into 2024.

thankfully, 2024 has been a pretty solid year for movies so far.

january is notorious for being the month where studios release their crap. and while night swim was...not very good, the book of clarence was largely well recieved. the beekeeper also got some pretty solid reviews from critics. 

february saw the releases of orion and the dark bob marley one love, both of which were well recieved. however, not everything was great because that month also saw the releases of lisa frankenstein and the infamous madame web. february was also the month that drive away dolls came out, a movie that everyone was hoping would be really great but was just kinda meh.

march is when things really started to pick up. for starters, after two years of waiting, we finally got the long awaited dune part 2, a movie that was well worth the wait. the film was critically acclaimed and was extremely successful at the box office. as of the writing of this post, it is the highest grossing movie of the year. there was also the excellent thriller love lies bleeding, the coming of age comedy snack shack, the ghostbusters afterlife sequel ghostbusters frozen empire, and the giant monster movie godzilla X kong the new empire. 

april saw the release of monkey man, one of the most acclaimed directorial debuts and action movies in recent years. we also got the first omen, an omen prequel that no one was expecting to be any good but actually managed to surprise people. there was also guy ritchie's the ministry of ungentlemanly warfare, abigail, challengers, and boy kills world.

may has seen the release of the fall guy, which has recieved largely positive reviews. today, kingdom of the planet of the apes is releasing into theaters. later this month, we're getting IF and furiosa a mad max saga.

this year also has several other highly anticipated movies that have the potential to be really good. megalopolis, juror no 2, nosferatu, school fight, deadpool and wolverine, 4:30, the brutalist, kinds of kindness, maXXXine, the bikeriders, borderlands, alien romulus, nightbitch, and others.

so yeah. 2024, is shaping up to be a really solid year for motion pictures.",0,51,1715339758.0,2024-05-10 12:15:58,False
dune2,dune sequel,1civaxb,"Does this year's ""summer blockbuster"" lineup seem kind of....quiet? Low-key? Unhyped?","I love me a good set of Hollywood summer blockbusters. Yeah, they're shallow and bombastic and melodramatic, but they're fun.

But this year just seems to be kind of....meh?

At least, based on the movies here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_films_of_2024

Like, starting in May till the end of September:

* Turtles All the Way Down
* Fall Guy
* Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes
* IF
* Furiosa
* The Garfield Movie
* Bad Boys: Ride or Die
* Inside Out 2
* A Quiet Place: Day One
* Despicable Me 4
* Twisters
* Deadpool & Wolverine
* Borderlands
* Alien: Romulus
* The Crow
* Beetlejuice
* Transformers One

First off, there are decidedly fewer Marvel movies this year, which is fine with me. Also, none of the traditional big franchises that have dominated the last 20 years have anything (no Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts, no live action Transformers, no Fast & Furious, no Star Wars, etc.).

But also...there are a lot of sequels/revivals/remakes of seemingly random franchises from the 90s (and/or late 80s, if we're being technical), for some reason? The Crow, Bad Boys, Twisters, and Beetlejuice? Netflix is even getting Beverly Hills Cop 4. Are these drumming up ANY excitement?

And the rest seem pretty understated, especially compared to the mega-franchises of past years. Obviously Planet of the Apes, Furiosa, and Deadpool are the big ones. Maybe Inside Out 2, as well. A Quiet Place is great but it's not what you'd call a traditional summer blockbuster. And Borderlands and Alien: Romulus COULD be great....but we've hardly seen anything of them, and the last few Alien movies haven't exactly lit up a firestorm of excitement.

I dunno, maybe I'm just not paying that much attention this year, but when I remembered it was already May I realized that I had not thought AT ALL about what movies I was looking forward to this summer, and when I tried, I couldn't really think of any until I looked at Wikipedia.

Am I the only one who thinks this summer is going to be a pretty low-key one? Not necessarily bad, because I'm looking forward to enough of these movies that I'm now getting excited, but I don't see any of the typical movie fanbases in this year's lineup, and other than Dune 2 (which already passed), I don't see another big franchise catching on with the mainstream and developing a large following.",0,7,1714695944.0,2024-05-03 01:25:44,False

>To be fair to Villeneuve, it was never a given that there’d be a thirst for this franchise in the first place, and audiences went into *Part One* not knowing that they’d want a *Part Two* just as soon as it finished. *Part Two* would be an epic achievement from any other director, but it feels that there is something bigger, better and obviously more *decisive* to come in the third and hopefully final part of the trilogy. “This isn’t over yet!” says Chani, and if anyone can tie up this strange, sprawling story and take it out with a bang, Villeneuve can.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/dune-part-two-review-timothee-chalamet-zendaya-1235830061/):

>Running close to three hours, *Dune: Part Two* moves with a similar nimbleness to Paul and Chani’s sandwalk through the open desert. The narrative is propulsive and relatively easy to follow, Hans Zimmer’s score is enveloping, and Greig Fraser’s cinematography offers breathtaking perspectives that deepen our understanding of the fervently sought-after planet. All these elements make the sequel as much of a cinematic event as the first movie.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/dune-2-review-timothee-chalamet-denis-villeneuve-1235917934/) (80/100):

>Villeneuve treats each shot as if it could be a painting. Every design choice seems handed down through millennia of alternative human history, from arcane hieroglyphics to a slew of creative masks and veils meant to conceal the faces of those manipulating the levers of power, nearly all of them women.

[Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/dune-part-two-review-1234962710/) (90/100):

>The French-Canadian filmmaker has delivered an expansion and a deepening of the world built off of Herbert’s prose, a YA romance blown up to Biblical-epic proportions, a Shakespearean tragedy about power and corruption, and a visually sumptuous second act that makes its impressive, immersive predecessor look like a mere proof-of-concept. Villeneuve has outdone himself.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/dune-2-review-timothee-chalamet-zendaya/) (75/100):

>For those already invested in the “Dune” franchise, “Dune: Part Two” is a sweeping and engaging continuation that will make you eager for a third installment. And if you were a fence-sitter on the first, this should also hold your attention with a taut, well-done script and engaging characters with whom you’ll want to spend nearly three hours.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/dune-part-two-movie-review-1234955419/) (C):

>The pieces on this chess board are so big that we can hardly even tell when they’re moving, and while that sensation helps to articulate the sheer inertia of Paul’s destiny, it also leads to a shrug of an ending that suggests Villeneuve and his protagonist are equally at the mercy of their epic visions. No filmmaker is better equipped to capture the full sweep of this saga (which is why, despite being disappointed twice over, I still can’t help but look forward to “Dune: Messiah”), and — sometimes for better, but usually for worse — no filmmaker is so capable of reflecting how Paul might lose his perspective amid the power and the resources that have been placed at his disposal.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1522684/dune-part-two-review/) (7/10):

>Perhaps viewing the first ""Dune"" and ""Dune: Part Two"" back-to-back is the best solution, but I suspect most people aren't going to do that — they're going to see a new movie. And what they'll get is half of one. Maybe that won't matter, though. Perhaps audiences will be so wowed by that final act that they'll come away from ""Dune: Part Two"" appropriately stunned. And maybe whenever Villeneuve returns to this world — and it sure seems like he wants to — he can finally find a way to tell a complete story.

[Inverse](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/dune-2-review):

>“In so many futures, our enemies prevail. But I do see a way. There is a narrow way through,” Paul tells his mother at one point in the film. Like Paul’s vision of the future, there were many ways for *Dune: Part Two* to fail. But not only does it succeed, it surpasses the mythic tragedy of the first film and turns a complicated, strange sci-fi story into a rousing blockbuster adventure. *Dune: Part Two* isn’t a miracle, per se. But it’s nothing short of miraculous.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/movies/dune-part-two) (8/10):

>Dune: Part Two expands the legend of Paul Atreides in spectacular fashion, and the war for Arrakis is an arresting, mystical ride at nearly every turn. Denis Villeneuve fully trusts his audience to buy into Dune’s increasingly dense mythology, constructing Part Two as an assault on the senses that succeeds in turning a sprawling saga into an easily digestible, dazzling epic. Though the deep world-building sometimes comes at the cost of fleshing out newer characters, the totality of Dune: Part Two’s transportive power is undeniable.

[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/dune-part-two-review-zendaya-timothee-chalamet-b2499855.html) (100/100):

>Part Two is as grand as it is intimate, and while Hans Zimmer’s score once again blasts your eardrums into submission, and the theatre seats rumble with every cresting sand worm, it’s the choice moments of silence that really leave their mark.

[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/dune-part-two-review/) (5/5):

>The climax here is sharply judged, sustaining what worked on page while making the outcome more discomforting. It’s a finale that might throw off anyone unfamiliar with Herbert, or anyone expecting conventional pay-offs. But it does answer the story’s themes and, tantalizingly, leave room for more. Could Herbert’s trippy Dune Messiah be adapted next, as teased? Tall order, that. But on the strength of this extravagantly, rigorously realized vision, make no mistake: Villeneuve is the man to see a way through that delirious desert storm.

[Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/e/23842690) (93/100):

>Dune: Part Two is exactly the movie Part One promised it could be, the rare sequel that not only outdoes its predecessor, but improves it in retrospect… One of the best blockbusters of the century so far.

[Screenrant](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dune-part-two/https//screenrant.com/dune-part-2-movie-review/) (90/100):

>Dune: Part Two is an awe-inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi spectacle and a devastating collision of myth and destiny on a galactic scale.

[RogerEbert.com](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dune-part-two-movie-review-2024) (88/100):

>Dune: Part Two is a robust piece of filmmaking, a reminder that this kind of broad-scale blockbuster can be done with artistry and flair.

dune2,dune sequel,18zrws2,New movies that set up plot that the sequels totally abandon.,"This is one of my least favorite trends in modern movies. The one that sticks out in my mind the most is IT and IT: Part Two. Friendships and relationships are set up in the first film and engage the audience, and then whoops, sorry. We focus grouped and decided to cut it to make more time for what we think people want to see the  most. It's so dumb because you can tell the studio is hoping that people won't notice. It feels very desperate

I'm having trouble thinking of other movies that did this, but it's usually movies that are made with the understanding that there will be sequels. I think Twilight is another example of this, which I know: Big surprise. But this is definitely something that happens a lot in movies right now, and it always leaves me with my jaw on the floor. Like: Really?! I'm worried Dune: Part II might do this :(",0,27,1704516959.0,2024-01-06 04:55:59,True
dune2,dune sequel,18x6rmy,What are some PG13 movies that should’ve been rated R?,"My picks are Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox and several other DC animated films. The film was extremely bloody and graphic for a PG13 movie. Not just that, but several other DC animated films were just as bloody and violent and still got PG13 ratings. Examples: Justice League: The New Frontier, The Dark Knight Returns, Son of Batman etc. And not a DC film but Venom and its sequel. I also think that the Dune film should’ve been R because there is some stuff in the book that would not give it a PG13 remake and had some extremely violent moments.",0,36,1704245637.0,2024-01-03 01:33:57,True

10: asteroid city

after the disappointment that was the french dispatch, i was cautiously optimistic about wes anderson's followup to that movie. thankfully, anderson managed to redeem himself with, what is in my opinion, one of his best movies to date. asteroid city is a very unique movie with a very unique style of storytelling that i feel that only anderson could pull off. it's also a very beautifully shot movie. actually, behind the grand budapest hotel, it might be anderson's best looking movie to date. if this movie does not get at least a cinematography nomination at the academy awards, i will be very disappointed. the film is also very funny and there were quite a few laugh out loud moments. the film is also a deep examination about art and i feel that this film was basically wes anderson's thesis on why he does what he does. the film is only at number 10 because, with a few exceptions, the performances are kinda iffy. the performances in wes anderson movies always tend to be very stony with a few notable exceptions. the performances aren't bad and there are some truly excellent performances but overall, the performances don't really stand out too much. otherwise, asteroid city is a really solid movie.

&#x200B;

9: cocaine bear

gangsters, park rangers, and CGI bears? what's not to love? cocaine bear seems like a movie that would only be entertaining due to being absolutely ridiculous. and while it most certainly is ridiculous, it does offer other things aside from just that. in addition to being a movie about a bear that goes on a cocaine fueled rampage, the film is also an honest to god crime comedy. the characters are pretty well developed and, while most of the characters are pretty shitty people, it's not hard to at least understand them. this is helped by the good performances. christian convery, ray liotta, margo martindale, and isiah whitlock jr in particular stood out. and then of course, there's the bear in the room. how is it that fucking cocaine bear has better CGI then most of the superhero movies that came out in 2023? seriously! while it is obvious that the bear is CGI, it's still pretty awesome looking. and although i sadly neglected to mention him in the performances, kudos to allan henry for his excellent and believable performance as the bear. the humor in the film is also solid. in addition to just how over the top the violence is(seriously, the people in this movie don't just die. they fucking suffer!), there are also quite a few moments of humor seperate from the violence and those moments are pretty good to. some of the funniest moments happen between the little girl and her young friend who are actually surprisingly well written and well acted. 2023 was the year of over the top violent comedy movies and cocaine bear was the best of them. it's also a major step up in quality from elizabeth bank's last directorial effort. but then again, just about anything is an improvement over THAT.

&#x200B;

8: nimona

i really didn't know what to expect going into this movie. i had just seen a few ads for it on tiktok. however, i remembered certain things about it. a shapeshifting girl teaming up with an adult male. that stuck in my head and made sure that i would remember it. then, i actually watched the movie and...it was pretty damn good. it was an adventure movie full of humor, heart, action, and social commentary. despite being rated PG, the film tackles some really heavy themes. questioning authority, nature vs nurture, and self harm. this is a modern kids movie where someone tries to kill themselves and it's taken dead seriously! nimona is easily my favorite movie character of the year and one of my favorite movie characters of all time. she is funny, witty, and emotionally complex. the other characters are pretty amazing to including the director who is one of the best movie villains of the decade so far. my only complaint about the movie is that there isn't more of it. i really do hope they make a sequel because, now that i have nimona in my life, i can't live without it.

&#x200B;

7: godzilla minus one

whenever a godzilla movie is set to release, be it an american production or a japanese production, it will instantly make my list of anticipated movies of the year. and i've been pretty spoiled this year. not only have we gotten the excellent monarch series this year but we also got godzilla minus one. as if i should have expected anything else from one of the most acclaimed directors currently working in japan, godzilla minus one is a solid movie that not only gives us everything we love about godzilla but also gives us some really solid human drama as well. as i watched the movie, i couldn't help but feel as though it had a similar tone to the original godzilla, which can only be a good thing since the original godzilla is excellent. as i watched the movie, it was obvious to me that this movie was made by someone with a deep appreciation for godzilla and sure enough, the director has confirmed that he was greatly influenced by the original godzilla. this film also gets bonus points for featuring the evilest depiction of godzilla i've ever seen. rather then just going on a rampage and having everyone around him be collateral damage, he actively hunts humans. that is terrifying and so awesome at the same time. godzilla minus one is a candidate for being in my top 10 favorite godzilla movies in the entire franchise.

&#x200B;

6: the killer

when you hear that the killer is about a hitman, you're probably expecting a john wick esque action thriller about an unstoppable killing machine who kills anyone and anything in his path. well, the newest film from director david fincher is as far from that as it's humanly possible to get, to the point where it could almost be considered the anti john wick. at it's heart, the killer is a deconstruction of typical assasin movies, taking every trope you generally associate with these types of movies and going in the complete opposite direction. and the most impressive thing about the killer is just how engaging it manages to be while doing so. the film is a suspenseful movie where you have no idea where the plot is going to go. the titular killer himself is also a very interesting character. he is cold, calculating, and remorseless. and yet, he goes through a character arc where he starts to question why he does the things he does and often questions his own set of morals. michael fassbender gives one of 2023's best performances as the killer but everyone else does pretty good in their roles as well. the film is extremely slow paced which could be a turn off. however, if you stick with the movie, you will be rewarded. (PS: you gotta love end of the year lists. they're the only place where a movie like the killer and a movie like nimona can get mentioned together.)

&#x200B;

5: poor things

yorgos lathimos is on his way to creating a reputation for being the terry gilliam of the new generation. like gilliam, his films are extremely absurd but have quite a bit of heart to them. and no film he has done makes a better case for that then poor things. poor things is a very strange movie but, if you're willing to look past the absurdity of it's premise, you'll find a funny, emotional, and well acted movie. easily the funniest movie of the year, poor things features quite a few funny moments throughout, mostly courtesy of the deadpan and bluntness that is prevalent in lathimo's movies. the film is also a very gripping emotional journey. star emma stone said that what attracted her to the project was the fact that she felt that it was a parallel to the journey of being a woman. and yeah, i can see that. the film also has quite a few good performances throughout. emma stone gives 110 percent to the point where, if margot robbie and lily gladstone weren't the forerunners for the best actress oscar, stone would be an easy win. mark ruffalo also goes all in with the comedy, giving one of his best performances. and of course, there's the legendary willem dafoe. how does he do? it's willem dafoe! how do you think he does? however, the three real stars of the movie are the cinematography, the production design, and the makeup. in regards to the cinematography, this is probably one of the best looking movies of the year and, if i was judging my favorite movies of the year based solely on how pretty they look, this movie would be WWAAYY higher on the list. the production design could best be described as if tim burton directed a movie set in the grand budapest hotel universe. and the makeup is really eye catching and well handled. all this stuff combined leads poor things to be a solid recommend from me.

&#x200B;

4: spiderman across the spiderverse

saying that 2023 has been a rough year for superhero movies would be like saying that the titanic has some water damage. most of the superhero movies that have come out in 2023 recieved mixed to negative reviews with most leaning more towards the ladder. and even generally well recieved movies like blue beetle bombed pretty freaking hard. indeed, it seems like this sub genre that once practically printed money is slowly starting to fall out of favor. however, for every rule, there is an exception. there are 2 superhero movies this year that everyone can safely agree were successes. guardians of the galaxy vol 3 and spiderman across the spiderverse. and of both these solid movies, spiderman across the spiderverse has made the list. have you ever gone into a movie with high expectations and still ended up blown away? that was basically my experience watching spiderman across the spiderverse. as amazing as spiderman into the spiderverse was, this movie did the unthinkable and managed to be even better then the first film. literally everything is an improvement. the animation, the characters, the writing, the humor, the drama, the everything. it really is amazing just how all out they went with this movie. if this movie gets nominated for best animated feature, the other nominees may as well not even show up to the ceremony. but most importantly, this movie should serve as a lesson to superhero movies in the future. make less movies and make better movies.

3: the creator

one day, my best friend called me after i got off work and said if i wanted to see the creator. i hadn't really planned on going out of my way to go see it but i figured why not and said yes. and let me tell you, i'm glad that i did accept that invitation because the creator is excellent. this movie boasts some of the best cinematography and visual effects of any movie made during this year or even this decade. the acting is amazing with madeleine yuna voyles and ken watanabe being stand outs. i mean, the film isn't perfect since the story could have used a little tweeking and the morals are all over the place but it's such a well made movie that i can't help but sing it's praises. although i am extremely bummed out that dune part 2 got delayed, the creator filled the dune shaped hole in...i couldn't even finish that sentence. the only thing that will satisfy my dune part 2 lust is dune part 2. the creator is still good though.

&#x200B;

2: killers of the flower moon

brad jones of cinema snob fame described killers of the flower moon as ""heaven's gate if it was set in the goodfellas universe"". although i haven't seen heaven's gate, i do get what he was trying to say. but even without that comparison, killers of the flower moon is still a great movie. it takes an obscure part of american history that few people have heard of and even fewer know a whole lot about, and turns it into a steller crime thriller about the nature of evil. the movie is extremely hard to watch with numerous scenes of raw emotion and extreme violence, neither of which are surprising consider this is a Scorsese movie. the film is utterly unpleasant yet it's impossible to turn away. the film is also one of the most well acted movies of the year. leonardo dicaprio gives an excellent performance as the lead, lily gladstone manages to stand out in a movie with a whole bunch of talented actors, robert de niro shows that he's still got it, and even the minor actors like brenden fraser and john lithgow take their small performances and make meals out of them. my only real problem with the movie is it's pacing. the film is three hours in length with isn't inherently a bad thing. the problem is that it's pacing is extremely sluggish and it goes on way longer then it has to. the story ends an hour before the movie does. otherwise, killers of the flower moon is still an amazing movie. while i'm not quite sure if i would call it one of scorsese's best, it's easily the best movie he's made during this decade so far. i love you irishman but this movie is just much better.

&#x200B;

1: oppenheimer

what else could it have been? christopher nolan's oppenheimer is one of 2023's most acclaimed movies for a very good reason. it's excellent. it's though provoking, well shot, amazingly acted, and absolutely emotionally draining. i went to go see it with my dad and we both left the theater feeling absolutely numb. this is the type of movie that will make you feel emotionally drained in all the right ways. given the current political climate as well as all the crap happening outside our country, it's also a movie that couldn't have come at a more relevant time. it's so crazy when you think about it. this movie is the best movie of the year but it has very little action in it. well, the best movie of the year probably would have been dune part 2 but that ship has kinda sailed. nevertheless, christopher nolan has delivered yet another amazing movie, further cementing his reputation as one of the best filmmakers of this generation. his films are among the only ones that actually manage to live up to, or even surpass, people's expectations. we don't know what kind of movie he's going to make but, after oppenheimer, it's safe to say that expectations are extremely high. and knowing nolan, he's probably gonna surpass them.

dune2,dune sequel,17giqd5,What are your favorite movies?,"My list of underrated movies:

 

1. ""Stage Door"" (1937) - all my favorite film & TV actresses are in it. And I relate to all the main and supporting characters, in different ways. Katharine Hepburn, Lucille Ball, Andrea Leeds, Gail Patrick, and Andrea Leeds stole the show for me. This is my 2nd favorite movie of all-time, behind:
2. ""Peyton Place"" (1957) - Still ahead of its time. I grew up in a small town, extremely similar to Peyton Place (which is based on the book's author, Grace Metallious', real life small town in New Hampshire).
3. ""Marriage Story"" - I was furious when Adam Driver was nominated for an Oscar and didn't win. He gave the best performance of his career in this one; he's a true star & such an underrated actor.
4. ""Call Me By Your Name"" (2017) - Timothee Chalamet's first dramatic role; Elio (his character) endures a wide range of emotions, and this film is one of his best performances of his career. I watched the first 70 minutes of ""Dune"" (since my DVD player stopped, halfway through the movie) and CMBYN is much better than ""Dune"", although the open world of ""Dune"" is visually stunning. TC also deserved an Oscar win for CMBYN, and he was also robbed of an Oscar, just like Adam Driver was. At that point, I stopped watching the Oscars - younger dramatic actors (meaning under 45) don't get the respect & accolades anymore. (Maybe I should do some YouTube movie reviews or something)
5. ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940) - Lucille Ball is my favorite actress of all-time, but my favorite film actresses are a tie between Katharine Hepburn, Ann Miller and Lana Turner. KH truly shines as Tracy Lord; I once heard a reviewer say, ""Katharine Hepburn \*is\* Tracy Lord!"" I couldn't agree more.
6. ""Gone With The Wind"" (1939) - If resilience was a person, it'd be Vivien Leigh; a friend of Vivien's said about her, that ""She's equally Blanche DuBois, as she is, Scarlett."" Art imitates life.....
7. ""The Men"" (1950) - Marlon Brando & Teresa Wright were wonderful in it; Brando was almost \*too\* great; it made me think he mistreated women that way in real life, the way he mistreated Teresa's character. From Rita Moreno to all his ex-wives, I suspect ""The Men"" has subliminals about Marlon's misogyny toward women (which is all I thought of, when watching the movie - and I've seen the movie 3 times).
8. ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" - My personal favorite of Marilyn Monroe's iconic body of work. I loved she and Jane Russell in this - they were almost like Lucy Ricardo & Ethel Mertz (from ""I Love Lucy"") of the silver screen.
9. ""Sex & The Single Girl"" (1965) - It's been awhile since I saw it, but I remember absolutely loving it. I have a bit of a man crush on Tony Curtis myself. My mom (who's never seen a Natalie Wood movie in her life) even watched the movie. She said it's now her favorite Natalie Wood film. I saw ""West Side Story"" & ""Miracle on 34th Street"" as a kid, and loved both those films too, but SATSG is probably my favorite; did Natalie do more dramatic roles, besides SATSG?
10. ""Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows"" & its sequel, ""The Trouble With Angels"" - Rosalind Russell (who was Catholic in real life) and a young Hayley Mills are truly legends. Roz Russell is one of my all-time favorite actresses too, and she was born for comedic roles. And I enjoy Hayley Mills in this, as (the fake name she uses still makes me laugh) ""Fleur De Lie"" - both the first film and the sequel are 2 of my favorite '60s films. A shining example of physical comedy! I think those 2 films walked, so ""Sister Act 1 & 2"" could fly.
11. ""My Man Godfrey"" (1936) - The first Carole Lombard film I ever saw. I knew Gail Patrick from ""Stage Door"", so I was used to her typecasted role as the femme fatale and Irene's sister. I hated Gail as Linda in ""Stage Door"" - looking back now, my mother (in real life) \*became\* Linda; maybe that's why? But I absolutely loved Gail in MMG. And MMG is very much so Carole's best role; William Powell was great in this one, too. I think the fact that William & Carole were exes at that time, makes the movie 5 times funnier!
12. ""Mildred Pierce"" (1945) - This is a 5 star movie & Joan Crawford's greatest role. Eve Arden & Ann Blyth stole the show for me, personally. The famous scene where Mildred & Vida - shall we say - ""express choice words"" and Mildred says, ""Get out before I kill you!"" still (and I watched this movie for the first time as a 9 year old, way back in 2005, on TCM) - it still sends chills down my spine, that's how timeless this movie is! MP is the only noir film that keeps me guessing throughout; no other noir film really keeps me interested, except ""Sunset Boulevard"" - which I forgot to list, is also one of my favorite movies; Gloria Swanson is also extremely underrated and I always recognize her by her iconic eyebrows. I always say, ""I know those eyebrows - that's Gloria Swanson!""",0,11,1698277136.0,2023-10-26 00:38:56,True

I went through data from 30 different websites for **almost 5000 movies**. The sites included critics sources like Sight & Sound (both critic and director lists) / TSPDT to American sites like Rotten Tomatoes / IMDb / Letterboxd / MovieLens / RateYourMusic to international sites like FilmAffinity / Douban / Filmweb / CSFD. Overall, this was able to achieve a more well-rounded and internationally representative list.

I weighted websites according to their relative SimilarWeb ranking and number of votes. I removed movies that had <5k votes on IMDb, as these had low numbers of votes across the board, and adjusted ratings if a film was review-bombed. There remains work to be done though; building a platform that provides real-time rankings and data of every single movie ever released is the ultimate goal.

dune2,dune sequel,15cfsqa,delaying the release of dune part 2 to next year would be an incredibly stupid idea.,"the highly anticipated sequel to 2021's dune is currently slated for a november 2023 release. however, as a result of the strike, warner brothers is considering delaying the release to 2024. let's go over why this would be an incredibly stupid thing to do.

firstly, warner brothers needs a moneymaker right now. their last few superhero movies have not done very well at the box office with the flash having recently ended it's theatrical run having made less then green lantern, one of the biggest superhero movie bombs of all time. suffice to say, they are in desperate need of a hit and dune part 2 will be just that. a sequel to one of warner brother's most acclaimed movies in recent years will practically print money. and with numerous projects being delayed, warner brothers needs all the cash they can get. as such, warner brothers literally cannot afford to delay this release. in fact, i'd even go so far as to say that they should be moving the release date UP.

secondly, delaying the release is only going to make the movie going public angry. delaying the release of an already completed movie that numerous people are super excited for when it's only a few months away from release will only serve to make people angry at them. and they don't even have the pandemic to use as an excuse. numerous movies are releasing during the strike right now so the strike isn't an excuse either.

the only logical reason i could see for them doing this was if it was a deliberate ploy to make people angry at the strikers so that the public will be on the studio's side. well, that won't work because most people know how to direct their anger towards the people who deserve it. the public will be angry but they will be angry at the studios and not the strikers. and it will only serve to make the public rally behind the strikers even more because now, the studios are resorting to extremely petty methods of retaliation. what are we? 12?

any way you slice it, pushing back the release date of dune part 2 is a really dumb idea. warner bros has nothing to gain but everything to lose by doing this. they are idiots for even considering doing it and they will be even stupider if they actually do it. the fact that the person who proposed that idea was not immediately fired is honestly baffling.",0,10,1690595601.0,2023-07-29 02:53:21,True

I’ve been on a Denis Villeneuve kick lately after recently watching Dune and Blade Runner 2049 again.  I decided to check out his back catalog.  He’s an amazing visual storyteller.  I noticed that Sicario had a sequel made without him so I’m wondering if it’s worth watching.  Is it anywhere near as good as the first movie?",39,59,1689022756.0,2023-07-10 21:59:16,True

dune2,dune sequel,1357hwu,"Seriously, why don’t they make an animated version of Jodorowsky’s Dune?","Now we have Villeneuve’s version of Dune. It’s epic, it’s successful, and it is basically the book. We’ve had a television version, and we’ve had the weird David Lynch verse which is the unhappy medium between the book and the surreal. 

Knowing that we essentially have all the design and the entire movie storyboarded, with casting planned gor the leads, what’s stopping it ftom being made? Even Jodorowsky himself suggested it in the documentary.

Design the Emperor to look like Dali! Get Mick Jagger to voice Feud Rautha! Have Maurice laMarche do his Oraon Welles impression for Baron Harkonnen!

Yes, the movie would be psychedelic and bizarre and very different from the book. But now that we’ve had a solid version of the book on film, why not a wacky adaptation? It wouldn’t be Herbert’s but it was a movie conceived when only one of the sequels even existed. Herbert sold the rights to that team, and so why not?

In a world where we have Richard Donner’s Superman II and Zack Snyder’s Justice League, and even Kubrick’s Napoleon being realized, it would be an awesome thing to actually make this film a reality.",0,22,1682990891.0,2023-05-02 02:28:11,True

There's something about a big spectacle popcorn event that I can go to with the family and enjoy the show. My problem right now is that there is nothing coming up to really look forward to.

Marvel is slowly dying off for me. The last time I absolutely HAD to go to a Marvel movie was Endgame. Since then I've been disappointed in every one of them and now I just try to catch the newer movies on Disney+. The last Star Wars movie I loved was Rogue 1. I was really excited for TLJ, didn't like it, and suffered through whatever the last movie was called. And I watch the series without any real energy. Even Andor, the best of the lot, seemed to have some strange plotting choices with the heist followed by the prison. And then it just kind of ended. In the 2000s, I had a Harry Potter movie to look forward to every year. 

In late 2014 I saw the trailer for The Force Awakens and COULDN'T WAIT to see it the next year. In 2016 I watched Captain America: Civil War and absolutely loved it. But now, in 2023, the only thing I'm kind of looking forward to is the Dune sequel. But, really, it's not the same thing.

dune2,dune sequel,y4dg2s,The Problem With Sequel Trilogies,"I recently watched Halloween Ends, the conclusion to the Halloween sequel trilogy made up of Halloween (2018), Halloween Kills, and Halloween Ends. All are direct sequels to Halloween (1978) and ignore all other installments. After seeing Ends, the movie made me realize the problems with trilogies these days, especially sequel trilogies. 

The first two films usually feel really close together, with the second film a lot of times being a direct result of the end of the first film. Then the third film comes along and it’s just so different. Sometimes it’s a time jump, sometimes it’s a different setting than the other two, but the main point is, the third film usually feels different. I think the reason for this is that studios nowadays are too scared of one thing, the reception of the second film. For example, Jurassic World was well received by critics and made a lot at the box office, while it’s sequel, Fallen Kingdom, made less and was not as well received. Star Wars: The Force Awakens was also very well received by audiences and critics, while its sequel, The Last Jedi, was drastically more divided. Halloween (2018) was thought to be the best Halloween sequel and became the highest-grossing slasher film upon release, while Halloween Kills was received more negatively. 

The problem studios have with trilogies now is that the second film always goes out of its way to having its ending set up the third film, making the second film feel incomplete. There are plenty of second films that set up the third film well while completing their own story, but a lot of movies have gotten lazier at this, especially Halloween Kills. Because of this, the second film has a good chance at being received to a more mixed reception, causing the studio to panic. They think, ""People didn’t like the second one, we have to make the third one a lot more different."" 

This one thing is ruining trilogies. They set up the third film with a mediocre second film, and then get scared when that second film isn’t as well received as the first one, so the third film is this awkward outlier that feels completely different from the first two. That happened with this Halloween Ends. No matter what the director or anyone on the crew says, the reception of Halloween Kills changed this movie. I feel like if that movie was better received, there wouldn’t have been this big time jump and all three movies in the Halloween sequel trilogy would have taken place on the same night, or at least on the same weekend. 

When making a trilogy, there needs to be a complete idea that is stuck to regardless of how the films are received. I think small changes are fine, but there needs to be a limit. Even if they’re all bad, at least they’re all consistent. I think studios should strive more towards making duologies when making legacy films, as it’s easier to tell a complete story in two films than it is with three. That’s why I’m happy Dune is getting a two-film adaption instead of them trying to cut it into three movies somehow. Both Blade Runner films are amazing alone and even better together, and I think both Top Gun films play to their own strengths, and together make a really good double feature. If there are only going to be two Top Gun films, I’m completely fine with that. The Tron films are also a good example of a movie and it’s legacy sequel making up a duology. As for the Halloween series, for me, the only two films that are canon are Halloween (1978) and Halloween (2018).",0,18,1665804760.0,2022-10-15 04:32:40,True

dune2,dune sequel,x2x4hb,Post-Marvel movies and The Northman,"This post is not really about The Northman. It's about the landscape of modern cinema. I'd like to hear what folks make of the current situation. If you hate The Northman and are triggered just by seeing its title then please take your kneejerk negativity elsewhere. Thank you.

That said...

We live in a post-Marvel world. It was fun while it lasted, but the shine has worn off and now that massive, CGI-fuelled, episodic phenomenon is over. In its wake has come a slew of wannabes and copycats and otherwise abject bloated duds, including Marvel's own new phase, but also a handful of very fine films, some of which have been relative commercial successes like Dune, but some like The Northman have flopped in spectacular fashion. This is not a new phenomena per say, but considering the current situation it is more worrying now than ever.

I've had loads of discussion about these kinds of films, but especially about The Northman, and everyone has their own theory it seems. Some say it was too dark, too artsy. Some say it should have been darker and artsier. Some people claim it lacked action while others say it was too violent. Some say it was gorgeous while others found it dreary. It has its fans of course, I love the film and am still confounded as to how it wasnt a massive success, but it's a very divisive movie in general, which some would say is a sign of great art, but in any case it flopped.

Whatever the reason, this is very sad. Even if you hated The Northman this is not a good thing. For decades now we've seen reboot after remake after sequel after prequel after once-loved IP tarnished by the hacks that constitute working filmmakers at the moment. Meanwhile, Robert Eggers, a filmmaker who could not be loved more by fans and critics alike, has now all but officially had his big budget credentials revoked. 

Eggers himself has said he did not like working under the big studio model and is happy to return to smaller scale production, which I can understand, but I can't help but think that had The Northman been more successful at the box office then Eggers would have certainly been given far more freedom on any future major film he worked on. Something that would have been only a good thing for cinema but is no longer possible.

Decades ago Ridley Scott found a great solution to this situation. He'd make the film he wanted, let the studio release the cut they thought would sell the most tickets, and then he would release his Director's Cut. These films often were successful at the box office, and when the DC released the fans bought it in droves. Everybody wins, except for people like myself who want to see a brilliant film like the Kingdom of Heaven DC on the big screen, but I digress. According to Eggers there is no Director's Cut of The Northman. He essentially made his compromises with the studio along the way. It wasn't neutered in the editing. It was compromised during production. Maybe you can blame him for approaching it this way rather than Scott's way, but that's not really the point I'm trying to make here. 

We live in an age of content saturation, where the line between the big screen and the small screen has been blurred to such a degree that Villeneuve had to go head to head with execs to get Dune released in theaters rather than just streaming on HBO. Audiences have generally been conditioned to expect human characters to act like superheros lest they be viewed as ""boring,"" and people have been so overwhelmed by vibrant yet vapid CGI visuals that it's become both expected and also absolutely unimpressive. Robert Eggers is a fantastic director. Nobody serious really debates that, but due to the current Disney-dominated, post-Marvel landscape, and the monetary failure of The Northman, I think we may see studios take even less chances going forward. We may never get the next The Northman.",0,20,1662003089.0,2022-09-01 04:31:29,True
dune2,dune sequel,x2fa4b,David Lynch’s Dune is a great movie and aged very well.,"[(Included a link to some space wave music for a nice background while reading this post)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1J9LqFHhJmzNxgzcO18CLX)

No, this is not an attempt to bash Villeneuve’s Dune, which I consider obviously close to the source and I am a huge fan and of.

But the 1984 movie stands on its own merit and, while not as close to the source material as the latest film (among other things, Lynch once said he was not a fan of “kung fu in the desert”) but it conveys very well the elements of the universe of the book series sometimes even best than the 2021 film, and here are some examples [no spoilers]:

- It shows the point of view of the Emperor, with a magistral and alas underrated performance by the late Jose Ferrer: his machinations, his relationship to the other powers of the Imperium. Also, the throne room scene with the walls and pillars of gold emphasized how rich was the Corrino house, an important element in the book.

- It shows how powerful really the Guild was at the time, capable of forcing the hand of the Emperor and even threaten violence against his person. Also, the design of the Edric Navigator was flawless, straight out of the second book (because they weren’t really shown in Dune).

- The cenography was amazing and I personally prefer it to 2021 Dune. Certain details like eg. the decorated gate where the ships enter the Highliner.

It seems to me that, alongside the original additions of the movie (such as the weirding module, a cool idea by itself but which does not really adds much to the story despite being made a central plot device), Lynch included a lot of the elements of the Appendices of the original book and even some from the sequels (Edric as mentioned was one). That was great for word building purposes since much of the elements of the book are really hard to translate to the big screen and yet are necessary for immersion in the universe depicted in the story. Even Villeneuve understands this, hence the Salusa Secundus scene in his movie.

Plus, Dune 1984 has a pretty impressive soundtrack by Toto and Brian Eno (of course, the 2021’s soundtrack by Hans Zimmer was also fantastic).",2,18,1661956697.0,2022-08-31 15:38:17,True

# ""Leave the poor girl alone. You’re like a Pomeranian.""

I saw *Nope* yesterday, and I have to say that it was pretty good. Too bad it fell off the charts this week and probably won't return. However, it more than doubled its reported budget on a global scale as it went international just two weeks ago. Try catching this on the big screen, because that Hoytema cinematography is worth it.

*Maverick* continues to bring in a lot of cash. And although it doesn't show any signs of slowing down right now, I wonder if it still can bring in another 40mil to pass *Frozen II* on the [Global BO of all time](https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/worldwide/all-movies/cumulative/all-time). But I certainly won't be surprised if it did.

# Headlines of the week

Anyway, how are you? No, how are you *really?* You good? Yeah?

venom2,venom 2,1ioj005,Anyone else think one of the biggest issues with non-shared universe franchises is that they are very redundant?,"This is something I've been thinking about and noticed recently. Almost all of the franchise that aren't shared universe all seem to very derivative or repetitive.

Look at the Alien and Predator franchise, both have an expansive lore in their expanded universes in the comics, games, etc that go into the history of both the xenomorph and yautja, following individual members to specific points in time. Aliens has stories about how other races will fight and even harvest the xenos for their own use, we learn that they are actually very low on the food chain on their planet, see different subspecies of the xenos. For the Predator, we have tales of rebellion against a slave driving race that shaped their culture into hunter-warriors, we learn more about their honor code and daily lives, we have tales of redemption following individual hunters... And yet the movies are all the same stuff: Alien is just a bunch of halfwits being chased around a spaceship by an acid bug and the Predator movies are just mostly people running around the wilderness being chased by an alien.

Terminator is the same, Salvation tried to expand on the mythos by setting it DURING the human-skynet war, but that was walked for two derivative sequels. And let's not forget Jurassic Park. Dominion ended with dinosaurs in the modern world and it opened up a lot of potential new stories (2015's Backcountry with parasitic troodons, anybody?), but they literally kill off all the dinosaurs on a global scale JUST so we can have another movie about people going to a dinosaur island for the sixth time in this SEVEN movie franchise!

I know people were divided on Zack Snyder's Superman, but I actually like the original idea: a RE-construction of the character who has to EARN his status as the symbol of hope over the course of multiple films instead of just BEING one already. My favorite Superman story has a similar plot to this, and would love to have seen this come to full fruition... James Gunn's Superman looks to be doing the opposite, and just trying to also be in line with those prior Superman's, especially the Richard Donner movies, instead of something refreshingly different. I know that it's shaping up to be a tale about Superman's position s a symbol of hope in modern society being questioned, but that plot really does sound much better as a PART 3 than it does a PART 1.

Look at King Kong, ignoring the Monsterverse, half his filmography is literally retellings of the first movie: 1933, KKvG, Escapes, 1976, Mighty Kong, 2005, etc. Even most of the unmade movies are just rehashes or retellings, and the only continuity any cares about is just once again, a retelling that traps its worldbuilding within the rules of the 1932 public domain novelization. It wasn't until the Monsterverse came along and took notes from Godzilla of all characters, that King Kong actually became a character worth paying attention too; he now has a rogue's gallery that isn't just giant animals, he has allies, he has a consistently moving story over multiple movies, his mythos is being expanded in ways that is both interesting and fun, he's not just a big gorilla doomed to fall from grace (literally) again and again.

Speaking of which, I'm a Godzilla, and I can tell you strongest part of the franchise is it's wide variety of tones and storytelling; there is literally a Godzilla for everyone of every genre, and this is what allowed it last as long as it did. Same with Batman, though the live action adaptations look to be permanently sticking to Christopher Nolan's style, we still have films with the character being released with varying tones (Merry Little Batman was released two years after The Batman, and the former will be followed by Batman Ninja 2, two years later). Same with James Bond, the Ninja Turtles, and the plethora of public domain characters. If they were all portrayed the same again and again with a similar story, nobody would care because nothing new is being added or done. EVEN VENOM, though flawed, those movies do something different, something that wouldn't be possible if it was tied to the MCU.

And yet, for the most part, I only hear people say they want stuff to be like the original or whatnot; being The4thSnake constantly blustering about how NRS doesn't make new Mortal Kombat games the same way Midway did, the plethora of ""fans"" who want Godzilla Minus One to be the main inspiration going forward, people who want every single Marvel movie to be in the MCU and not just have Marvel movies separate and do their own thing, etc.

Am I crazy for not wanting everything to be derivative of prior works in their respective franchises, and would rather have every film or sequel be different?",0,17,1739453225.0,2025-02-13 13:27:05,False

venom2,venom 2,1i0w6jg,"January 10-12 Box Office Recap: 'Den of Thieves 2' takes the #1 spot from 'Mufasa' and 'Sonic', debuting with $15 million domestically. However, 'Better Man' massively flopped in its wide expansion, debuting at #13 with a terrible $1 million from 1,291 theaters, against its $110 million budget.","https://preview.redd.it/wyyfpflzhvce1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e6b820d9a6c3bcf91bab0d1448e8d898d5716f5

Turns out the kingdom didn't last long.

Whether it was a surprise or not, ***Den of Thieves 2: Pantera*** managed to dethrone ***Mufasa: The Lion King*** for the top spot at the box office. In some very bad news, the wide expansion of ***Better Man*** was a complete disaster, finishing outside the Top 10.

The Top 10 earned a combined $69.6 million this weekend. That's down 16.8% from last year, when ***Mean Girls*** and ***The Beekeeper*** opened. Despite the current LA fires, the LA market still accounted for 8% of the weekend's gross, which is actually above the usual 7.9% in a normal weekend.

Debuting at #1, ***Den of Thieves 2: Pantera*** earned $15 million in 3,008 theaters. That's almost on par with the original ***Den of Thieves*** ($15.2 million). It's also the first Lionsgate film to hit #1 at the box office since ***The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes*** in 2023 (they've had a very bad run last year).

Even though it arrived 7 years later, clearly the interest was there for a ***Den of Thieves*** sequel. Compared to a lot of recent actions flicks with Gerard Butler, it has maintained that popularity thanks to home media and streaming. But these films corner the exact same market: the dad movie market. There's an audience who simply wants to watch an old-school action movie, and ***Den of Thieves*** delivers that (just like ***The Beekeeper*** did one year ago). The LA fires also didn't do much impact in its box office numbers; the LA market generated 10.4% of the film's box office, which is actually bigger than the original's 9.3% LA share.

According to Lionsgate, 63% of the audience was male. As mentioned, this was a dad movie; 79% of the audience was 25 and over, with 52% over 35. They gave it a ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is the same grade as the original. January looks quite weak, although it will have to compete with stuff like ***Wolf Man*** and ***Flight Risk*** in a few weeks. Nevertheless, it has enough gas to hit $40 million domestically.

The reign of ***Mufasa*** lasted just one weekend, as it had to go back to the second spot. The film dropped 39.4%, adding $14.2 million this weekend. The film has earned $188.7 million, which is a colossal 61% behind the 2019 film through the same point.

In third place, ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** dropped 46.8%, adding $11.3 million. With this, it has not only passed the second film's gross, but it also passed the $200 million milestone. It has earned $204.8 million so far, and it should finish with around $240 million domestically.

In fourth place, Focus Features' ***Nosferatu*** dropped 47.3%, adding $6.8 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to a fantastic $81.8 million, and it's still on pace to finish with over $100 million, assuming it's not killed by ***Wolf Man*** this weekend.

***Moana 2*** fell back to Earth after its holiday boost. It dropped 47.5%, earning $6.5 million this weekend. The film has amassed $434.8 million domestically.

Searchlight's ***A Complete Unknown*** eased 37.4%, adding $5.1 million this weekend. With this, the film has crossed $50 million domestically, although the dream of $100 million died.

***Wicked*** had a slightly rough drop. This time, it fell 48.7%, grossing $5.1 million this weekend. Nevertheless, it's not like Universal ain't hurtin'; the film has made $70 million in PVOD in its first week. The film has earned a fantastic $458 million so far.

In eighth place, A24's ***Babygirl*** is still holding very well despite the end of the holidays. The film eased just 30.6% (the best drop in the top 10), adding $3 million this weekend. The film has earned a damn good $21.7 million so far.

In ninth place, the Indian film ***Game Changer*** earned $2 million from just 805 theaters.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Roadside Attractions' ***The Last Showgirl***, which finally had its wide release after having a limited weekend run at a single theater last month. It debuted with a solid $1.5 million in 870 theaters. While it's set to expand it in to a few more theaters, don't expect it to hit $10 million.

A24 expanded ***The Brutalist*** to 68 theaters, coming off its big wins at the Golden Globes last week. The film grossed a pretty great $1.3 million, which is a very strong $20,408 per-theater average. So far, the film has earned $2.7 million. It will see another expansion this weekend, before finally hitting wide release the following weekend.

***Gladiator II*** fell 53.4%, adding $1.2 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $170.9 million.

We have to go all the way to the #13 spot to find the weekend's other expansion, Paramount's ***Better Man***, the Robbie Williams biopic. We knew it was not gonna break out, given that its limited release numbers were very poor. Yet the film managed to surprise us by going even lower.

***Better Man*** debuted in 1,291 theaters, and the film earned a terrible $1 million. Yep, you read that correctly. That's an anemic $824 per-theater average. Assuming that each theater played this five times a day at a regular $11.90 ticket price, that means that there were just 4 people in each screening. Woah. And to make things worse, the film cost $110 million. Now, Paramount is not deeply invested in here; they only picked the distribution rights to the film for $25 million. They won't lose a lot of money, but this will be another money loss for them.

The American market was never going crazy for a Robbie Williams biopic for a simple reason: they have no idea who Robbie Williams is. That's quite surprising, given that he's the one of the best-selling singers in history (75 million records sold puts him in the same vein as The Weeknd, Green Day, Oasis, Nirvana and Imagine Dragons). But despite his popularity across Europe, Oceania and Latin America, Williams never broke out in America. Only two of his songs made it in the Billboard Top 100 (""Angels"" and ""Millennium"") and they both peaked at #53 and #72. So despite selling out a lot of concerts and records, he's still a complete unknown in America.

There's also the decision that was supposed to be its selling point, but still drew a polarizing reaction. To separate itself from other biopics, the film decided to depict Williams as a CGI chimpanzee. Bonus points for originality, but that also confused the general audience. So the audience are left with two questions ""who is Robbie Williams?"" and ""why is he a chimpanzee?"" Instead of trying to find more or listen to a few songs from Williams, they simply chose to not watch it all. After all, a music biopic is aimed at big fans of a singer, so why would they pay for an artist they don't care about? Even with great reviews (88% on RT and 77 on Metacritic), that's not enough to make them change their mind.

According to Paramount, 56% of the audience was male, and 52% was 25 and over. Despite some great word of mouth (83% on PostTrak, 63% definite recommend), this is not a film that will leg out. It's not gonna hit $5 million domestically, and it's likely it could miss $3 million as well. We want to say it will be saved overseas, but the film has been disappointing in the UK and Australia so far. This is a flop.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Mufasa: The Lion King*** topped the box office with $27.8 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $542 million. The film's best markets are France ($33.7M), UK ($29.9M), Mexico ($24.6M), Germany ($24M) and Italy ($21.8M).

***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** added $20.3 million, as it's nearing $400 million worldwide. Most notably, it opened in China, where it flopped with only a little over $1 million. The film's best markets are UK ($25.9M), Mexico ($18.8M), France ($15.8M), Australia ($13.2M) and Brazil ($9.2M).

***Nosferatu*** added $13.7 million, taking its worldwide total to a fantastic $135.4 million. It's Robert Egger's highest grossing film by a wide margin, passing ***The Northman*** a long time ago. The best markets are the UK ($11.1M), Mexico ($6.03M), Italy ($4.3M), Germany ($3.5M) and Australia ($3.4M).

***Moana*** added $11.1 million, helping it reach $990 million worldwide. The film's best markets are France ($60.6M), UK ($49.7M), Germany ($41.7M), Mexico ($30.2M) and Australia ($29.5M). It's hitting the billion milestone sometime this week.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Venom: The Last Dance* | Oct/25 | Sony | $51,012,404 | $139,755,882 | $474,775,261 | $120M
*Y2K* | Dec/6 | A24 | $2,113,923 | $3,763,863 | $3,763,863 | $15M

- Sony's ***Venom: The Last Dance*** has closed with $474 million worldwide. Despite its poor reception and word of mouth (""B–"" on CinemaScore), the film benefitted from a lack of competition, as studios chose to avoid releasing anything close to the election. A success? Definitely. But the film still ended up making less money than ***Let There Be Carnage***, which was released in worse conditions and had no China grosses. Who knows what's the future for this character.

- A24's ***Y2K*** has closed with a very poor $3.7 million in North America, which is a very bad 1.78x multiplier. Despite Kyle Mooney's interest in filmmaking, the film struggled to balance its horror and comedy elements, but at the end of the day, the audience simply wasn't interested. Let's hope his next film is much better, if he ever gets the chance.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We find two newcomers this weekend.

The first, and perhaps the weekend's winner, is Universal/Blumhouse's ***Wolf Man***. The film is the latest addition in Universal's reboot of their Classic Monsters line-up, after the success of ***The Invisible Man*** (also written and directed by Leigh Whannell). Horror is a very reliable genre, so perhaps we might be looking at another winner here.

The other wide release is Sony's ***One of Them Days***, which stars Keke Palmer and SZA as two friends who seek to avoid eviction. In the current landscape, there's been very few comedies not tied to IPS, so this can be a good test to see the interest in R-rated comedies.

#**ANNOUNCEMENT**

As this weekend falls on the MLK weekend, the actuals will probably be delayed by a day. So the post will go up on Tuesday.

venom2,venom 2,1ho6mzf,I saw 298 movies in theaters in 2024. Here is my full ranking.,"Every year I try to go to the movies as much as possible. It’s my main hobby. I keep track of my thoughts/scores throughout the year, along with all of my ticket stubs. In theaters, I saw: 5 movies in 2015, 9 movies in 2016, 146 movies in 2017, 162 movies in 2018, 192 movies in 2019, 44 movies in 2020, 86 movies in 2021, 270 movies in 2022, 325 movies in 2023, and 298 movies this year. This doesn’t include rewatches, but those are pretty rare for me (7 this year). This is my 7th year doing this ranking on /r/movies. 

I have a subscription with AMC’s A-List, Regal’s Unlimited, and Cinemark’s MovieClub. I’m also a member of the Fort Lauderdale, Miami, and Toronto film societies. 

I attended 8 film festivals this year, for a total of 117 films. I attended 24 World Premieres, 11 North American Premieres, 7 US Premieres, 10 East Coast Premieres, 22 Southeast Premieres, 4 Canadian Premieres, and a few Florida/Georgia Premieres. 

96 of my screenings had cast and/or crew present for Q&As/intros. 

I do these rankings and reviews/random thoughts for fun. It’s not meant to be taken super seriously. I just like movies, and I like ranking them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Red Rooms** - 10/10 - The most gripping psychological-thriller since *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*.  Extremely disturbing and unsettling at times, but also stylish and sleek. The courtroom scenes and vampire-movie-like score stick with you for a long time. Juliette Gariépy puts in the best performance of anyone this year. There's so much amazing stuff happening with French-Canadian cinema recently and this is another great addition. Best movie of the year. One of the best movies of the past decade.

**Dune: Part Two** - 9/10 - Sci-fi doesn't get much better than this. I have the seemingly-unpopular opinion that the first movie is better than the second, but both are near-perfect. Everything that can be said about Dune 1/2 has pretty much already been said. 

**Anora** - 9/10

**Civil War** - 9/10

**Nosferatu** - 9/10 - Gothic horror is so back. Lily-Rose Depp does things in this movie physically that I've never seen before on the big screen. Extremely impressed with her performance (and with Hoult/Dafoe/Skarsgard/Corrin as well). A great ensemble surrounded with perfect set design, direction, and cinematography. Loved the scenes in the castle that almost appeared black-and-white. Robert Eggers has not missed for me so far, and this is my favorite of his.

**Challengers** - 9/10

**Sing Sing** - 9/10 - Colman Domingo, give that man his Oscar [John Malkovich Rounders voice].

**The Substance** - 9/10

**You Are Not Alone** - 9/10 -	Part La La Land, part Under the Skin, part Eternal Sunshine. A beautiful and hypnotic sci fi love story with a slight horror edge and with layers upon layers of metaphor.  It has a lot of interesting things to say about mid-20s loneliness/thoughts of suicide/love/etc.

**Didi** - 9/10 -  I'm a sucker for coming-of-age dramas set in recent times. Give me more of this and mid90s-type movies pls.

**The Order** - 8/10

**We Live In Time**	- 8/10 - I went in expecting heartbreak (which I got), but I didn’t expect how funny/sharp it would be. Florence and Andrew have 10/10 chemistry. Only thing keeping it from a higher score is the goofy Super Bowl of Food or whatever scene near the end. The scene at the beginning in the parking garage might be one of the most heart wrenching and well-acted scenes of the entire year. Top-tier score as well.

**Love Lies Bleeding** - 8/10 - I would watch a 2-hour movie montage of Katy O'Brian working out beneath a highway underpass. A violent & twisted mess of sweat/blood/sex/tears/ungodly bodily noises. A real wicked fun time.

**The Goldman Case** - 8/10 - French courtroom dramas, so hot right now. An insanely smart and water-tight screenplay with engrossing performances. It reminded me a lot of Anatomy of a Fall then I realized the co-star (Arthur Harari) in this film is the co-writer of Anatomy.

**The Beast** - 8/10 - A movie that's almost impossible to describe but I'll try: Dystopian-future-sci-fi, period-drama, modern-incel-breakin-thriller, all while staying completely original and beautiful. Extremely layered story and performances. Lea Seydoux and George MacKay are 2 of my favorite actors and they pulled this off with extreme precision and care. One of more harrowing final scenes of the year for sure. 

**Conclave** - 8/10

**Saturday Night** - 8/10 - Frenetic, engaging, and a really fun time. Flies by. I wanted more. So much energy.

**September 5** - 8/10

**The Brutalist** - 8/10 - I have some problems with the ending, feels like it undid a lot of what was experienced, but otherwise an impressive monster of a movie. Brody and Pearce are outstanding.

**Io Capitano** - 8/10

**Fremont** - 8/10 - I love movies that flow like light poems, like Petite Maman or Journey to A Mother's Room. It was a very sweet and cozy. The psychiatry sessions in particular were hilarious, and the bit where the diners are reading their fortunes in the restaurants were perfect. One of my favorite lines of the year is when the old lady fortune cookie writer dies at her desk, and the boss says “she was getting too old to write about the future anyway”. The lead and Jeremy Allen White were only onscreen together but their chemistry was infectious

**Seagrass** - 8/10

**LaRoy, Texas** - 8/10 - A hilariously-dark Coen Brothers throwback with wonderful performances from Steve Zahn and John Magaro (who I was lucky enough to meet prior to the screening). It's bloody and smart, and that's a rare combination.

**A Quiet Place: Day One** - 8/10

**The Last Showgirl** - 8/10 - Apart from a few awkward line-deliveries and questionable dialogue in spots, this was a very lowkey, engaging drama with a career-best performances from Pamela Anderson and Dave Bautista. Very dreamy and light.

**Friendship**	- 8/10 - It's so fucking stupid. Absolutely no plot to speak of. There's no character development. It's barely even a movie. It's basically a 90-minute sketch. All that being said, it's so goddamn hilarious. Non-stop laughs. Most I've laughed since Red Rocket probably. It's a can't-miss for any Tim Robinson fan and a can't-miss for any fans of laughing. Kate Mara was the perfect foil character. 

**The Wild Robot** - 8/10 - Yes, I cried, what of it?

**Relay** - 8/10 - A very solid, tight, throwback to the type of paranoid corporate-thrillers they don’t really make anymore. A super fun twist that I didn’t see coming at all, and a standout turn from Lily James. It slightly loses its way near the end.

**Good One** - 8/10 - Familiar and lowkey, but with a dark edge that slowly reveals itself, and a superb breakout role from Lily Collias. Great debut film from director India Donaldson.

**A Complete Unknown**	- 8/10 - There's definitely a lack of plot but at the end of the day we all just want to see Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits performed by a generational talent in Timothee Chalamet and it definitely delivers in that aspect.

**Midwives** - 8/10 - One of the more stressful movies I’ve seen in a while. My anxiety was through the roof, especially in the first half. It’s so realistic and graphic at times (and some of it *has* to be real, some birth scenes especially) that you almost get a sense that it’s a documentary. Totally nails the landing too, making you feel real anger/empathy about how Midwives are treated in France (and other places I assume).

**Hellbent On Boogie** - 8/10	

**Alien: Romulus** - 8/10 - Put Cailee Spaeny in anything and I'll watch it.

**Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga** - 8/10	

**The Old Oak** - 8/10 - British realism cinema at it's finest. Just another classic added to Ken Loach's resume.

**Longlegs** - 8/10	

**Babygirl** - 8/10	

**One Life** - 8/10 - I'm not a huge movie-cryer but I was absolutely balling my eyes out near the ""moment"". You know it's coming and it's still hit. Impressive when a movie can do that. Last movie that hit me like that was probably Tori and Lokita, and before that Moonlight. This was up there in terms of tears. Did not really expect it going in. Devasting. Anthony Hopkins kills these types of roles, he has a way of showing bottled up regret/sadness that not many others can.

**The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare** - 8/10 - Over-the-top violent fun time. Totally ridiculous but it doesn't take itself seriously and that's what keeps it from veering into. Also, Eiza Gonzalez. That is all.

**Strange Darling** - 8/10

**Los Frikis** - 8/10	

**Suncoast** - 8/10	

**Drive-Away Dolls** - 8/10 - I want more unapologetically horny movies like this. Loved all of Beanie Feldstein's bits and the slow, sleep-deprived descent into madness of the henchmen especially. Not too sure abou the weird-cheap transitions and trippy scenes though.  ""You're a day late and a penis short"" and ""Suki that's your wall dildo!"" are two of the funniest lines of the year, within context. Give me more fast-paced 75-minute movies.

**In A Violent Nature** - 8/10 -This made me feel physically nauseous several times, would strongly recommend. Some of the gnarliest kills I've ever seen on the big screen. 

**A Real Pain** - 8/10

**Abigail**- 8/10 - As a French-Canadian, big shoutout to Kevin Durand for his on-point Quebecois accent. Also, ""Sammy, those are fucking onions"" was one of the best/funniest line deliveries of the year. Really entertaining gory vampire flick. Dan Stevens is straight up having a fun time this year and I'm enjoying it every time. Melissa Barrera is now competing with with Mia Goth and Samara Weaving as top Scream Queens.

**Deadpool & Wolverine** - 8/10

**Bring Them Down** - 8/10 - I love me a slow-burn family feud drama that slowly snowballs into something dark and sinister. Christopher Abbott is one of my favorite working actors today and he does incredible work here, especially with the accent/Irish/body language. Disclaimer: Not recommended to people sensitive to animal violence/cruelty. There's a lot of that.

**The Piano Lesson** - 8/10 - As far as Denzel Washington-produced, August Wilson adaptations are concerned, this is way above *Fences*. Felt less like a straight-up filmed play. The supernatural element and amazing Danielle Deadwyler performance (give her an Oscar soon pls) make this more layered and interesting. Bonus: I was sitting with/near the cast/crew for this one, 5-10 feet away from Denzel/Danielle/John David/Malcolm/Corey Hawkins/Ray Fisher/Michael Potts. Amazing experience.

**Nickel Boys** - 8/10

**Fresh Kills** - 8/10 - A really solid mob-drama told from the perspective of a mob boss' daughter, which I appreciated. It's rare you see this story from that angle. Emily Bader's scene with her dad near the end. Holy. Fucking. Shit.

**Between The Temples** - 8/10 - Carol Kane was absolutely magnetic and a joy to watch in this, and Jason Schwartzman was her perfect endearing counter. Lovely movie, that makes you want to curl up into a ball and cringe to death near to end, in a good way. The most painful-to-watch family reunion/dinner since Shiva Baby. 

**Problemista** - 8/10 - I stand with Bank of America. Julio Torres is kind of a revelation in this. His facial expressions (and hilarious run-walk thing) are perfect. Absurd, funny, and sweet comedy with so much flair and uniqueness. Some fun little details that got good laughs out of me, like Tilda's character always having her phone light on. Chaotic in all of the right ways.

**Sisterhood**	- 8/10

**Days of Happiness** - 8/10

**The Apprentice** - 8/10 - It's not breaking any new ground but Sebastian Stan is a pleasure to watch transform into Trump as the movie goes on. Grimy and gross like the streets of New York in the 80s.

**Wil** - 8/10

**Naked Ambition: Bunny Yeager** - 8/10

**Soul** - 8/10 - I didn't get to catch this during it's original run due to COVID so I'm glad it came back. My favorite Pixar movie in a little while.

**Femme** - 8/10	

**I Saw the TV Glow** - 8/10 

**Heretic** - 7/10 - A fun horror with sharp dialogue and an incredibly-hammy Hugh Grant performance.

**Emilia Perez** - 7/10 - Some amazing musical numbers, especially the opener and ""El Mal"", and Zoe Saldana has an amazing performance where she carries the entire thing (Gomez and Gascon are getting lots of praise but I didn’t see it), but it just felt like it never fully came together to reach full potential.

**Mountains** - 7/10 - A very small and warm movie about the very big and cold issue of gentrification and the real estate crisis in South Florida. Monica Sorelle is a director to watch for sure.

**Skywalkers: A Love Story** - 7/10	- Other than a few moments that seemed a bit scripted (mostly the relationship drama), this is the most thriller documentary since Free Solo.

**Ghostlight** - 7/10	

**Shoshana** - 7/10 - Israeli true-life spy-thriller, a bit Bond-like. There's a few kills in here that are insanely brutal and the explosions/gunshots catch you by surprise. It had me jump a few times.

**The Dead Don't Hurt** - 7/10- Extremely slow, don't go in expecting an action-packed Western, but Viggo has a really good eye for beautiful backgrounds and settings. Vicky Krieps is top-tier as always. This movie doesn't work without her. I like slow Westerns.

**The Fall Guy** - 7/10	

**Thelma** - 7/10	

**Twisters** - 7/10 -Natural disaster flicks just work for me. Getting to look at Daisy Edgar-Jones for 2 hours never hurts as well.

**Cuckoo** - 7/10 - Insanely impressive and physical performance from Hunter Schafer. Cool visual style and flair, but ultimately dragged down by a total clusterfuck of a plot. I was confused throughout. Hilarious German accent from Dan Stevens

**Peak Season** - 7/10	

**Kneecap** - 7/10 - Some of the funniest one-liners of the year (""Look who it is, Bone Thugz and no harmony"", ""I feel like I discovered the Beatles, if the Beatles were shit.""). The whole RRAD storyline kept it from greatness though, that was a bit too goofy for its own good.

**Wolfs** - 7/10 - I went in wanting Pitt/Clooney banter and that's exactly what I got.

**Blink Twice** - 7/10	

**My Old Ass** - 7/10	

**Better Man** - 7/10	

**Nightbitch**	- 7/10 - Your mom's favorite movie of 2024. The awful first trailer didn't do it justice, this was solid, it just doesn't get dark like you'd hope it would.

**Out of Darkness**	- 7/10 - Saw this during a Mystery Movie Monday and was pleasantly surprised. Pretty brutal, atmospheric, and violent. Some cool overhead shots and a nice score. One of the better Mystery Movies I've seen.

**We Grown Now** - 7/10	

**The End We Start From** - 7/10	

**Kinds of Kindness** - 7/10 - Not the best Yorgos but deliciously-freaky and daring filmmaking nonetheless.

**Babes** - 7/10

**Fancy Dance** - 7/10	

**MaXXXine** - 7/10 - Definitely the weakest of the trilogy but still a solid slasher with a very interesting setting. Mia Goth has great moments like in the first two.

**Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1** - 7/10 - I don't care, the montage at the end was sick. I really hope Costner gets to fund as many of these as he wants.

**Wicked - 7/10** - Pretty good, not great. Ariana Grande was the standout. There were only 2 songs that were really catchy though, wish there were more.

**Juror #2** - 7/10

**Fly Me to the Moon** - 7/10	

**The End** - 7/10 - Gorgeously-shot, super well acted, beautiful set design and production, but way too long and had no reason to be a musical. The songs were all exactly the same and pointless and there much so much time in between that you would forget it was even a musical. George MacKay kills it.

**Being Maria** - 7/10	

**Cabrini** - 7/10 - Maybe a bit overlong but honestly not bad. Surprised it's from the same director as Sound of Freedom, it's quite a step up from that. Much larger and ambitious in scope, and the lead actress was really really great. It solidly panders to its intended audience but it’s well made enough that you can just gloss over the eye-rolling moments.

**In the Land of Saints and Sinners** - 7/10 - The best Neeson action-flick in a while, so that's something. Kerry Condon as the big villain was awesome. Need more of her in stuff.

**Y2K** - 7/10 - The single-funniest death scene of the year was the skateboard scene. Laughed so hard, made my night. Audience really dug this one too, good atmosphere. Fred Durst.

**The Queen of My Dreams** - 7/10 - I was getting massive Deja Vu with The Persian Version last year. Extremely similar story and vibe, equally fun/honest/heartfelt.

**Speak No Evil** - 7/10	

**Immaculate** - 7/10 - Sydney Sweeney stepping out of her comfort zone and doing a nun-horror is cool. Long take near the end was sick.

**Gladiator II** - 7/10 - Doesn't hold a candle to the original but it was still an entertaining sandals & swords story. Fred Hechinger is so awful in this though. Man, that took me out of it. 

**Back to Black** - 7/10 - This movie is conflicting. In a vacuum, ignoring Winehouse's actual story, it's a solid music-biopic carried by a powerhouse breakthrough performance from Marisa Abela and an amazing soundtrack (obviously). On the other hand, it's a disgusting whitewash by her estate to downplay her truly awful father. The fact that he had final approval over this movie, and will financially benefit from it, is just gross and hard to ignore. The 2015 documentary does a better job telling Amy's whole story in an emotional way, and that doc made my blood boil (and is one of my favorite docs ever). 

**Coup!** - 7/10	

**The Hypnosis** - 7/10	

**The Last Stop in Yuma County** - 7/10	

**Your Monster** - 7/10

**Blitz** - 7/10 - The cartoonish villains and improbably scenarios the kid kept finding himself in took this down a notch for me. Could've been great, but it didn't quite get there. How much bad shit can happen to one kid in 24 hours? Find out with Blitz. On a technical level it had a lot going for it though.

**In the Summers** - 7/10	

**Maria** - 7/10 - Jolie kills it and it looked gorgeous but a really big step down from Jackie/Spencer for Pablo Larrain, a big 'style over substance' movie and weirdly disrespectful to Jackie Kennedy as well for some odd reason. Very weird structure.

**Lost Soulz** - 7/10

**The Girls Are Alright** - 7/10

**All We Imagine As Light** - 7/10 - With all the hype I was expecting to be blown away. It was good but kind of a let down.

**Girls Will Be Girls** - 7/10	

**Ezra** - 7/10

**Young Woman and the Sea** - 7/10 - An inspiring sports-biopic with a very old-school and authentic feel. The Remember the Titans of swimming movies. It hits all of the cliches and it's super cheesy, but in all of the right ways. It just works. Daisy Ridley was great, and as far as swimming movies are concerned, it's definitely ahead of Nyad.

**Hundreds of Beavers** - 7/10 - It's funny and original, I just wish it was a bit shorter. Some of the bits definitely outstay their welcome after a while. I really like the grassroots campaign they've built around this movie though, everything from the independent theatrical showings to the support of physical media. A great success story for indie film this year.

**The Idea of You** - 7/10	

**Crossing** - 7/10

**Sleep** - 7/10	

**Monkey Man** - 7/10 - Solid action flick for the first and third acts, but dragged down by a super boring 2nd act (where it loses all of the momentum it built) and lots of sloppy/confusing editing, especially during chase sequences. Credit for the Terrence Malick-like flashback scenes with narration/sweeping music/shots of nature/etc, pretty cool to throw those into an action movie.

**The Color Purple** - 7/10	

**The Damned** - 7/10 - You're hanging out with the soldiers on the frontier of the American Civil War and almost nothing happens for the entire runtime except you learn about the characters and their thoughts on life/god/religion/etc. I enjoyed it.

**Mean Girls**	- 7/10	

**Driving Madelaine** - 7/10	

**Late Night with the Devil** - 7/10
	
**Snack Shack** - 7/10 - Aside from the needless death at the end that tries too hard to squeeze tears out of your eyeballs, I thought this was a fun, raunchy, summer-y throwback comedy. This would've been one of my favorites in middle school probably.

**Beetlejuice Beetlejuice** - 7/10	

**Joker: Folie a Deux** - 7/10	

**The Outrun** - 7/10 - Less a compelling story and more a showcase on Saoirse Ronan's acting abilities. The camera basically doesn't move from her for a single second and she completely carries it. She's the best.

**Flow** - 7/10

**Black Box Diaries** - 7/10	

**Queer** - 7/10

**The Return** - 7/10	

**New Life** - 7/10	- I really respect a movie that can pull off a wild genre-switch halfway through the movie. Went in fully blind so it was totally unexpected. Also impressive this tiny movie could license Bob Dylan’s Like A Rolling Stone (played a few times).

**Lisa Frankenstein** - 7/10  - The ultimate ""could've been truly great with a R rating"" movie.

**Bob Marley: One Love** - 7/10 - It does just enough to keep it out of the Super Generic Biopic Genre and any movie that can squeeze a few tears out of me gets an extra point. Sorry, that's just the rules.

**Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes** - 7/10	

**1992**- 7/10 - Other than Ray Liotta being written like a ridiculous cartoon villain and some eye-rolling dialogue issues, it actually was a pretty solid crime drama... and Tyrese Gibson was…good? (/r/brandnewsentence)

**French Girl** - 7/10	

**The Peasants** - 7/10 - Visually impressive and a sick score, but a schmaltzy/melodramatic story kinda kept it from the next level.

**The Monk and the Gun** - 7/10	

**Bad Boys: Ride or Die**	- 6/10	

**Seven Blessings**	- 6/10

**Knox Goes Away** - 6/10 - Michael Keaton does his best and commits but the writing & performance of every single side character brings the whole thing down a bit. The cop/ex-wife/son characters are bumbling, distractingly-dumb goofballs that keep the plot from ever grounding to reality, but it ultimately gets dark and violent enough to stay pretty entertaining. The script really could've used some more cleaning up.

**Trap** - 6/10 - Listen I have a lot (*a lot*) of problems with this movie but Kid Cudi randomly showing up for 5 minutes and randomly delivering insane lines like ""“I specifically said i wanted honey suckle kombucha biiiiitchhhh” made the trip to the theater worth it.

**Small Things Like These** - 6/10	

**Sometimes I Think About Dying** - 6/10	

**Kidnapped**	- 6/10	

**Asphalt City** - 6/10 - Standout performance from Tye Sheridan but this leaned a bit too much into misery porn for my liking. Every single day is the absolute worst day on the job. Extremely stress-inducing first hour. Mike Tyson being cast as the medic chief was certainly a choice...and it worked somehow?

**Eden**	- 6/10 - Had trouble getting past the awful accents and the sinking feeling that this was missed potential. I was at the World Premiere for this and someone in the audience had a medical emergency, they had to pause the screening and turn the lights on while the person was carried out on people's shoulders. Jude Law/Sydney Sweeney/Ana de Armas/Ron Howard were all there wondering what was going on. Kind of a crazy situation.

**Land of Bad** - 6/10	

**Unstoppable** - 6/10	

**Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire** - 6/10 - Skull Island's bland and less impressive/memorable little brother. Thumbs up for Baby Kong and the Rio de Janeiro destruction sequence, thumbs down for the lame story and unlimited amounts of annoying human characters.

**Bad Shabbos** - 6/10	

**Inside Out 2** - 6/10	

**Firebrand** - 6/10	

**A Different Man** - 6/10 - I didn't connect to this as much as most people did. Sebastian Stan is great as usual but the whole thing didn't do much for me.

**Love Me** - 6/10 - 10/10 for the attempt, 4/10 for the execution. There's a really good movie hidden in here somewhere, but there needed to be some cuts made to the animated portions of the film for sure.

**Shell**	- 6/10

**Housekeeping for Beginners** - 6/10	

**Totem** - 6/10

**The Fire Inside** - 6/10	

**Widow Clicquot**	- 6/10 - This starts off really really really slow but then finds its footing late and ends on a solid note. Career-best performance from Haley Bennett, she really carries this.

**Tuesday** - 6/10	

**Piece by Piece** - 6/10	

**The Cut** - 6/10 - Standout turns from Orlando Bloom and Caitriona Balfe, brought down by some weird editing choices. The neon-green hallucinations were a wild choice. I sat next to Katy Perry for this movie, AMA.

**Memoir of a Snail** - 6/10

**The Romano Twins** - 6/10	

**Mufasa: The Lion King** - 6/10
	
**Film Geek** - 6/10	

**Self-Reliance** - 6/10 - Pretty cute movie with a few laughs, but the ending lost its focus and felt rushed. The Andy Samberg bits were great. I wanted more from the relationship with Anna Kendrick's character, feels like there was more to explore there. ""This an intervention."" ""For me?"" ""No, we're just all facing the wrong direction.""

**Queen of the Ring** - 6/10	

**Coup de Chance**	- 6/10 - It's nowhere near peak-Woody Allen but it's a passable return to form since Rifkin's Festival, Wonder Wheel, and A Rainy Day In New York (all 3 awful, with Rifkin's Festival being rock bottom for Allen's filmography). The one thing it was missing was humor. I can always trust an Allen film to at least have a few funny/witty lines (even the bad ones), but this was very cut and dry. Could've used a few more good lines.

**Sasquatch Sunset** - 6/10 - I was excited for the premise and there's a few sweet/funny moments, but most of it ends up being mindless shitting/pissing/fucking. Credit for the unique idea and great views.

**Bird**	- 6/10 - One of the more disappointing films of the year. Even after the lukewarm reception at Cannes, I had super high hopes because I’m a huge Andrea Arnold fan, but the surrealism in this movie just didn’t work. It threw off the whole balance and wasn’t at all what I expected/wanted. Nikiya Adams and Barry Keoghan were both very solid, and the scene where the group sang Coldplay’s Yellow to the frog was amazing.

**Omni Loop**- 6/10	

**Here**	- 6/10 - A valiant attempt but ultimately kind of a hot mess. A few good moments keep it watchable. Some real uncanny valley shit in there too though.

**Queen Rock Montreal** - 6/10	

**Turning Red** - 6/10	

**Scrambled** - 6/10	

**The Book of Clarence** -  6/10 - LaKeith Stanfield was great and committed as usual (although I don't like twin dual-roles), and James McAvoy and Cumberbatch chewing on scenery was fun, this movie had a lot of trouble figuring out what it wanted to be. I really wish it leaned more into the funny/satire and less into the serious Mel Gibson/Jim Caviezel-type biblical drama. Cool that a movie like this can be made/funded and released in theaters though.

**Booger** - 6/10	

**Irena's Vow** - 6/10 - Great story, extremely generic period drama.

**A Great Divide** - 6/10	

**Riff Raff** - 6/10 - A bit outdated and mean-spirited, this would've slapped in 2006, but Bill Murray and Pete Davidson as the incompetent mob assassins makes it worth a watch. 

**Rosalie** - 6/10

**Skincare** - 6/10	

**Yellow Bus** - 6/10
	
**Arcadian** - 6/10 - It's fine and stretches its tiny budget so its absolute limit but it's basically a Dollar Store A Quiet Place. The monster design and animation was hilariously-bad though, like an Asylum knock-off movie. I'm also now convinced that Nic Cage is contractually obligated to have his face smothered in fake blood for any movie.

**Nutcrackers** - 6/10 

**The Invisibles** - 6/10
	
**Riley** -6/10	

**Rob Peace**	- 6/10 - A well-shot movie with great direction and performance from the supporting characters (Mary J Blige and Chiwetel Ejiofor) completely dragged down by an awful lead performance by Jay Will. Also the script was a bit silly, they were trying way too hard to make him 100% infallible.

**Christmas Eve in Miller's Point** - 6/10 - I liked the hectic atmosphere of the crazy Christmas family party that we've all been at, and the very scratchy look of the camera.

**Rumours** - 6/10 - I can appreciate what Maddin was going for, and there's some moments that work (mostly with Cate Blanchett and Charles Dance, they were awesome), but overall surreal-absurd-fantasy-comedy like this just doesn't work for me.

**Fallen Fruit** - 6/10	

**Birthrite** - 6/10	

**Crumb Catcher** - 6/10	

**Anselm** - 6/10	

**Scapegoat** - 6/10	

**Seeds** - 5/10 - There’s clearly heart and maybe a great movie in here somewhere, but it’s such a tonal mess that it’s hard to find anything to love.

**Sujo** - 5/10	

**The Beekeeper** - 5/10 - This is the Rebel Moon of Jason Bourne movies. A few cool kills and classic Statham one-liners keep it from being a total loss, but it's not very good.

**Unsung Hero** - 5/10

**Jeanne du Barry**- 5/10	

**Treasure** - 5/10

**A Sacrifice** - 5/10	

**The American Society of Magical Negroes** - 5/10 - All over the place and it gave a constant feeling of ""missed opportunity"" (a la Book of Clarence). Justice Smith is straight-up not a convincing lead. An-Li Bogan was the standout, and I saw her end twist coming from a mile away so I got that going for me which is nice.

**La Syndicaliste** - 5/10

**Sonic the Hedgehog 3** - 5/10	

**The Watchers** - 5/10

**Borderlands** - 5/10 - Went in expecting a 1/10, got a 5/10. Nice. Life is all about the little wins.

**Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire** - 5/10 - Just give this franchise a permanent rest. It wasn't awful in any particular way, but it was totally soulless and heartless. It felt like nobody really gave a shit except Kumail Nanjiani. Safe, sanitized, studio slop. They couldn't even fully commit to the one interesting thing (the gay ghost love story).

**National Anthem** - 5/10	

**The 4:30 Movie**	- 5/10 - Kevin Smith jerking himself off for 80 minutes. Would make a fun double-feature with *Snack Shack* though.

**Universal Language** - 5/10 - This had a lot of hype of out Cannes and it's Canada's submission for the Oscars so I had a lot of hope, but it just didn't do much for me. Surreal-absurdism just isn't my cup of tea. The only real standout scene was the one with the Quebec democrat. A rare case of the Q&A being more interesting than the movie itself.

**Kraven the Hunter** - 5/10	

**Time Still Turns the Pages** - 5/10	

**Upgraded** - 5/10	- Basically a Great Value The Devil Wears Prada. Good as rom-com-background-nois. Marissa Tomei is awful in this. One of the worst performances of the year.

**Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot** - 5/10	

**Out of Season** - 5/10	

**Miller's Girl** - 5/10	

**Latin for All** - 5/10	

**Argylle** - 5/10 - How a movie like The Creator can be made for $80M but something so awful-looking like this needs $200M blows my mind. 

**I.S.S.** - 5/10 - I love a good sandwich-making climax as much as the next guy, but what a painfully awkward ending. The first 25 minutes made me think something decent could be happening then it derails hard and never recovers. The worst thing to happen to the space program since Challenger.

**Get Away** - 5/10	

**Brothers** - 5/10	

**Life's a Bitch** - 5/10 - France's (bad) answer to Yorgos Lanthimos. A dry, twisted, gross, weirdly-sexual, anthology film with a lot less nudity but a lot more dogs than Kinds of Kindness. Kinda loses its way comedically and becomes a chore after the first chapter.

**Azrael** - 5/10	

**Monster Summer** - 5/10 - Like a G-rated IT, with Mel Gibson for some reason (?)

**Kung Fu Panda 4** - 5/10	

**Garfield** - 5/10

V**illains, Inc** - 5/10 - It had a certain cheap charm but an overwhelming sense of ""SNL Digital Short sketch stretched way too thin"".

**Excursion** - 5/10	

**Sleeping Dogs** -  5/10

**Notice to Quit** - 5/10 - The kid actor was really good but I'm just a bit over following an extremely unlikeable lead around doing shitty things to people.

**Reunion** - 5/10

**The Boy in the Woods**	- 5/10	

**Paradise** - 5/10	

**Karaoke** - 5/10	

**It Ends With Us**	- 5/10	

**Poolman** - 4/10 - The ugly, boring,  confused lovechild of Inherent Vice and Under the Silver Lake.

**Avenue of the Giants** - 4/10	

**Arthur the King** - 4/10 - Marky Mark has really devolved as an actor honestly, really tough performance from him here. It's like he's completely forgotten how to convincingly deliver lines. Right from the GoPro scenes at the beginning I knew it was gonna be a rough time. This movie is like 85% exposition.

**Janet Planet** - 4/10 - Bookended by 2 great scenes, but filled with mostly pointless garbage.

**Dandelion**	- 4/10	

**By the Stream** - 4/10	- I enjoy Hong Sangsoo movies in very small doses. This dose was just way too big.

**Venom: The Last Dance** - 4/10	

**Red One** - 4/10	

**Oh, Canada** - 4/10 - Dreadfully confusing, and Jacob Elordi puts in one of the worst performances of the year, but at least that Phosphorescent soundtrack kept me engaged. 

**Slingshot** - 4/10	

**Adios Buenos Aires** - 4/10	

**Humane** - 4/10	

**Some Other Woman** - 4/10	

**My Daughter, My Love** - 4/10	

**Madame Web** - 4/10 - Slop.

**IF** - 4/10 - Not really for adults, not really for kids/teens. Who was this movie even for?...

**Freud's Last Session** - 4/10	

**Werewolves** - 4/10 - So much lens flare. I am now blind.

**Ramona at Midlife** - 4/10	

**The Last Front** - 4/10	

**My Penguin Friend** - 4/10
	
**Augure** - 4/10	

**Which Brings Me To You** - 4/10 - Looking back over this ranking, I'm gonna be honest and say I have no idea what this was. Don't remember. To producers out there: please stop making your movie titles random vague sentences.

**Mai** - 4/10	

**Meanwhile on Earth** - 4/10	

**Lizzie Lazarus** - 4/10	

**Or Something** - 4/10	

**The Way We Speak** - 4/10	

**Cult Killer** - 3/10 - Antonio Banderas shows up for like 5 minutes and then nopes the fuck out. Total paycheck movie.

**The Feeling that the Time for Doing Something Has Passed** - 3/10 - There were some funny lines (especially the 9/11 dating profile bit) but this was so painfully dry and slow that I could never really connect. If desert-dry, awkward, deadpan delivery, with an absurd amount of BDSM-sex-stuff thrown in is your thing, you might find a few things to like. I could not.

**Never Let Go** - 3/10	

**The Throwback** - 3/10	

**The City** - 3/10	

**Rats!**	- 3/10 - This would've worked well as an edgy Youtube short in 2012.

**The Best Christmas Pageant Ever** - 3/10	

**He Went That Way** - 3/10 - Half roadtrip comedy with a chimp, half brutal serial killer drama. Tonally all over the place. The kind of movie you'd expect Jacob Elordi to try to bury (a la Dicaprio with Don's Plum) and fire his agent over before it sees the light of way. Baffling decisions made by everyone here. 

**Megalopolis** - 2/10 - I went in expecting a mess but I was still not prepared for how bad this was. It’s Neil Breen with an unlimited budget. It felt like 6 hours. It looked so cheap and awful. A mix of Lifetime movie and a middle school play. I refuse to believe it’s bad on purpose for comedy. The only thing keeping this from a 1 is that Adam Driver/Coppola/Nathalie Emmanuel/Giancarlo Esposito were at my screening for Q&A (god bless their sweet little souls for having to seriously promote this hot mess). ""What do you think of this boner I got right here?” is a line 85 year old Jon Voight actually says in a real movie in the year of our lord 2024. My therapist will hear about this.

**A Boy Who Dreamt of Electricity** - 2/10	

**Isle of Hope** - 2/10 - Sometimes I wonder why I do this to myself.

**Chosen Family** - 1/10	- This was borderline unfinished and full-on embarrassing. The production value of a daytime soap opera mixed in with the sound editing of a local high school play. It's impressive how much filler (drone shots of surrounding neighborhood) can be squeezed into 84 minutes of movie. Sitting a few seats away from Heather Graham was a nice bonus (with Q&A), but it couldn't come close to making up for this disaster.

[2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18s4re1/we_went_to_the_movies_55_times_this_year_and_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  \-  [2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/zgw1vo/we_went_to_the_movies_39_times_this_year_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

This is now my third year doing something like this, and I really enjoyed talking to people last year about where my movies fell versus where they felt things needed to land. There were definitely a few criticisms last year that I'd like to clear up beforehand:

* I do view myself as a ""typical moviegoer"" and don't see myself as a cinephile at all.
* My wife and I tend to go during the weekends at daytime hours, it's just our preference, which does limit us sometimes with movies that aren't as popular and are in their 3rd-4th week of a run.
* There are a lot of movies we'd like to see but don't get around to just because a smaller release happens during a time where we're very busy and don't get to the theater for a few weeks.
* Many of you were critical of the fact that I often took small naps during movies - It never bothered me, but I did find out that I was vitamin D deficient early this year, and taking vitamins has helped out a lot
* This list does include movies from 2023 that I either saw at the beginning of 2024, or we saw in 2023 after releasing my list last year.

**A Quick Note on Categories:**

Other than ""Favorite of the Year"" I don't particularly have other categories ranked top to bottom in terms of favorite. There are movies in the ""Enjoyed it, but Probably Wouldn't Watch Again"" category that I liked better than movies in the ""Enjoyed it and Would Watch Again"" category, but I prefer fun and more relaxed movies for multiple viewings.

# Favorite of the Year [Ranked in Order]

* **My Old Ass:** I expected to like this one, as a comedy. . .But I came out of the theater with tears in my eyes. Yea sure it's about a drug induced romp \[on the surface\], but as I get older I feel this one really spoke to me on a deeper level.
* **We Live in Time:** I don't know if I'll ever watch it again. It doesn't strike me as the type of movie that I am going to want to watch a second time, just because of the subject nature and how deeply sad it is. . .But it moved me pretty significantly as is the second time I've ever found myself crying at a movie theater.
* **Lisa Frankenstein:** I was surprised to learn some people really hated this one, because I think it was the perfect amount of fun. . and weird. . .and campy.

# I Enjoyed it and Would Watch Again

* **Deadpool & Wolverine:** It's just a fun love letter of a movie, right? I don't go to a Deadpool movie expecting everything to make sense. I just want a good old fashioned 4th wall breaking bromance, and this movie delivers.
* **Saturday Night:** The movie has a very frenetic energy to it and didn't give me a lot of breathing room to process different things going on, which is something that I typically don't enjoy. For some reason \[maybe it's the fact that I do watch SNL and kind of have that expectation anyway\] it just works, and I'd probably want to watch it again to see what nuances I might pick up on.
* **Inside Out 2:** Inside Out 2 does a far better job \[in my opinion\] of being a fun Disney sequel than Moana 2 does. I think I'd need to watch both entries of this franchise back to back to really decide which one I like better.
* **Heretic:** I don't know if I ever thought I'd see Hugh Grant in a horror movie like this. It hits all the notes that I expect from the genre, but I really liked the Book of Mormon x Horror vibe, and the almost chess like mentality his villain hits throughout the entire movie.
* **Fly Me to the Moon:** We live in a time where people just make shit up, so even though this takes place before the moon landing, it still sort of felt topical. . .Except it's also a very funny comedy.
* **Speak No Evil:** I'm writing this after writing a few other similar thoughts further down the list - Once again, another movie that feels totally ruined by the trailers. . Why do they keep doing this to us? Except it honestly doesn't even matter. The movie just works. . I'd watch it 10 more times just to see if I pick up on anything in the background.

# Enjoyed Far More Than I Expected

* **Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes:** I saw and enjoyed the first remake but have become disillusioned by the movies with each passing sequel. I really didn't think this would be very interesting, but was happily very surprised.
* **Civil War:** Given the political climate of The United States around the time that this started to promo/release, I was very nervous as to this one having a bullshit political agenda \[for either side\]. Given that it did not, and took steps to really make sure the audience couldn't try to pull an agenda out of it, I was able to fully enjoy the romp.
* **Gladiator II:** I'm getting sick of these 20 years later sequels and really had very low expectations for the movie. I don't think it's the amazing film my wife thinks that it is, but I was definitely. . .Entertained.
* **Trap:** I was really annoyed by the trailers for this movie, which seemingly gives away ""the big reveal"" and ruins the entire thing - Except they pull back that curtain very early in the movie, and it's a non issue. Really enjoyed this way more than I expected to.
* **The Fall Guy:** This is one of those movies I went into ready to be annoyed, because I had seen promos for it way too many times and was just sick of seeing that stupid trailer over and over again. I just had zero expectations going in and was pleasantly surprised. At the time of this blurb I think I've seen it 3 times, which is unusual for me.
* **Wicked:** Coming off the heels of Mean Girls. . And Dear Even Hanson. . And pretty much all modern Broadway movies, I had almost no expectations at all for this one. I love Broadway, and was ready to nap my way through it. . .Though Wicked definitely proved me wrong, that you can do a musical correctly.
* **The Iron Claw:** If you told me I'd ever feel bad for a jacked up Zac Efron I would have laughed at you, and yet here we are. The only thing that stops this from being a top contender for me is that technically it came out last year, though I saw it after that list.
* **Alien: Romulus:** I know I'll be crucified for saying this, but I've never seen a full Alien movie all the way through. It just wasn't ever my thing, though we both really enjoyed it. I have since wanted to make my way through a chronological of the entire series, though have found myself lacking time to get around to it.
* **I Saw The TV Glow:** This is a movie that I didn't expect very much from, other than having a weird nostalgia feel to it. I really enjoyed most of it, but as it started to get really trippy towards the end it lost me.
* **Twisters:** On the list of movies that I ever thought would get a sequel this far down the road? I mean Twister seems like an easy enough candidate with a very generic premise, but I never really imagined it would happen. . .And yet it works. . .It works because it's no more a sequel of Twister than any generic disaster movie is \[not\] a sequel to another generic disaster movie of the same disaster. . . Does that even make sense? I don't know, but it was fun.

# Enjoyed it, but Probably Wouldn't Watch Again

* **Here:** The movie is just different, unlike anything I've ever seen before. I don't know if the gimmick is worth a second viewing, but it captivated me on the first one.
* **Red One:** Generic holiday action romp, we've been getting a bunch of these in the last few years. Glad I saw it, don't regret the time spent. . .Might get 2-3 minutes of my time if I'm ever flipping through channels and it happens to be on.
* **A Real Pain:** If I wasn't limiting myself to 3 movies in ""Favorites of the Year,"" this would probably be number 4. . Though The ambiguity of the ending feels pointless \[there really isn't much to think about in that regard\]. 
* **Arthur the King:** This is probably the first movie that has ever made me legitimately cry. I walked out of the theater nearly bawling. I give it props for that, but I have no desire to subject myself to it again.
* **American Fiction:** I'd say the first 2 acts of the movie are almost perfect, but I really didn't care for the way they did the ending in multiple paths. Like. . I got it from an author perspective, but I just don't feel like it worked.
* **Challengers:** I think my wife has probably seen this 5 times since it came out. I don't know if I can watch it again. Its a slower moving film, which isn't really my thing - I enjoyed it, I liked it a lot actually, but I don't think I'll be returning to the couch to see it again.
* **Babes:** It's funny in the same way all of those comedies about a very specific situation being dramatized for comedy are funny. The movie works because its a premise that I haven't seen before. But I don't think the magic will work a second time.
* **Dune: Part Two:** Look, both Dune movies are very good. . And yea I've read the source material, but they're also very long and slow. I'm glad I saw it, but I don't need to watch it again.
* **The Bikeriders:** I'll be honest - I write these things at the end of the year, because I want to focus on the feelings of my experience, and not really the plot itself. . .And while I remember enjoying it, I also remember thinking it was very long; but other than that I couldn't give you much else.
* **Blink Twice:** Blink Twice covers some rough themes that people don't typically want to think about, but the movie works as a crazy drug induced thriller. There's a decent revenge payoff, and I go home happy.
* **Bob Marley: One Love:** No idea how accurate the movie is, but it's a fun ride.
* **Sonic The Hedgehog 3:** It's cute, just like the first 2. The story is pretty basic but I appreciate it's the type of movie that is made for kids, but the writers didn't forget that Sonic is a 90s icon, and that its older fans would be watching it too.

# The Mediocre Movie I Expected it to be

* **Beetlejuice Beetlejuice:** It hits a lot of the notes you need a sequel like this to hit, but I also felt like everything was reductive and surface level. We went with the in-laws, who loved it, but I didn't think it was that great.
* **Venom: The Last Dance:** Just like Venom 1 and 2 it has its moments - I'm not sure if 2 or 3 is the weaker movie, and I almost certainly will never watch it again, but I don't regret the time. . Or the laughs.
* **It Ends with Us:** I might be biased because my wife dragged me to this on the same weekend I dragged her to Borderlands, which maybe artificially props up my feelings of it - But I didn't totally hate it. 
* **A Quiet Place: Day One:** Is Day One necessary? Probably not. But I think it's definitely a better entry into this mythos than the sequel was.
* **Monkey Man**: Indian John Wick. . .It's decent, but nothing I haven't seen before.
* **Longlegs:** The movie isn't scary, and it's not really much of a thriller, but it certainly is creepy and Nicholas Cage has always played the weirdo card really well. . .Or that's just who he is.
* **Abigail:** It's just fun - There's nothing special about it - The reveal in the end isn't anything interesting, hell the ending itself is confusing with all the back and forth. But there are vampire ballerina kids, and that's just the kind of silliness we need sometimes.

# Expected More and Left Disappointed

* **MaXXXine:** Two years ago X was one of my top movies of the year. And even Pearl with all of its Wizard of Oz whimsy felt like a pretty strong movie. It's not that MaXXXine is a bad movie, I just expected more than a semi-generic horror/thriller. It felt as though the movie itself was written to be its own thing and the X mythos was just tacked onto it before shooting.
* **IF:** I don't really know what I was expecting with this one. . .But I always sort of hoped it would be some kind of Fosters Home for Imaginary Friends x Ryan Reynolds movie. It sort of just felt like too much was going on, and not enough was going on. . All at the same time.
* **Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire:** Afterlife may have been really reductive of previous Ghostbusters movies, but it was enjoyable and fun. Frozen Empire was just flat the entire time and at 2h4m it felt about 45 minutes longer than necessary.
* **The Book of Clarence**: I can't quite tell if this movie just wasn't for my particular audience, or if it just wasn't very good. But it felt very long and confusing the entire way through.
* **Imaginary:** Generic gimmick horror movie is generic gimmick horror movie. Nothing special, move along.
* **The Watchers:** I don't know why I expected more, that's stupid of me. I don't actually hate The Watchers, but I do think the whole ending is kind of stupid.
* **Y2K:** I wasn't expecting a masterpiece with this one, but I thought it would be a fun nostalgia trip. I do think the first 20-30 minutes are super solid, but once we start getting into the ""AI takes over the world"" problem the whole thing sort of just falls apart, and none of the payoff feels earned.
* **Moana 2:** The original is a true favorite of mine, but this one feels like it's exclusively for the kids. And that's totally fine, just wasn't for me.

# Didn't Expect Much, and Got What I Expected

* **The Crow:** I've actually never seen the original The Crow \[I know\] but I typically don't expect much from remakes/reimaginings anyway. There were parts that I ""didn't hate"" but overall it fell flat for me.
* **Mean Girls:** Mean Girls, the Broadway Show, is really good. This entire movie felt flat with a lot of the songs pushed into more monotone registers to makeup for hiring talent that didn't have very high vocal range. . Other than Renee Rapp. I also felt like a lot of the nods to the original movie were done in an ""ok fine we have to"" way, instead of honoring the source material.
* **The Front Room:** I didn't expect much. . Actually I don't know what I was expecting. . .Certainly it wasn't a seemingly ancient woman shitting herself constantly. It felt like The Front Room kept building to something that never paid off.
* **Immaculate:** Sydney Sweeny starring in ""i'm hot, oh but also I'm a nun that fucked up."" The movie has no substance to it and I was grateful when it was over. The only thing saving it from Worst of the Year is just how bad some of those movies are.

# Worst of the Year

* **Night Swim:** I liked the premise of this one and really wanted to like it, but it just felt like it was missing pretty much everything a good horror movie needs.
* **Madame Web:** This movie doesn't deserve my thoughts or punctuation
* **Borderlands:** I didn't expect Borderlands to be a good movie at all - It's one of my favorite game franchises and I had no hope that Hollywood wouldn't screw it up, but I was at least hoping for something that made sense and might hit the ""so bad it's good"" point. The movie is just bad, and oddly the one casting choice everyone thought made no sense \[Kevin Hart\] is the one casting choice that I felt actually worked.
* **Argylle:** This may be the worst movie I've ever seen, and I used to make a point to watch some of the worst movies \[as reviewed on IMDB\] as a fun group activity with friends. At no point in its incoherent rambling did Argylle make any sense, and I wish it would be erased from my brain.

**Note:** At roughly $23/m for the AMC subscription that means I spent about $5/ticket to see each movie. My wife sometimes do buy concessions \[sometimes with points, sometimes without\], maybe next year I'll track that too, just to see how expensive a hobby this actually is.

**Movies we will probably see in the next week:**

venom2,venom 2,1hfxc9z,"December 13-15 Box Office Recap: 'Kraven the Hunter' and 'The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim' massively flop. Meanwhile, 'Moana 2' crosses $700 million worldwide, and 'Interstellar' finally crosses $200 million domestically.","https://preview.redd.it/xi19z0g5ta7e1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbcef545fce2b03a13f66a8bb3efbda972af2d6f

The man finally came around.

***Moana 2*** was still on top of the box office, although the gap between it and ***Wicked*** is becoming smaller. We got two newcomers this week and both were colossal failures. ***Kraven the Hunter*** ended the SSU on a new low, while ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** finished outside the Top 5. In limited release, ***Nickel Boys*** had a solid start, while ***September 5*** disappointed.

The Top 10 earned a combined $87.6 million this weekend. That's up 27% from last year, when ***Wonka*** debuted on top.

***Moana 2*** threepeated on the top spot, earning $26.4 million. That's a 48% drop, which is quite rough after its steep second weekend drop. After a record-breaking opening weekend, the legs are proving to be quite front-loaded. The film has earned $337.3 million, and it's now guaranteed to miss $500 million domestically. And depending on how much it drops against ***Mufasa*** and ***Sonic***, it could miss $450 million domestically.

***Wicked*** was still on second place, but it's getting close to ***Moana 2***. It earned $22.6 million this weekend, which was just 38% down from last weekend. The film has amassed $359.1 million, and it's now poised to earn more domestically than ***Moana 2***. It could start overtaking it next weekend, assuming it doesn't have a bad drop against ***Mufasa*** and ***Sonic***.

Debuting in third place, ***Kraven the Hunter*** flopped with just $11 million in 3,211 theaters. That's the worst debut in the SSU (Spider-Manless Spider-Man Universe), and one of the worst for a Marvel property. Hell, it even debuted below ***Kick-Ass*** ($19 million), another R-rated comic book movie starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson.

This is not really a surprise. I mean, where do we start?

The SSU has earned a cumulative $2.1 billion worldwide. But the *Venom* films account for $1.83 billion of that, which is like 86% of its gross. The other two films, ***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***, were critical and commercial duds, becoming Internet's laughingstock. Even the ***Venom*** films are already losing good will among the general audience. Basically, it's a universe with absolutely nothing to offer, where the bar keeps going lower and lower. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me six times...

But how could ***Kraven*** open below ***Madame Web***? On top of having lost any audience interest after the amount of trash released, ***Kraven*** barely felt like a comic book movie. The trailers emphasized brutal action, but it only reinforced that it felt like a generic action flick that come every couple weeks. The character of Kraven might be known for its hunt for Spider-Man, yet obviously we find ourselves in another lame attempt to give a villain a standalone origin story. With no signs of Spider-Man.

For some reason, Sony decided that ***Kraven*** warranted a big budget. The film was originally set at $90 million, which rose to $110 million due to the strikes (although some reports say that it actually cost $130 million). That's almost on par with the previous ***Venom*** film, and it's way too high for a C-lister. Especially when they made it R-rated. Sony is aware that this universe isn't working; [TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/kraven-the-hunter-sony-marvel-universe-spider-man-box-office/) reported that Sony will stop developing films for this universe, choosing to focus on ***Spider-Man 4***, ***Beyond the Spider-Verse*** and the ***Spider-Noir*** series. They admitted defeat before the film even came out.

There was some slight hope that J.C. Chandor's presence would also lead to a competent film. But that was not the case; it's currently at an awful 15% on RT. Nothing but a paycheck. 

According to Sony, 71% of the audience was male, which is higher than usual for a comic book title. 40% of the audience was 35 and over. They gave it a horrible ""C"" on CinemaScore, which is even worse than ***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***. If you think these numbers look bad, just wait for the second weekend drop. Even with the holiday season, it's unlikely ***Kraven*** can hit $30 million domestically. A comparison could be ***Star Trek: Nemesis***, which also opened on December 13. After disappointing with $18 million, it closed with just $43 million. If it follows the same trajectory, ***Kraven*** will finish with just $25 million. Yike.

After its rough drop, ***Gladiator II*** slightly recovered. It dropped 39%, earning $7.6 million this weekend. Looks like ***Kraven*** barely had an impact. The film has earned $145.7 million, and it should finish with close to $170 million.

Barely cracking the Top 5 was ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim***, which flopped with just $4.5 million this weekend. There's no point in even comparing it to the ***Lord of the Rings*** trilogy, which earned over 10 times this number on their first opening weekend.

While ***The Lord of the Rings*** is a massively popular franchise, there was a ceilling to this project when it was announced that it would be an anime prequel. To understand how anime has a ceilling; last year, ***The Boy and the Heron***, with all the buzz it could achieve, made $46 million domestically. That's far less than what other animated films can earn. Warner Bros. knew this couldn't be a big moneymaker, which is why they only spent $30 million on the film, and released it in just 2,602 theaters.

It has been reported that the film's existence was fast-tracked to prevent New Line from losing the film adaptation rights for Tolkien's novels. Although with the recent announcement of a ***Hunt for Gollum*** film coming in 2026, it was clear ***Rohirrim*** wouldn't really be a priority. If people were on the fence over this film, the film's middling reviews (51% on RT) indicated that this wasn't worth it.

According to Warner Bros., 68% of the audience was male and 66% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a lukewarm ""B"" on CinemaScore, far worse than any Middle-Earth film. This is not gonna last long in theaters; it'd be a surprise if this earned over $15 million lifetime.

Despite being available on Prime Video, ***Red One*** dropped just 39% this weekend, adding $4.2 million. The film has earned $92.4 million, and it's fighting to hit $100 million.

It took 10 years, but Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** has crossed $200 million domestically. The IMAX re-release added $3.6 million, which was just 21% down from last weekend. Fantastic all around.

***Pushpa 2: The Rule*** fell 67% this weekend, adding $1.6 million and taking its domestic total to $13 million.

***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** eased just 14% and added $1.2 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $36.6 million.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer***, which expanded to 460 theaters this weekend. That allowed it to increase again, earning $790,954. The film's domestic total stands at $1.9 million, and it will need some Oscar buzz here.

***Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem*** finished outside the Top 10 with $737K during the weekend ($2.3 million four-day).

A24's ***Y2K*** lost 160 theaters and fell 68%, earning $684,957 this weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned just $3.7 million, and it's gonna miss $5 million.

Paramount released ***September 5***, an awards hopeful, into 7 theaters. But the film earned $80,802, which translates to a very underwhelming $11,543 per-theater average. The film will expand nationwide on January 17, 2025, but this is a very weak start.

Amazon MGM's ***Nickel Boys*** debuted in 2 theaters, and earned $54,794 this weekend. That's a solid $27,397 per-theater average, and it will continue expanding in the coming weeks.

Gia Coppola's ***The Last Showgirl*** debuted in one single screen, earning $50,300 this weekend. That's a fantastic per-theater average, making it the fifth highest of the year. It will hit nationwide in January.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Moana 2*** was once again topping the overseas box office. It added $57 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $716.8 million. The best markets are France ($40.5M), UK ($33.5M), Germany ($24.8M), Mexico ($23.5M) and Brazil ($21.1M). It's gonna the billion milestone, but it's taking some time in getting there.

***Wicked*** added $21.5 million, and its worldwide total is now $525 million. It debuted in Germany with $4 million, which is the best for a Broadway film. The film's best markets are the UK ($55.2M), Australia ($20.1M), Korea ($12M), Mexico ($9M) and Philippines ($5M). It will hit its final market, Japan, on February.

***Kraven the Hunter*** also flopped overseas. It earned just $15 million, taking its worldwide debut to just $26 million. For comparison, ***Madame Web*** earned $49 million on its worldwide debut and closed with just $100 million. There's a strong chance ***Kraven*** finishes below $60 million worldwide.

After missing the mark domestically, ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** also flopped overseas, earning only $4 million overseas. That's a paltry $9.9 million worldwide.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Smile 2* | Oct/18 | Paramount | $23,021,692 | $68,967,012 | $137,991,092 | $28M

- Paramount's ***Smile 2*** has closed with $137 million worldwide. While that's a 37% drop from the original, it's still a box office success. Reception as a whole was much better than the first, with Naomi Scott earning praise for her performance. ***Smile 3: This Time It's Personal*** should be coming anytime now.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

***Moana 2*** will cede the top spot, and it's a battle between a lion and a hedgehog.

Disney is releasing ***Mufasa: The Lion King***, five years after the 2019 remake earned over $1.6 billion worldwide. Jon Favreau was replaced with Barry Jenkins, and the film will serve as a prequel depicting a young Mufasa and Scar. This is a strong IP, but this is uncharted territories, given that this is a completely new story with new songs. It's not gonna come anywhere close to that $1.6 billion gross, but we'll see how much it can make.

The other release is ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3***. The franchise is going strong, and this film has added Keanu Reeves as Shadow, which drew hype among the Internet. The trailers have done a fantastic job in selling the film, and the pre-sales look very strong so far. With the holiday corridor, another increase is pretty much imminent.

In limited release, A24 is opening Brady Corbet's ***The Brutalist***. It stars Adrien Brody as László Tóth, a Hungarian-born Jewish architect who survives the Holocaust and emigrates to the United States, where he struggles to achieve the American Dream until a wealthy client changes his life. The film has received fantastic reviews so far, and it's poised to become a big Oscar player. Look for a healthy run, even if the 215-minute runtime might be too much for many.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-1236245428/) (40):

>I’ve seen much worse comic-book movies than “Kraven the Hunter,” but maybe the best way to sum up my feelings about the film is to confess that I didn’t stay to see if there was a post-credits teaser. That’s a dereliction of duty, but it’s one I didn’t commit on purpose. I simply hadn’t bothered to think about it.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-marvel-1236200914/):

>It turns out to be a spectacular action- and character-driven performance from Aaron Taylor-Johnson and some tight exciting filmmaking from director J.C. Chandor, whose previous films, other than Triple Frontier, are far more indie in style and scope


[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/marvel-movies/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (50):

>Though closer in quality to Morbius than Venom, Kraven is far from a catastrophe and serves up a decent helping of bloodthirsty, globe-trotting action. Taylor-Johnson makes a muscular if self-satisfied protagonist in a film that would have been better off standing on its own shoeless feet than cravenly (or should that be, 'kravenly') cleaving itself to its comic book brethren.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review-1235075341/) (C-):

>Immune to fan response, impervious to quality control, and so broadly unencumbered by its place in a shared universe that most of its scenes don’t even feel like they take place in the same *film*, “Kraven the Hunter” might be very, very bad (and by “might be” I mean “almost objectively is”), but the more relevant point is that it feels like it was made by people who have no idea what today’s audiences might consider as “good.

[Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/) (50):

>After nine years, Aaron Taylor-Johnson returns to Marvel superhero fare, but while Kraven the Hunter has potential, it's a middling origin story.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1735558/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/?taid=6759efc37ea5c90001a8bc6e&utm_campaign=feed&utm_medium=Social-Distribution&utm_source=TWX-BP-SlashFilm) (50):

>Sony, still possessing the film rights to Spider-Man, decided to make an interconnected Spider-Man Villain universe, of which ""Kraven the Hunter"" is the final chapter. Watching Chandor's film, though, one can see that neither the studio nor the filmmakers are interested in starting anything anymore. There is no presumption that fans will be interested in long-form mythmaking, and sequel teases remain light. This allows ""Kraven"" to be stupid on its own. And, in a weird way, that's a relief. We're free.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/11/kraven-the-hunter-review-russell-crowe-busts-up-laborious-superhero-yarn) (2/5):

>Crowe’s safari-going Russian oligarch is the main redeeming feature of this Spider-Man-adjacent tale but there’s not much to like elsewhere

[The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/kraven-the-hunter-review) (67):

>Kraven The Hunter gets closer than any of its predecessors to understanding the silly, entertaining freedom of shedding continuity. Then again, maybe it’s best that this misbegotten series quits while it’s just-barely ahead.

[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson/) (1/5):

>If you thought Morbius and Madame Web were bad, the extended Spider-Man Universe hits a new rock bottom with this diabolical entry

[Collider](https://collider.com/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (3/10):

>*Kraven the Hunter*'s bland storytelling, subpar acting, and staggering technical issues are proof that the *Spider-Man* IP needs to be protected before it becomes an endangered species.

Directed by J.C. Chandor:

>Kraven has a complex relationship with his father which sets him on a path of vengeance and motivates him to become the greatest and most feared hunter.

venom2,venom 2,1ham66n,"December 6-8 Box Office Recap: 'Moana 2' stayed on top of the box office, earning almost $600 million worldwide after just 2 weeks. The 'Interstellar' IMAX re-release earned $4.6 million from just 165 theaters. Meanwhile, A24's 'Y2K' flopped in ninth place with just $2.1 million.","https://preview.redd.it/qi1cxbn2ew5e1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e4ef17a901777c7190d7c99319350a23894bbf8

Thanks to the excellent performance last week, this was a fantastic post-Thanksgiving weekend at the box office. ***Moana 2*** broke the record for highest post-Thanksgiving weekend at the box office, while ***Wicked*** and ***Gladiator II*** continued their run. As is typical with the weekend, studios avoid releasing big stuff. The biggest push was A24's ***Y2K***, which delivered one of the worst debuts for a film playing in over 2,000 theaters. In contrast, the IMAX re-release of ***Interstellar*** fared much better in just 165 theaters.

The Top 10 earned a combined $128.1 million this weekend. That's up a colossal 115% from last year, when ***The Boy and the Heron*** opened in North America. It's the best post-Thanksgiving weekend in history.

Without any competition, ***Moana 2*** easily held the top spot with $51.2 million this weekend. That represents a 63% drop, which is a little steeper than usual for the post-Thanksgiving weekend. It's worse than ***Wish*** (61%), ***Frozen II*** (59%), ***Strange World*** (58%), ***Ralph Breaks the Internet*** (54%), ***Frozen*** (53%), ***Encanto*** (52%), and the original ***Moana*** (50%).

Through 12 days, the film has earned $299.3 million domestically, already eclipsing the original ***Moana***. For a comparison, it had a huge start over ***Inside Out 2***, but it's now running almost $60 million behind that through the same point. It should hit $500 million for the holidays, but the $600 million dream appears to be dead.

***Wicked*** stayed at #2, dropping 55% and adding $36.4 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to a fantastic $322.1 million, and it should finish with over $450 million.

***Gladiator II*** dropped a rough 59%, adding $12.5 million this weekend. The film has earned $132.8 million so far, and it's gonna close with a little over $150 million unless the holidays surprise us.

Amazon MGM's ***Red One*** dropped 45%, adding $7 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $85.7 million. We'd like to say it will hit $100 million, but that's pretty much Joever; Amazon announced just today that the film will start streaming on Prime Video this Thursday. That's gonna kill legs.

The Indian film ***Pushpa 2: The Rule*** opened with $4.88 million in 1,245 theaters, which grows to $9.3 million in its first five days.

Paramount re-released Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** in 165 IMAX theaters. It earned a huge $4.6 million in these locations, which translates to a $27K per-theater average. IMAX reported that the 10 screenings that ran the film on 70mm sold out. These numbers took its lifetime gross to $192.6 million.

Sony/Crunchyroll's ***Solo Leveling: ReAwakening*** earned $2.4 million from just $846 theaters. Not bad for a recap of the first season.

Fathom Events released the concert film ***For King + Country’s A Drummer Boy Christmas Live*** in 1,540 theaters, for a limited 4-day run. It finished in eighth place with $2.2 million ($2.8 million four-day).

Debuting in ninth place, we find A24's ***Y2K***, which flopped with just $2.1 million in 2,108 theaters. That's a poor $1,003 per-theater average, suggesting a lot of empty screenings. It is the 33rd worst debut for a film in over 2,000 theaters. 

This shouldn't be a big surprise to anyone. The film lacked big names, with the big emphasis on its writer and director, Kyle Mooney. Mooney is definitely well known for ***Saturday Night Live***, but like a lot of stars in the show, that doesn't mean people will flock to watch that star on the screen. Horror is a profitable genre, but the film is actually a horror comedy, making it a tougher sell. A24 takes a lot of risks, but it was clear that this would struggle. Since its SXSW premiere, reviews have been mixed, and they've been worsening (currently at 43% on RT), making it one of the worst titles of the studio. It's simply a film that couldn't find an audience.

According to A24, 58% of the audience was male, and 77% was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it an awful ""C–"" on CinemaScore, suggesting the film will fade quickly from theaters. A run under $5 million is a possibility, and the film could be gone from theaters by the time New Year arrives. Not the best years for Rachel Zegler, apparently.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Lionsgate's ***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever***. It fell 53%, adding $1.5 million this weekend and taking its total to $34.4 million.

Outside the Top 10, we find ***Werewolves***, a horror action title with Frank Grillo. It hit 1,351 theaters, but it flopped with just $1 million this weekend. Don't expect it to last long.

Vertical also decided to release Justin Kurzel's ***The Order*** in 603 theaters, but it only made $878,000 this weekend. Ouch.

A24 expanded Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer*** to 47 theaters. It added $405,910 this weekend, taking its run to $866K after 10 days. It will continue expanding.

Searchlight didn't even bother with ***Nightbitch***. Not only did they dump it in 82 theaters, but they didn't release box office numbers. Le sigh.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Moana 2*** continued leading the box office after its record-breaking weekend. It added $103.7 million overseas, taking its worldwide numbers to $599 million. Its biggest debut was Japan, where it opened with $6.5 million. The best markets so far are France ($32.5M), UK ($27.2M), Germany ($19.7M), Mexico ($19.1M) and Brazil ($16M). A billion is imminent, but it looks like it will take a little while.

While ***Wicked*** registering strong numbers domestically, it continues performing softly overseas. This weekend, it added $26.9 million, taking its worldwide total to $457.5 million. It had very soft debuts in France ($2M), Netherlands ($1.9M) and Poland ($900K). The best markets are the UK ($47.4M), Australia ($17.2M), South Korea ($10.6M), Mexico ($8.1M) and Spain ($4.5M). It will open in more markets, but it's not like it will suddenly explode. If it was performing on par with its domestic run, we'd say a billion is a possibility, but that's not the case here. 70% of its money is coming from the domestic market, which is crazy.

***Gladiator II*** added $17 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $368.5 million. The film is slowing down, and while it will hit $400 million, it won't get much further than that. Far below the original's $460 million worldwide total.

***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** opened in 31 markets, mostly Latin America, a week ahead of its worldwide rollout. To say that it performed badly would be an understatement. The film debuted with an awful $2 million. It had terrible starts in Spain ($347K), Mexico ($239K), Thailand ($146K), Brazil ($106K), and Czech Republic ($103K). Yep, not a single market over $1 million. This suggests the film is heading for very ugly numbers in the rest of the world.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Here* | Nov/1 | Sony | $4,875,195 | $12,227,851 | $13,295,076 | $50M

- Wake up babe, new Zemeckis flop just dropped. After barely one month in theaters, Sony/Miramax's ***Here*** has closed with just $12 million domestically and $13 million worldwide. Despite touting the film as a ***Forrest Gump*** reunion (Zemeckis, Roth, Hanks and Wright), the audience was uninterested. In fact, the domestic total is barely half of what ***Forrest Gump*** earned on its opening weekend back in 1994, and that's not even adjusted. Oh, Robert Zemeckis, what happened to you? To say that his glory days have passed...

#**THIS WEEKEND**

Five films, two of which are hitting wide release. But none stand a chance in topping the box office.

The first is Sony's latest addition in the Spider-Manless Spider-Man Universe, ***Kraven the Hunter***. This universe has been mostly profitable, but it carries an asterisk. The three ***Venom*** films are hits, while the other two (***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***) flopped and became Internet's laughingstock. ***Kraven*** is leaning towards the latter. And for reasons beyond understand, Sony decided that this film warranted $130 million, making it their most expensive SSU film. After this, who knows what'll happen.

The other wide release is Warner Bros.'s ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim***, an anime prequel to Peter Jackson's trilogy. This franchise is one of the most powerful in film history... yet ***The War of the Rohirrim*** is not gonna come close anywhere close to that. Anime has a ceilling at the box office, and the pre-sales are insanely low. With a low screen count, limited marketing, and middling reviews so far, we'll see how low it can go.

Paramount is releasing ***September 5*** in limited release, before its wide release on January 17. The film recounts the 1972 Munich Olympic hostage crisis from the perspective of the ABC Sports crew and their coverage of the events. The film has received some solid reviews so far.

Amazon MGM is releasing ***Nickel Boys*** in limited release. The story follows two African American boys, Elwood and Turner, who are sent to an abusive reform school called the Nickel Academy in 1960s Florida. The film has received critical acclaim, and there's Oscar buzz on the horizon. Watch out for this one.

The other one is Gia Coppola's ***The Last Showgirl***, starring Pamela Anderson. Reviews are very positive, with Anderson lauded for a career-best performance.

To say that it was a great Thanksgiving weekend would be selling it short.

***Moana 2*** surpassed every expectation and delivered a record-breaking debut for the Thanksgiving weekend. And with the aid of ***Wicked*** and ***Gladiator II***, it was the busiest weekend of the year.

The Top 10 earned a combined $269.2 million this weekend ($412.8 million five-day). That's not just a colossal 210% up from last year, but it's also the biggest Thanksgiving weekend ever.

Debuting on top, ***Moana 2*** earned a colossal $139.7 million in 4,200 theaters. Adding its numbers from Wednesday, the debut rises to $225.4 million in five days. It broke so many records, including the biggest debut for a Walt Disney Animation Studios film debut, as well as the highest Thanksgiving weekend. But most importantly; it beat ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** ($204.6 million) for the biggest Wednesday-to-Sunday debut. 

A fantastic debut all around, and it shouldn't be a surprise. If you've followed the Top 10 charts on streaming, you'll find that ***Moana*** has been one of the most streamed films in the past years. It was even reported that it was the most streamed film across all services last year. Needless to say, ***Moana*** became far more popular with years, and audiences hoped for a sequel to come.

Disney, for some reason, was interested in doing it but only as a TV show for Disney+. In February 2024, it was revealed that the show was retooled into a film that would hit theaters this Thanksgiving. With an extensive marketing campaign, Disney successfully got people into giving this film a chance. 

According to Disney, 65% of the audience was female, and 60% was 18 and over. Critics were not enthused with the film, and it currently sits at 64% on RT. The audience was more forgiving, giving it an ""A–"" on CinemaScore, although that falls on the lower end of WDAS titles. There are no animated titles on its way until ***Dog Man*** in January, so it can leg out through the holidays. $500 million is pretty much guaranteed, and can go as high as $600 million if it can hold very well.

After defying gravity on its opening weekend, ***Wicked*** continued flying high. It earned $81.1 million this weekend ($118.2 million five-day). That marks an insane 28% drop, which breaks the record set by ***Top Gun: Maverick*** (29%) as the smallest drop for a $100+ million opener. Of course, ***Maverick*** achieved that record on the weekend after Memorial Day, but it didn't face a $100+ million opener on its second weekend.

Through ten days, ***Wicked*** has earned a colossal $263.1 million domestically. It's already the highest grossing Broadway musical adaptation, passing ***Grease*** ($188 million). Of course, ***Grease*** is still ahead in terms of adjusted inflation ($770 million), but ***Wicked*** remains a colossal success. It should hit $400 million without any problem, and the holidays can help it get close to $500 million by the end of its run.

Paramount's ***Gladiator II*** added $31 million this weekend. That represents a 44% drop, which is fine, but not fantastic considering how well the other holdovers did. Through 10 days, Ridley Scott's sequel has earned $111.4 million, passing ***Robin Hood*** and ***Black Hawk Down*** to become Scott's 6th highest grossing film domestically. The film should finish with over $150 million domestically, quite down from the original's $187 million lifetime gross.

After a steep second weekend drop, Amazon MGM's ***Red One*** eased a light 4%, adding $12.7 million this weekend. The film has earned $75.8 million so far, and depending on next week's drop, it could still hit $100 million. Although it's hard to call this a bonafide hit considering its colossal $250 million budget.

Lionsgate's ***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** was still on the Top 5, easing just 6% and adding $3.2 million. The film has earned $31.9 million domestically.

In sixth place, Angel Studios' ***Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin*** fell 54% and added $2.3 million this weekend ($3.3 million five-day). That's a very weak drop, especially considering it had Thanksgiving. Through ten days, the film has amassed $9.6 million and will close with less than $15 million.

***Venom: The Last Dance*** is still holding well, dipping 43% this weekend and adding $2.2 million. The film has amassed $137.8 million so far, which is still far behind the previous ***Venom*** films.

A24's ***Heretic*** continues falling. This weekend, it fell 57% and added $956K this weekend. With $26.8 million in the bank, it's now gonna finish below $30 million.

In the face of ***Moana 2***, DreamWorks' ***The Wild Robot*** had its worst drop yet. It collapsed 67% this weekend, adding $700,000 to its run. The film has earned $142.5 million, and it's nearing the end of its run.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Searchlight's ***A Real Pain***, which recovered after its weak drop last weekend. The film dipped 39%, grossing $655,910 this weekend. The film has earned just $6.1 million, and barring some huge Oscar noms, it looks like it might miss $10 million.

Outside the Top 10 was Focus Features' ***Conclave***, which dipped 46% and earned $616,955 this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $30.1 million domestically. A damn great run for an adult drama.

Neon's ***Anora*** is winding down, and it's now playing in just 230 theaters. This weekend, it dipped 43% and added $385,292. Its domestic total stands at $12.7 million.

A24 debuted Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer*** in 7 theaters, earning $188,808. That translates to a $26,973 per-theater average, which is quite middling (it barely cracks the top 20 highest PTA of the year). For comparison, it's barely above ***Bones and All*** ($24,201), and far below ***Suspiria*** ($92,019) and ***Call Me By Your Name*** ($103,233). The film will continue expanding through the holidays.

#**OVERSEAS**

The records don't stop just in America for ***Moana 2***.

***Moana 2*** debuted with a colossal $163 million overseas, which means it debuted with $389.2 million worldwide. That broke ***Mario***'s record ($377 million) for the biggest animated debut in history. The biggest markets were France ($18.8M), UK ($15.5M), Mexico ($11.1M), Germany ($10.5M), Italy ($9.3M), South Korea ($9.1M), Australia ($8.3M), Brazil ($7.5M), China ($6.5M) and Spain ($5.5M). An easy billion right here, ladies and gentlemen. 

***Wicked*** is a monster hit domestically, but that popularity hasn't fully connected with the rest of the world. This weekend, the film earned $29 million from the overseas markets, taking the worldwide total to $360.3 million. It's still killing it in the UK ($36M) and Australia ($12.9M), and it has performed well in South Korea ($8.5M), Mexico ($6.7M), and Philippines ($3.5M). The rest of the markets... not so much. While it still has some markets left, the film will be domestic-heavy. The film is cleary a hit, but it's crazy how the domestic market represents a huge 73% of its worldwide gross.

***Gladiator II*** added $27.2 million this weekend, and its worldwide total is now $320.2 million. The best markets are the UK ($29.7M), France ($22.5M), Spain ($15M), Mexico ($12.9M) and Australia ($11.5M). The film should pass the original's $272 million foreign gross, but it's unlikely it can pass its worldwide gross ($460 million).

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Beetlejuice Beetlejuice* | Sep/6 | Warner Bros. | $111,003,345 | $294,100,435 | $450,053,961 | $100M
*Saturday Night* | Sep/27 | Sony | $3,400,583 | $9,509,312 | $9,752,378 | $25M
*Terrifier 3* | Oct/11 | Cineverse | $18,928,113 | $53,981,071 | $94,436,616 | $2M

- 36 years in the making and it paid off, as ***Beetlejuice Beetlejuice*** closed with a fantastic $294 million domestically, finishing as Burton's second highest grossing film, just a little behind ***Alice in Wonderland*** ($334 million). Interestingly, that popularity wasn't as strong overseas, as the domestic market represented 65.3% of its worldwide gross. It's still a great $450 million worldwide, although ***Alice*** ($1 billion) and ***Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*** ($474 million) finished far higher. Despite a few duds here and there, Tim Burton is still as popular as he's ever been.

- ***Saturday Night Live*** might be popular 50 years later, but that doesn't mean the audience is interested in a film depicting its first ever broadcast. That was the case for Jason Reitman's ***Saturday Night***, which closed with a very poor $9.5 million domestically. The film was positioned as an Oscars contender, but the film fizzled out by the time it hit wide release and faded quickly. Don't expect the rest of the world to save it, given that ***Saturday Night Live*** isn't as popular as the States. 

- Last month, we had two movies revolving around a clown as its protagonist. ***Joker: Folie à Deux*** became one of the worst received comic book films of all time, allowing Art the Clown to emerge as the winner of the month. And now, ***Terrifier 3*** has closed with a damn fantastic $94 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing unrated film ever. Shattered the ceilling of what a film like this could achieve, and elevating Art to one of the most iconic horror villains of modern times. Damien Leone has already confirmed a fourth film is coming up. Art in space when?

#**THIS WEEKEND**

The post-Thanksgiving weekend is usually a dumping ground for studios. With the Christmas season kicking off, people are busy, which is why studios avoid releasing anything big. It's up to the small films to get a chance. This weekend, we have two newcomers and none of them stand a chance in dethroning ***Moana 2***. None will even touch $10 million this weekend.

The only one with a confirmed wide release is A24's ***Y2K***, which marks Kyle Mooney's debut as writer and director. The film stars Jaeden Martell, Julian Dennison, Rachel Zegler, Fred Durst, and Alicia Silverstone, and depicts an imaginative version of the Year 2000 problem, where a bug causes all technology to come to life and turn against humanity. The film has received mixed reviews (63% on RT), and horror comedies have not performed well as of late. We'll see how it does, but a debut under A24's ***Heretic*** ($10.8 million) seems pretty much imminent.

The other film, although in far less theaters, is Searchlight's ***Nightbitch***. A film that stars Amy Adams as a mother who transforms into a dog. Like, seriously. Y'all complain about lack of originality in Hollywood? Well, here's a very unique premise. Reviews are quite similar to ***Y2K***, and marketing has been very limited so far. This suggests it won't be a very wide release.

And for those curious, Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** is returning to theaters this Friday for a limited time on IMAX screens. You should hurry up, for screenings are quickly getting sold out.

venom2,venom 2,1gosvwj,I've watched almost 200 unseen movies as part of a weekly challenge for myself. What should be my 200th movie? ,"Since April 2021, I've engaged in a personal challenge where once a week I watch one film I haven't watched before; an unseen movie. It can be a newly released film or it can be decades old; it just has to be one I haven't watched yet. I've watched plenty of films before doing this and honestly my number of total films I've watched is probably closer to 500 at least.

But anyway, sometime in December I will be watching my 200th film as part of my weekly challenge. My problem is that I want it to be a really good film to celebrate doing this for almost 200 weeks (It's probably more like 195 weeks but whatever). My 100th film was Good Will Hunting, which was probably one of the best films I watched in 2023, so I'm looking for something along the lines of that in terms of a classic movie.

So with all that in mind, what you recommend be my 200th film?

I have a list of all the films I've watched as part of my challenge, which is fairly diversified. I said my total film count is higher but just assume these are the only ones I've watched. Or if you want, make an educated guess at what films I've already seen based on the list.

Reviews:

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/venom-the-last-dance-review-tom-hardy-chiwetel-ejiofor-1236185751/):

>The “Venom” films are part of Sony’s Spider-Man Universe (that is such a tedious sentence to write, let alone contemplate). And maybe that’s why Tom Hardy, from the first “Venom” on, has chosen to offset the uncoolness of doing a comic-book franchise by putting his slumming in quotation marks, playing Eddie as a borderline doofus who talks like a grown-up version of one of the Bowery Boys. The performance has worked, in a certain way, because it kept the whole series light. But it has also ensured that the “Venom” movies are a lark and nothing more, geared to the arrested pleasure centers of fanboys: the more snark and CGI the better.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/10/venom-the-last-dance-review-tom-hardy-1236156179/):

>It’s not the best of its kind, but by no means the worst, and even when the inevitable war breaks out between humans, xenophages and symbiotes, Marcel orchestrates the action in a surprisingly comprehensible style that’s more reminiscent of Ang Lee’s underrated Hulk than the ultra-Michael Bay chaos that comes with most CG smackdowns. It’s small recompense, however, for the sight of Venom disco-dancing to ABBA in a Vegas penthouse; surely no one will ever take the threat of a symbiote invasion seriously after that.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/venom-the-last-dance-review-tom-hardy-marvel-1236042242/) (60):

>Hardy brings sufficient charm (and witty voice work) to his symbiote-inhabited character’s internal battle between id and superego to make each entry diverting enough, even if they leave little aftertaste. And so it goes with Venom: The Last Dance, which caps the trilogy by going gleefully out on its own.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/venom-the-last-dance-review-1235059391/) (58):

>Despite the film’s best efforts to melt its characters into the vast sludge of superhero cinema, the union between Eddie and Venom is simply too pure to be diluted down to nothing. Thanks to Hardy, even the least of the movies in this franchise is definitely something, and it’s something that its genre may not be able to survive without.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1695477/venom-the-last-dance-tom-hardy-marvel-movie-review/) (40):

>If there is one bright spot in ""Venom: The Last Dance,"" it's Tom Hardy. Once again doing a questionable voice while vibing on his weirdo energy, Hardy makes Eddie Brock an almost tragic figure; a lonely guy cut off from the rest of the world, with only a wisecracking alien monster for company. He shuffles about like a man uncomfortable in his own skin, looking awkward and aghast. He's operating on a different level than this lousy film. Unfortunately, he's not getting much backup. 

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/venom-the-last-dance-review-tom-hardy) (4/10):

>Venom: The Last Dance trips over its own tendrils and lets a boring, generic plot, and bad action distract from the surprisingly resilient central relationship between Eddie Brock and his symbiote bestie.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/venom-the-last-dance/) (40):

>It’s third time unlucky for a series that still hasn’t worked out what it wants to be. The Last Dance can’t find its rhythm.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/venom-the-last-dance-review-tom-hardy/):

>“Venom: The Last Dance” really wants you to think it’s the end. Throughout the film, Venom talks about wanting to see the Statue of Liberty like a cop with two weeks until retirement talks about taking his wife on a long-delayed boat trip, right after one final case. There’s a suggestion of a sequel but it plays more like a threat: “If you see this movie we’ll make you watch another one.” So maybe let’s not. If this is what Sony thinks the “Venom” movies should be like, they can keep it. What a lousy way to say goodbye. No greatest hits. Just a strikeout.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/23/venom-the-last-dance-review-tom-hardy-marvel) (2/5):

>It’s quick and brash and seemingly aware of how goofy so much of it is but it’s also awkwardly overstuffed.


Directed by Kelly Marcel:

>Eddie and Venom are on the run. Hunted by both of their worlds and with the net closing in, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on Venom and Eddie's last dance.

venom2,venom 2,1fsie52,what is your most anticipated movie release of october 2024?,"as quickly as it arrived, september is coming to an end. this means the start of october and, by extension, the spooky season. but, not only is october famous for it's abundance of scary movies, it's also the month where the oscar bait movies start coming out. with only 37 days before the climax of a highly contentious election on which the very future of america may depend, people will probably be looking for anyway to distract themselves. what better way to do that then by going to the movies.

which of the highly anticipated october releases are you most excited for?

venom2,venom 2,1cu0h1d,When Studios Meddle: How Interference Can Ruin Great Movies,"I wanted to start a discussion on a topic that really grinds my gears: when studios meddle with movies and end up ruining what could have been great films. Two prime examples that come to mind are ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" and Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 3."" Both of these films had so much potential but were ultimately bogged down by studio interference.

# The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (TASM 2)

TASM 2 had a lot going for it. Andrew Garfield was an excellent Spider-Man, and the chemistry between him and Emma Stone was electric. But instead of focusing on a coherent storyline, the studio decided to cram in multiple villains and set up future movies. Electro, Green Goblin, and the half-baked Rhino all in one movie? It was too much, too fast. The result was a jumbled mess that failed to do justice to any of the characters.

# Spider-Man 3

Sam Raimi’s ""Spider-Man 3"" is another classic case of studio interference gone wrong. Raimi wanted to focus on Sandman and Harry Osborn’s storyline, but the studio insisted on including Venom to appeal to fans. The result was an overstuffed plot that couldn’t give any of the storylines the attention they deserved. The forced inclusion of Venom felt out of place and led to a disjointed narrative that disappointed many fans, including myself.

# The Amazing Spider-Man (TASM) Franchise

And let's not forget the whole TASM franchise. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" had set such a promising tone. It was grittier and more grounded, which I personally loved

. The first TASM movie is actually my favorite Spider-Man film. However, the franchise was cut short not just because of poor critical reception but also due to the studio's incessant meddling. They were so focused on setting up a cinematic universe to compete with the MCU that they forgot to create a solid standalone sequel. TASM 2's failure was a huge letdown and eventually led to the character's reboot in the MCU.

# Other Notable Mentions

While these Spider-Man films are clear examples, they’re not alone. Studio interference has plagued many other movies:

* **Justice League (2017)**: The theatrical cut suffered from a jarring shift in tone and incomplete story arcs due to the studio’s decision to replace Zack Snyder with Joss Whedon and impose a strict runtime.
* **Fantastic Four (2015)**: Behind-the-scenes clashes and last-minute changes resulted in a disjointed and poorly received movie that didn’t do the iconic team justice.
* **Suicide Squad (2016)**: The final product felt like a mismatched medley of reshoots and edits aimed at making the film more lighthearted and marketable, straying from David Ayer’s original, darker vision.

# Conclusion

It’s frustrating to see how potential blockbusters can be derailed by studio decisions aimed at maximizing profits or establishing franchise potential. Often, these decisions lead to convoluted plots and underdeveloped characters, alienating fans and critics alike. I’d love to hear your thoughts and other examples of movies that were ruined by studio meddling.

What are some films you think suffered the most from studio interference? Let’s discuss!",0,10,1715935723.0,2024-05-17 09:48:43,False

venom2,venom 2,1amuhdh,Why do movies these days all have swearing and hardcore violence in them? I miss PGs.,"I dont go to nasty Rs, Im talking about PG13s and the lack of PGs, I dont mind once in a long while theres a movie that has a couple s-bombs but not so much, I just dont like to hear fuck and shit in every movie.  Oops I guess I need to watch my language, but its whats heard not a bleep.

We have these family movie outings all the time and just yesterday we went to Argylle, and there was a ton of s-bombs and gd-bombs the latter goes against one of the ten commandments;Thou Shall Not Say Heavenly Fathers Name In Vain which is what saying gawd**** is, plus one guy gets stabbed in the heart not super graphic.  Its not just this movie its all the recent movies that are so full of swearing and graphic deaths, we only go to this kinda movie when we dont have kids but being grown up it really sucks, it also sucks there are no Marvels or DCs this year those are the best ones, those swear sometimes but they hardly kill people too hard and throw in that schitty f-word which we heard in the first 2 Spidermans and Guardians 3, we do have a few of those non-MCU Spiderman horror movies which promise to be profane and ultra violent such as Madame Web and Venom 3, why cant most horror movies be like Scooby Doo Where Are You?  Zoinks!  Plus movies these days dont require one shit or headshot, like seriously there needs to be more PGs.
Constant language makes Argylle the worst movie, a Contra movie wouldnt talk like that.  Besides the bad stuff these movies are awesome but the language and hard kills are the only problem, I bet a Streets Of Rage movie wouldnt swear at all.",0,42,1707502045.0,2024-02-09 18:07:25,False

venom2,venom 2,1918ghq,"2024 is The Year of Sequels, Reboots, and Remakes","[Source](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/most-anticipated-movies-2024/mean-girls-4/)

The majority of Hollywood releases in 2024 will be a reboot, sequel, remake or otherwise based on existing IP or historical figures. I know this is frequently complained about, but I wanted to quantify it after looking at upcoming films this year. Has any other year had so many? 39/50 films

Many films originally due next year have now been pushed back to 2025 - including Tom Cruise's next Mission: Impossible, and Disney's live action Snow White.

That said, the year still has a significant range of big screen offerings, from Oscar hopefuls early in the year, to summer and autumn crowd-pleasing favourites.

So here are 24 films to look out for in 2024.

1. One Life
2. Poor Things
3. Mean Girls
4. The Holdovers
5. All of us are Strangers
6. The Color Purple

venom2,venom 2,18b2y10,How has your taste in movie genres and feeling towards the character archetype in stories changed as you grew older? What has surprisingly stayed the same?,"As I grew older, I'm tending to enjoy more dark or morally gray storyline and characters. As a kid, I enjoyed pure protagonists and heroes with a clear ending like many. However, now I enjoy it when the bad guy wins or stories with a troubled hero or a villain with nuance.

Now, I absolutely hate ""pure"" protagonists with no character flaws like Ray in SW and even OG Luke and Superman stories.

I even find Batman hit or miss (I do enjoy the latest Batman though).

Venom, for example, and the characters of Flash Thompson and Eddie Brock I now sympathize with in relation to superheroes/antiheroes. I kinda understand current movie, comic Eddie Brock and his struggles as I do Jason Todd. 

I am also able to enjoy the stories of some horror movies now, a genre I never touched as a child, teen, and YA. I kinda like the supernatural stuff with logical or supernatural explanations.

I quite enjoy the shift to darker tone media in the past years with The Boys, Invincible, Black Mirror, etc.

However, one thing remains the same. I hate Michelle Rodriguez and actors/actresses that portray 1 character type in every movie. As a kid/teen. After 2 movies of Michelle Rodriguez (Resident evil and a Fast movie), every movie she's been in is ruined imo. I just wished people like her play a different character. Or maybe I just hate the character Archetype. 

On the opposite end of the spectrum, I like many love Keanu, but that's a popular opinion. Another actor I adore from childhood to now is Clancy Brown. Dude can fucking act in all movies and Tv shows. He was GREAT in Punisher, John Wick 4, Dexter (if you ignore the last 2 episodes, just don't watch them), Starship Troopers and he plays fucking Mr. Krabs. I want him in every movie, and Jon Hamm. I feel like Him, Jon Hamm, and Keanu Reeves has this sort of gruff voice that is PERFECt for one liners. ""Yea"".",16,21,1701747986.0,2023-12-05 03:46:26,False

venom2,venom 2,13k3moy,"Astraverse – The concept on which Brahmastra is based is not just illogical, but ludicrously shameful","Excerpts from an online article-

खड्‌गं चक्र-गदेषु-चाप-परिघाञ्छूलं भुशुण्डीं शिर: शंखं:
This is a part of a Devi Stuti which was sang by Brahma ji for the first time. It means “Devi has in her 10 hands – Khadga, Chakra, Gada, Baan, Dhanush, Parigh, Shool, Bhushundi, a severed head and Shankha.” Let us try and understand these weapons.

Khadga means sword. It’s a close range hand to hand combat weapon.

Chakra means spiked discus. It’s a long range weapon which is normally projected on to a targets

Gada means mace: It’s again close range hand to hand combat weapon.

Baan means arrow: It’s a long range weapon which is normally shot on to a target

Dhanush means Bow and it is used to shoot arrows
Parigh is a special mace: It’s a close range weapon too, used in hand to hand fight.

Shool means spear: it can be used as a close range as well as a projectile. Trishul is a type of Shool.

Bhushundi is a type of catapult: It’s a long range weapon

Severed head is not a weapon but it’s supposed to instill fear in the hearts of foes.

Shankha is not a weapon, it is blown to mark the start and end of a battle day, it is also blown when a Rathi/Maharathi or Atirathi goes down in a battle.

This excerpt of Devi mantra is perhaps the best way to understand Astra, Shastra and other concepts of ancient Indian “aayudh”.

Out of the 10, 1,3 and 6 are Shashtras. 2,4,5 and 8 are Astras. 9 and 10 are not weapons. And 7 is both an Astra and a Shashtra. Simply put, Shashtras need to be held (although there is a class of Mukta, muktāmukta that can be thrown as well but let us not get into it) while fighting and Astras need to be used as projectiles and/or projection systems.

For the sake of simplicity let us only focus on Baan (arrows).

The simplest baan is a Naarach (an arrow with a pointed iron head). Most of the arrows shot in any battle were Naarach. In the hands of a skilled bowman, Naaraches can be super deadly, for instance Bhagwan Shri Ram killed Khar, Dooshan, Trishira and their army of 14000 Rakshasas using only Naaraches (that too in 72 minutes flat. Woah!! Jai Shri Ram)

Then there were Divine Baans or Divyastras. These were invoked using Mantras. The launch codes of modern day nukes can be taken as an example to understand the concept of Divyastras. Some of the most potent Divyastras were:

Agneyastra: this Astra used to rain fire on enemy lines
Parjanyastra: this Astra used to inundate enemy lines with torrential rain's

Vayavyaastra: this Astra used to blow away enemies with devastating wind's

Pannagastra: this Astra used to rain venomous snakes on enemy line's

Garudarastra: This Astra was the Antidote of Pannagastra as snakes used to run away at the mere sight of Pakshiraj Garuda

Brahmastra: The Astra of Brahma. This Astra was achook (won’t miss the target). It was not Akaatya (can’t be neutralized). It could be stopped with another Brahmastra which would lead to widespread destruction.

Narayanastra: The Astra of Narayan. It was both Achook and Akaatya. Once fired, it had the power to destroy almost every single soul on the planet.

Pashupatastra: The Astra of Mahadeva. It was both Achook and Akaatya. Once fired, it had the power to annihilate the whole planet.

Very few archers in India’s ancient history have possessed the last 3 Astras.

Divyastras were not weapons made of special material, their specialty lied in their way of invocation and the degree of damage they caused. Hence, they were virtually theft proof.

Now let’s come to the movie and this ludicrous concept called Astraverse. The cool term has been borrowed from Hollywood who have their DCVerse (Universe with Justice League Superheroes) and Marvelverse (Universe with Avengers superheroes). Astraverse simply put, means a universe of Astras. Bleh! It didn’t even exist in Ramayana or Mahabharata period. Arrows resided in the quivers of Dhanurdhars and Divyastras inside their minds.

Brahmastra’s main plot point is that a secret society of intellectuals guard Astras from falling in the hands of evil people. Brahmastra is the foremost among Astras and Ranbeer Kapoor (who plays Rumi now known as Shiva) is a weapon himself.

There are mentions of Astras like Vanarastra which has powers of Hanuman ji? And Nandiastra which has powers of Bhagwan Shankar’s mount Nandi the bull.

Nothing called Vanarastra has ever been mentioned in any text and it’s super bizarre to even think of something like this. 

Nandiastra is again a ridiculous concept. First some grammar lesson. नंदी ends with ई and अस्त्र begins with अ. So ई/इ + अ is not अ, it’s य् + अ, for instance यदि + अपि = यद्यपि. It’s यण संधि part of स्वर संधि method. So नंदी+अस्त्र should be नन्द्यासत्र and not नंदीअस्त्र. And just like Vanarastra, nothing called Nandiastra has ever been mentioned in any text and it’s super bizarre to even think of something like this. Also, Nandishwar ji is not supposed to be thrown on to enemies.

If Ranbir Kapoor is playing the role of a suicide bomber, then it is justified to call him an Astra (actually self-guided Shashtra), in any other case it is plain stupidity.

Also, Brahmastra has been referred to as Sikandar of Astras. I have no ideas how Alexander is related to Divyastras but I am assuming he has been used to refer to Brahmastra as the king of Astras. Well, it is not. There is no Kingdom of Astras and Brahmastra is a lot less powerful than Narayanastra and Pashupatastra. And again, Alexander really?

All in all, Karan Johar’s magnum opus Brahmastra has nothing to do with ancient India’s weaponry. It treats Divyastras as purely physical objects and at times as humans, both of which are ridiculous concepts.",0,0,1684334339.0,2023-05-17 15:38:59,False

Where do I begin?

I've only seen Rocky, Creed, Creed 2, and bits and pieces of Rocky 4

I've only seen the first Lethal Weapon and Predator (Though changing that tonight by watching Prey)

Of the Robocop movies, I've only seen the first one not the sequels or the remake

I've sat through Jurassic Park, Jurassic Park 3, and Jurassic World; started watching Jurassic Park 2 once but didn't finish it and I didn't see either of the Jurassic World sequels

I only saw Shrek 1, 2, and I put both Holiday specials on in the background while I was doing something else

I only watched the first 2 Ice Age movies

I've seen The Land Before Time but none of the 15 sequels it has

I only bothered with the first Venom not the sequel or Morbius (If the Spider-Man villain movies count as their own franchise)

I only watched the first X-Men movie and Deadpool and Deadpool 2 if they count as X-Men movies

And, of the James Bond movies, the only one I remember watching is Casino Royale though I swear I saw another one I just forget which one it is",0,25,1661347879.0,2022-08-24 14:31:19,False

venom2,venom 2,v7sltj,Nostalgia blostalgia – What happened to the Box Office leaders varying in genre (and sometimes even being targeted for Adults),"As a 1990 kid, I have a strong tendency to look backwards in movie history as opposed to forwards.

 

Personally – and I’m sure this is me being “old” that films, at least popular films, used to be more varied when it comes to genre and feel.  Nowadays, it feels like it all conglomerated into the lowest common denominator (MCU/Nostalgia cash grabs). So I checked it out. 

In an attempt to possibly see when and where this went wrong, below are the top 5 grossing films of each year from 88 – present. I chose this time period even though my favorite films of all time aren’t in it (Animal house, Alien, Raiders of the lost arc) because its easier and it’s a snapshot of my life through popular film.

 

From 17-22 of the top 5 movies (25 spots total) – In the last 5 years – Every single top 5 box office film was either a Super hero movie or a Cash grab on nostalgia that was either a remake or a sequel on something from 20+ years ago…  with the exception of fast and furious films or children’s movies.

 

Compare that to 88-92 you have at least 11 films that were not designed for kids and weren’t sequels… and those sequels at were not nostalgia grabs…  and the ones designed for kids were mostly live action…  like Home Alone - and in 93 – you have 4 films not designed for kids and Mrs. Doubtfire…

 

Ofc – Box office gross isn’t always the best measure of if a film is good or not… just if its popular… For EX, My favorite movies, including Die Hard, aren’t listed here. Specifically, stuff like The Bird Cage and the Judd Apatow/Todd Phillips (minus the hangover 2) films I grew up peeing my pants over just barely missed the top 5… Total Recall too - and office space is no where near it (not to mention 12 monkeys, the 5th element etc… and movies like Thoroughbreds and Ex Machina that will never gross this much)

 

However – I think you can still see the difference in what’s popular and also what got made/pushed through the list.

 

My big takeaway is that there have always been IP, Kids films, and major Block buster films, but somewhere around 2001 studios, and I guess the masses, started really pushing for what we see today, Superheroes, and Kids movies.... And nostalgia cash grabs.

 

You’ll notice that there were a lot more films designed for adults (like my mother, not like the 45 year old arrested dev elopement kid) and more varied genres making their way to the top 5… most notably comedies and rom coms.

 

I’m wondering what you all think has caused this shift and what you all make of it.

venom2,venom 2,ubv4kn,"Remember ""Bloodshot""? That one with Vin Diesel","I just realized how actually bad that movie is.

The only two good things that were there are the main villain, played by wonderful Guy Pearce, and the ""Psycho Killer"" song. 

When I first watched the movie, I was like ""Meh"". But then I found out, that the movie is based on a comic. I bought it, read it, and I have the same question as the one I have to Sony for both ""Venom"" movies - HOW COULD YOU WASTE THAT KIND OF MATERIAL?!

Talking about ""Bloodshot"" - the comic is R-rated, so it's DEFINITELY not kid-friendly, so the PG-13 rating just destroys 2/3 of fun (just fyi - there is a moment in the comic when Bloodshot gets completely destroyed by the minigun from the helicopter. With A LOT of gore). And in the comic the nanites, that Bloodshot has inside him, work on pure protein, so he has to eat raw meat (there is a moment in the comic where he tears a living cow apart. Off panel of course, but we understand what he did). 

The situation with Venom is almost the same - Sony tried to make him kid-friendly and failed (but somehow got billions of dollars from each movie). 

I think that those kinds of movies should not be made. I mean those that pose like a screen adaptation, but have nothing to do with the original besides the title, and are made just for money grab",7,15,1650919758.0,2022-04-25 21:49:18,False
venom2,venom 2,u6bm3r,Why did Sony (while trying to make their cinematic universe) hire writers that had poor previous works?,"Why so studios hire obviously bad (at least at that moment) writers and directors to direct their movies that their future potential CU hinges on?  I can get why you would hire random director for Pixels movie or whatever, but you just had SMan earn 2.billions, you have Venom making money and you have somewhat a good shot at actually making a Sonyverse with no Spidey and you get bad writers and dorectors.... I just dont get it. Give 10 millions to the best writers in business, give the money to great directors, actually put in the effort to make it, dont just get first random guy to make your movie. 


MCU took risks because they had nothing to lose and subsequently when they did make risks with Gunn and Russo's, they already had a machine that makes 80% of a product and it doesnt really matter what director does as they cant fuck it up that much.",2,19,1650283720.0,2022-04-18 13:08:40,False
venom2,venom 2,tsmxd9,'Morbius' Review Thread,"[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/morbius): 16% (117 reviews) with 3.8 in average rating

> Critics consensus: Cursed with uninspired effects, rote performances, and a borderline nonsensical story, this Spidey-adjacent mess is a vein attempt to make Morbius happen.

[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/morbius): 37/100 (45 critics)

As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** 

> After a promising start, Daniel Espinosa’s long-delayed film only intermittently matches the intensity of the lead performance, and the script by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless becomes thin on story, stringing together chaotic outbursts and action clashes that build to a painstakingly foreshadowed “sibling” faceoff. None of that seems likely to deter the geek faithful, even if this new entry in Sony’s Spider-Man Universe often seems a lot like a boilerplate Venom installment, without the humor.

-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/morbius-jared-leto-1235122778/)

> “Morbius” mostly surprises because of how very dull it is. Case in point: After Michael’s bad deeds become publicized, local news teams term him “the Vampire Murderer,” an uninspired nickname that serves as a microcosm of everything “Morbius” is: mostly unnecessary, oddly unoriginal, and soon quite forgettable indeed.

-[Kate Erbland, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/2022/03/morbius-review-jared-leto-1234712158/): C-

> “Morbius” isn’t even a debacle. It’s a little over 90 minutes long if you don’t count the credits (which include what has to be the worst closing teaser I’ve ever seen in a Marvel movie), and for all the overwrought push of Jon Ekstrand’s score, the film is nothing more than a flimsy time-killer, an early-April placeholder of a movie. It’s as trashy and underimagined as the “Venom” films, though it’s easy to see why both of those became mega-hits: The character of Venom, who’s like a superhero merged with the creature from “Alien,” with a voice of basso showbiz effrontery, is an entertaining hunk of sci-fi demon eye candy. Whereas Leto’s teeth-baring monster-scientist truly looks like a relic from the ’70s. He never scares or dazzles or haunts you — not because Leto is less than a good actor, but because this isn’t a character based on acting. It’s based on the creakiest FX, the one (mild) exception being the painterly trails of digital “smoke” left behind by Morbius as he flies through the air.

-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2022/film/reviews/morbius-review-jared-leto-1235217960/)

> Morbius is unspectacular in ways that waste the potential of what could be an intriguing hybrid of sinister horror and superhero thrills. One single scene recalls David F. Sandberg’s Lights Out for a suitable fright, but otherwise horror accents are limited to cheesy jokes about Dracula. That’s the approach the whole film takes, in fact. Everything feels superfluous and uninterested in thoughtful storytelling because the mission at hand is to get to the end credits where the meat exists. Morbius is so focused on building Sony’s Spider-Man Universe and hopeful sequels — which could very well be better now that the foundation exists — that it forgets about enthusiastically engaging its audience from the start.

-[Matt Donato, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/morbius-review): 5.0 ""mediocre""

> What starts as a fun mad-scientist saga ends up in the usual big battle, and the journey drags along the way.

-[Alonso Duralde, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/morbius-film-review-jared-leto-matt-smith-marvel-spider-man/)

> It really is an amazingly pointless and dumb film: the good/bad setup between Morbius and Milo is muddled and cancelled by the not-especially-compelling moral struggle within Morbius himself. Both Leto and Smith have to keep doing the evil demonic face-change growling thing, and it is intensely silly. Let’s hope the extended Spider-Man universe extends far enough to include something more interesting than this.

-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/31/morbius-review-ludicrously-pointless-jekyll-and-hyde-vampire-monster-yarn): 1/5

> Most of the MCU movies and some of the recent DC films like “The Suicide Squad” are case studies on how to best introduce obscure superhero personas onto the screen. The gonzo “Venom” movies know and proudly own what they are. “Morbius” misses all those lessons and seems to be stuck among the more lackluster films from the early to mid 2000s a la “Elektra.” Even the mid-credits scenes that attempt to bring Leto’s role into a larger landscape wind up being more confusing than cool. Rather than a fang-tastic time, “Morbius” is just a soul-sucking effort.

-[Brian Truitt, USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/03/31/morbius-review-jared-leto-marvel-introduction-lifeless-slog/7223329001/): 1.5/4

> Beyond whatever scenes have been reworked, recut or just plain deleted from an abbreviated final cut, the movie shies away from the vampirism that could have made this more than a swift origin story: There’s surprisingly little blood in this sucker and, of course, eroticism is largely eschewed. The movie is most enticing when Dr. Michael Morbius feels like a threat to himself and/or others, and that feeling isn’t allowed to linger. It’s a perverse tactic, given that Sony transparently yearns for these villains to team up and take on some version, any version, of Spider-Man. The actual pre-credits body of Morbius doesn’t actually waste any time on this set-up. Yet there’s some kind of invisible force here, hurrying things along in the hopes of a future team-up, making sure this feature film arrives more undead than alive.

-[Jesse Hassenger, Paste Magazine](https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/morbius-review/): 5.9/10

> Without spoiling anything, a couple of post-credits sequences set up a future for Leto’s character in a larger world that you understand why Sony would try and telegraph, but given the failures of past Spider-Man spin-offs it’s hard to believe they have really thought any of those next steps through. But until then, Morbius feels like exactly the kind of second-tier superhero adventure audiences will accept in between ones that they actively want. Admittedly, it’s odd to want a movie like this to have been worse, but that would mean it failed as bigly as the swings it took; by comparison, Morbius is a walk, or at best a bunt. That may qualify it as a hit for Leto, Espinoza and Sony, but that doesn’t mean it’s much fun to watch from the stands.

-[Todd Gilchrist, The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/morbius-review-jared-leto-matt-smith-adria-arjona-spide-1848729603): C-

> “Morbius” is bad, yes, but it’s not even fun-bad, like the “Venom” movies; it’s just kind of depressing. There’s not a single thrilling, surprising, or entertaining moment in it, from start to finish, because comic book movies have reached a point of longevity and saturation that all of them are purely paint-by-number affairs: the laborious origin stories, the washed-out color palates, the bombastic scores, the daddy issues, the climactic barely-lit, CGI-heavy final fights to the death, and the mid-credit sequences to set up future installments. The nicest thing I can say about it is that it’s short.

-[Jason Bailey, The Playlist](https://theplaylist.net/morbius-review-dull-depressing-comic-book-horror-hybrid-20220330/): D-

> It looks like “Morbius” might soon cross paths with Spider-Man in one universe or another, but that would be a big step up for him, because his introductory vehicle feels more like a just-average 1990s vampire movie.

-[Richard Roeper, The Chicago Sun Times](https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2022/3/30/23003641/morbius-review-marvel-movie-jared-leto-matt-smith): 2/4

> Is Morbius the worst Marvel movie ever made? In an alternate universe without The New Mutants, the answer would likely be yes. And with all these multiverses now colliding into each other, who knows: There may even be a world out there where things actually came together for this old-school comic-book bloodsucker onscreen, where his determination to fight his newly monstrous nature while taking on the corrupt and the criminal gave us a deeper, darker antihero and Leto the chance to make his mark in the larger Marvel ecosphere. We’re stuck in this timeline, where the Morbius we’ve got is, plain and simple, a mess. If it’s not the worst of these films, it’s certainly the most anemic — and even die-hard fans are apt to feel completely drained by all of it.

Aside from the fact that Spider-Man has now been part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe since 2015, a franchise I dislike, they made things worse for me with NO WAY HOME because they brought Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and most of their villains into the MCU and (hopefully I’m wrong) retconned their deaths in their movies.

venom2,venom 2,su73n5,The Fourth Annual One-Shot Oscars!,"This was the year big a-list movies that should have been released in 2020 actually *were* released, so there’s no glut of worthy for visual effects! On the other hands, there was only a ten-month window for release, and I think purely streaming films weren’t eligible.

But once again there’s no shortage of quality choices, just hard judgement calls. (Note: will probably have to edit this at least once due to eagle-eyed readers finding the same movie twice.)

venom2,venom 2,sa7f18,The 1st Moonlight Awards - Highlighting the Best of 2021 Film,"Hello and welcome to the 1st Annual Moonlight Awards, named for my favourite Best Picture-winning film, where I will give awards according to my totally unqualified but passionate opinions! I'm hoping to use this post to recommend my favourite films of the year and open a discussion in the comments about any films you would like to highlight.

**TL;DR AT END**

First I'd like to point out some acclaimed 2021 films I haven't seen since they are not eligible for any categories for that reason: The Eyes of Tammy Faye, Parallel Mothers, Belle, The Harder They Fall, The Hand of God, Benedetta, Bergman Island, Ron's Gone Wrong, The Souvenir Part II, The Worst Person in the World and The Tender Bar. All films released in 2021 awards cycle that I've seen are eligible. (Here is the full list of everything I've seen: https://boxd.it/b6hrU) 

Without further ado, let's give out some meaningless but fun awards.

1. First up tonight is the award for **Best Breakthrough Talent**. This award recognises anyone behind the camera who reached new creative heights this year. 

And the nominees are:

*Zach Baylin* as writer of King Richard

*David Charbonier and Justin Powell* as directors and writers of The Boy Behind the Door and The Djinn

*Lauren Hadaway* as director, writer and editor of The Novice. 

*Rebecca Hall* as director, writer and producer of Passing

*Fran Kranz* as director, writer and producer of Mass

and

*Natalie Morales* as director, writer and producer of Language Lessons. 

And the Mooney goes to... **Fran Kranz**! For a first time creative, Kranz makes a bold and convincing film out of a tough theme. 

2. Next, we honour talent who made a fresh impression in front of the camera with the award for **Best Breakthrough Star**. 

The nominees are:

*Jodie Comer* in Free Guy, Help and The Last Duel 

*Isabelle Fuhrman* in The Novice

*Stephen Graham* in Boiling Point, Greyhound, Help and Venom: Let There Be Carnage

*Alana Haim* in Licorice Pizza

*Emilia Jones* in CODA

and 

*Anthony Ramos* for In The Heights. 

And the Mooney goes to... **Jodie Comer**! Those of us who have followed her TV career already knew that Comer was capable of giving a great performance, but this year she showed a new level of versatility on the big screen. 

3. Now for the award for **Best Production in a Feature Film**. This category is a supersized amalgation of all the technical awards to avoid this post becoming too repetitive. Four creative strong points are highlighted for each nominee. 

The nominees are:

*Annette* for achievements in production design, score, song and visual effects. 

*Cruella* for achievements in costuming, make-up & hair, production design and song. 

*Dune* for achievements in editing, production design, score and visual effects. 

*The French Dispatch* for achievements in cinematography, editing, make-up & hair and production design. 

*In The Heights* for achievements in choreography, cinematography, costuming and stunts. 

*The Last Duel* for achievements in editing, sound, stunts and visual effects. 

*Spencer* for achievements in cinematography, costuming, make-up & hair and score. 

*Spider-man: No Way Home* for achievements in editing, sound, stunts and visual effects. 

*The Suicide Squad* for achievements in costuming, production design, stunts and visual effects. 

*Wide Side Story* for achievements in choreography, editing, production design and score. 

And the Mooney goes to... *Wide Side Story*. Every aspect of this production was firing on all cylinders. 

4. Next, the award for **Best Supporting Actress in a Feature Film**. 

The nominees are... 

*Jessie Buckley* in The Lost Daughter 

*Ariana DeBose* in West Side Story

*Ann Dowd* in Mass

*Marlee Matlin* in CODA

*Ruth Negga* in Passing

and 

*Martha Plimpton* in Mass. 

And the Mooney goes to... **Ruth Negga** for a performance filled with equal measures of glamorous poise and heart-breaking vulnerability. 

5. Now for the award for **Best Supporting Actor in a Feature Film**. 

The nominees are:

*Bradley Cooper* in Licorice Pizza

*Daniel Durant* in CODA

*Mike Faist* in West Side Story

*Jason Isaacs* in Mass

*Troy Kotsur* in CODA

and

*Vincent Lindon* in Titane. 

And the Mooney goes to... **Vincent Lindon**! It took me two viewings to appreciate the depths of Lindon's performance but along with Agatha Rouselle, he forms the emotional core of this stunning film.

6. Next up, the award for **Best International Feature Film**! 

The nominees are:  

From Denmark, ""Flee"" 

From France, *Titane*

From France, *Petite Maman*

From Iran, *A Hero*

From Romania, *Bad Luck Banging*

and

From the State of Palestine, *It Must Be Heaven*. 

And the Mooney goes to... **It Must Be Heaven**! Elia Suleiman's evocative globe-trotting docudrama explores Palestine's place in the world with humour and profundity. 

7. And now the award for **Best Documentary Feature**. 

The nominees are: 

*Billie Eilish: The World's A Little Blurry*

*Flee*

*Introducing Selma Blair*

*The Reason I Jump*

*The Rescue*

and

*Summer of Soul*. 

And the Mooney goes to... **Introducing Selma Blair**! This documentary didn't get much attention upon its Discovery+ release but this intimate and inspiring look at Blair's battle with MS is heartbreaking then beautifully uplifting. 

8. And now the award for **Best Animated Feature**. 

The nominees are:

*Flee*

*Mitchells vs the Machines*

and

*Raya and the Last Dragon*. 

And the Mooney goes to... **Raya and the Last Dragon**! Epic in scope and ambition, Raya succeeds in impressing you with both its visual scale and emotional stakes. 

9. Now onto our next award: **Best Actress in a Feature Film**. 

The nominees are:

*Olivia Colman* in The Lost Daughter 

*Isabelle Fuhrman* in The Novice

*Alana Haim* in Licorice Pizza

*Rebecca Hall* in The Night House

*Kristen Stewart* in Spencer

and 

*Rachel Zegler* in West Side Story. 

All of these actresses gave stunning, career-best performances but only one can win. Such was the strength of this year's field that in any other year, Jodie Comer, Jennifer Hudson, Emilia Jones and Agatha Rouselle would surely be nominated also. 

And the Mooney goes to... **Kristen Stewart**! I'm sure many of us were surprised and skeptical of the casting of Stewart as Princess Diana but she proved us all wrong with a superbly nuanced piece of work that never crossed the line into mere impersonation. 

10. Next up, **Best Actor in a Feature Film**. 

The nominees are:

*Bradley Cooper* in Nightmare Alley

*Andrew Garfield* in Tick, Tick, Boom! 

*Amir Jadidi* in A Hero

*Caleb Landry Jones* in Nitram

*Joaquin Phoenix* in C'Mon C'Mon

and

*Will Smith* in King Richard. 

And the Mooney for Best Actor goes to... **Caleb Landry Jones**! Amongst a strong crop of contenders, Jones gave a chilling and effective performance complete with a pitch perfect Australian accent. 

11. It's time to present the next award, **Best Screenplay for a Feature Film**! 

The nominees are: 

*Elena Ferrante and Maggie Gyllenhaal* for The Lost Daughter

*Rebecca Hall and Nella Larson* for Passing

*Sian Heder* for CODA

*Fran Kranz* for Mass

*Mike Mills* for C’mon C’mon

and 

*Celine Sciamma* for Petite Maman. 

And the Mooney goes to... **Mike Mills**! Subtle and moving, C’mon C’mon succeeds due to Mills' skilful empathetic script. 

12. Next, the award for **Best Director of a Feature Film**. 

The nominees are:

*Paul Thomas Anderson* for Licorice Pizza

*Julia Ducournau* for Titane

*Pablo Larrain* for Spencer

*Edson Oda* for Nine Days

*Steven Spielberg* for West Side Story

and

*Denis Villeneuve* for Dune. 

And the Mooney goes to... **Julia Ducournau**. Ducournau is a visionary and with Titane, she offers a once-in-a-lifetime mix of stunning visuals, bold storytelling and powerful themes. 

13. Now for one of the most prestigious awards, **Best Ensemble in a Feature Film**. 

The nominees are:

*Eugenio Derbez, Daniel Durant, Amy Forsyth, Emilia Jones, Troy Kotsur, Marlee Matlin and Ferdia Walsh-Peelo* for CODA

*Jessie Buckley, Olivia Colman, Dagmara Dominczyk, Jack Farthing, Ed Harris, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Dakota Johnson, Paul Mescal, Alba Rohrwacher and Peter Saarsgard* for The Lost Daughter 

*Reed Birney, Ann Dowd, Jason Isaacs, Martha Plimpton and Breeda Wool* for Mass

*Essie Davis, Judy Davis, Sean Keenan, Anthony LaPaglia and Caleb Landry Jones* for Nitram

*Eve Austin, Kate Dickie, Tallulah Grieve, Abigail Lawrie, Sally Messham, Rona Morison and Marli Siu* for Our Ladies

and

*David Alvarez, Brian d'Arcy James, Ariana Debose, Mike Faist, Ezra Menas, Rita Moreno, Josh Andres Rivera, Rachel Zegler and Maddie Ziegler* for West Side Story. 

And the Mooney goes to... **The Cast of *The Lost Daughter***! An enigmatic and nuanced set of portrayals of difficult roles shines through as the highlight of the film. 

14. And now for our final award of the night, **Best Feature Film**.

The nominees are:

*C'Mon C'Mon*

*CODA*

*The Last Duel*

*Licorice Pizza*

*Mass*

*The Night House*

*Our Ladies*

*Spencer*

*Titane*

and

*West Side Story*. 

And the Mooney goes to... **Titane**! Julia Ducournau truly made the most original and thrilling movie of the year. She is the most exciting voice in film at the moment and I can't wait to see what she does next.

Given that the 2 movies were released in a post-Deadpool world, it would've been cool if Sony were to compete with Fox in terms of having R-rated solo movies comic book anti-heroes since, as I said, an R-rated Venom and Carnage would've been really cool",3,25,1642041662.0,2022-01-13 02:41:02,False

venom2,venom sequel,1ioj005,Anyone else think one of the biggest issues with non-shared universe franchises is that they are very redundant?,"This is something I've been thinking about and noticed recently. Almost all of the franchise that aren't shared universe all seem to very derivative or repetitive.

Look at the Alien and Predator franchise, both have an expansive lore in their expanded universes in the comics, games, etc that go into the history of both the xenomorph and yautja, following individual members to specific points in time. Aliens has stories about how other races will fight and even harvest the xenos for their own use, we learn that they are actually very low on the food chain on their planet, see different subspecies of the xenos. For the Predator, we have tales of rebellion against a slave driving race that shaped their culture into hunter-warriors, we learn more about their honor code and daily lives, we have tales of redemption following individual hunters... And yet the movies are all the same stuff: Alien is just a bunch of halfwits being chased around a spaceship by an acid bug and the Predator movies are just mostly people running around the wilderness being chased by an alien.

Terminator is the same, Salvation tried to expand on the mythos by setting it DURING the human-skynet war, but that was walked for two derivative sequels. And let's not forget Jurassic Park. Dominion ended with dinosaurs in the modern world and it opened up a lot of potential new stories (2015's Backcountry with parasitic troodons, anybody?), but they literally kill off all the dinosaurs on a global scale JUST so we can have another movie about people going to a dinosaur island for the sixth time in this SEVEN movie franchise!

I know people were divided on Zack Snyder's Superman, but I actually like the original idea: a RE-construction of the character who has to EARN his status as the symbol of hope over the course of multiple films instead of just BEING one already. My favorite Superman story has a similar plot to this, and would love to have seen this come to full fruition... James Gunn's Superman looks to be doing the opposite, and just trying to also be in line with those prior Superman's, especially the Richard Donner movies, instead of something refreshingly different. I know that it's shaping up to be a tale about Superman's position s a symbol of hope in modern society being questioned, but that plot really does sound much better as a PART 3 than it does a PART 1.

Look at King Kong, ignoring the Monsterverse, half his filmography is literally retellings of the first movie: 1933, KKvG, Escapes, 1976, Mighty Kong, 2005, etc. Even most of the unmade movies are just rehashes or retellings, and the only continuity any cares about is just once again, a retelling that traps its worldbuilding within the rules of the 1932 public domain novelization. It wasn't until the Monsterverse came along and took notes from Godzilla of all characters, that King Kong actually became a character worth paying attention too; he now has a rogue's gallery that isn't just giant animals, he has allies, he has a consistently moving story over multiple movies, his mythos is being expanded in ways that is both interesting and fun, he's not just a big gorilla doomed to fall from grace (literally) again and again.

Speaking of which, I'm a Godzilla, and I can tell you strongest part of the franchise is it's wide variety of tones and storytelling; there is literally a Godzilla for everyone of every genre, and this is what allowed it last as long as it did. Same with Batman, though the live action adaptations look to be permanently sticking to Christopher Nolan's style, we still have films with the character being released with varying tones (Merry Little Batman was released two years after The Batman, and the former will be followed by Batman Ninja 2, two years later). Same with James Bond, the Ninja Turtles, and the plethora of public domain characters. If they were all portrayed the same again and again with a similar story, nobody would care because nothing new is being added or done. EVEN VENOM, though flawed, those movies do something different, something that wouldn't be possible if it was tied to the MCU.

And yet, for the most part, I only hear people say they want stuff to be like the original or whatnot; being The4thSnake constantly blustering about how NRS doesn't make new Mortal Kombat games the same way Midway did, the plethora of ""fans"" who want Godzilla Minus One to be the main inspiration going forward, people who want every single Marvel movie to be in the MCU and not just have Marvel movies separate and do their own thing, etc.

Am I crazy for not wanting everything to be derivative of prior works in their respective franchises, and would rather have every film or sequel be different?",0,17,1739453225.0,2025-02-13 13:27:05,False
venom2,venom sequel,1i0w6jg,"January 10-12 Box Office Recap: 'Den of Thieves 2' takes the #1 spot from 'Mufasa' and 'Sonic', debuting with $15 million domestically. However, 'Better Man' massively flopped in its wide expansion, debuting at #13 with a terrible $1 million from 1,291 theaters, against its $110 million budget.","https://preview.redd.it/wyyfpflzhvce1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e6b820d9a6c3bcf91bab0d1448e8d898d5716f5

Turns out the kingdom didn't last long.

Whether it was a surprise or not, ***Den of Thieves 2: Pantera*** managed to dethrone ***Mufasa: The Lion King*** for the top spot at the box office. In some very bad news, the wide expansion of ***Better Man*** was a complete disaster, finishing outside the Top 10.

The Top 10 earned a combined $69.6 million this weekend. That's down 16.8% from last year, when ***Mean Girls*** and ***The Beekeeper*** opened. Despite the current LA fires, the LA market still accounted for 8% of the weekend's gross, which is actually above the usual 7.9% in a normal weekend.

Debuting at #1, ***Den of Thieves 2: Pantera*** earned $15 million in 3,008 theaters. That's almost on par with the original ***Den of Thieves*** ($15.2 million). It's also the first Lionsgate film to hit #1 at the box office since ***The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes*** in 2023 (they've had a very bad run last year).

Even though it arrived 7 years later, clearly the interest was there for a ***Den of Thieves*** sequel. Compared to a lot of recent actions flicks with Gerard Butler, it has maintained that popularity thanks to home media and streaming. But these films corner the exact same market: the dad movie market. There's an audience who simply wants to watch an old-school action movie, and ***Den of Thieves*** delivers that (just like ***The Beekeeper*** did one year ago). The LA fires also didn't do much impact in its box office numbers; the LA market generated 10.4% of the film's box office, which is actually bigger than the original's 9.3% LA share.

According to Lionsgate, 63% of the audience was male. As mentioned, this was a dad movie; 79% of the audience was 25 and over, with 52% over 35. They gave it a ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is the same grade as the original. January looks quite weak, although it will have to compete with stuff like ***Wolf Man*** and ***Flight Risk*** in a few weeks. Nevertheless, it has enough gas to hit $40 million domestically.

The reign of ***Mufasa*** lasted just one weekend, as it had to go back to the second spot. The film dropped 39.4%, adding $14.2 million this weekend. The film has earned $188.7 million, which is a colossal 61% behind the 2019 film through the same point.

In third place, ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** dropped 46.8%, adding $11.3 million. With this, it has not only passed the second film's gross, but it also passed the $200 million milestone. It has earned $204.8 million so far, and it should finish with around $240 million domestically.

In fourth place, Focus Features' ***Nosferatu*** dropped 47.3%, adding $6.8 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to a fantastic $81.8 million, and it's still on pace to finish with over $100 million, assuming it's not killed by ***Wolf Man*** this weekend.

***Moana 2*** fell back to Earth after its holiday boost. It dropped 47.5%, earning $6.5 million this weekend. The film has amassed $434.8 million domestically.

Searchlight's ***A Complete Unknown*** eased 37.4%, adding $5.1 million this weekend. With this, the film has crossed $50 million domestically, although the dream of $100 million died.

***Wicked*** had a slightly rough drop. This time, it fell 48.7%, grossing $5.1 million this weekend. Nevertheless, it's not like Universal ain't hurtin'; the film has made $70 million in PVOD in its first week. The film has earned a fantastic $458 million so far.

In eighth place, A24's ***Babygirl*** is still holding very well despite the end of the holidays. The film eased just 30.6% (the best drop in the top 10), adding $3 million this weekend. The film has earned a damn good $21.7 million so far.

In ninth place, the Indian film ***Game Changer*** earned $2 million from just 805 theaters.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Roadside Attractions' ***The Last Showgirl***, which finally had its wide release after having a limited weekend run at a single theater last month. It debuted with a solid $1.5 million in 870 theaters. While it's set to expand it in to a few more theaters, don't expect it to hit $10 million.

A24 expanded ***The Brutalist*** to 68 theaters, coming off its big wins at the Golden Globes last week. The film grossed a pretty great $1.3 million, which is a very strong $20,408 per-theater average. So far, the film has earned $2.7 million. It will see another expansion this weekend, before finally hitting wide release the following weekend.

***Gladiator II*** fell 53.4%, adding $1.2 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $170.9 million.

We have to go all the way to the #13 spot to find the weekend's other expansion, Paramount's ***Better Man***, the Robbie Williams biopic. We knew it was not gonna break out, given that its limited release numbers were very poor. Yet the film managed to surprise us by going even lower.

***Better Man*** debuted in 1,291 theaters, and the film earned a terrible $1 million. Yep, you read that correctly. That's an anemic $824 per-theater average. Assuming that each theater played this five times a day at a regular $11.90 ticket price, that means that there were just 4 people in each screening. Woah. And to make things worse, the film cost $110 million. Now, Paramount is not deeply invested in here; they only picked the distribution rights to the film for $25 million. They won't lose a lot of money, but this will be another money loss for them.

The American market was never going crazy for a Robbie Williams biopic for a simple reason: they have no idea who Robbie Williams is. That's quite surprising, given that he's the one of the best-selling singers in history (75 million records sold puts him in the same vein as The Weeknd, Green Day, Oasis, Nirvana and Imagine Dragons). But despite his popularity across Europe, Oceania and Latin America, Williams never broke out in America. Only two of his songs made it in the Billboard Top 100 (""Angels"" and ""Millennium"") and they both peaked at #53 and #72. So despite selling out a lot of concerts and records, he's still a complete unknown in America.

There's also the decision that was supposed to be its selling point, but still drew a polarizing reaction. To separate itself from other biopics, the film decided to depict Williams as a CGI chimpanzee. Bonus points for originality, but that also confused the general audience. So the audience are left with two questions ""who is Robbie Williams?"" and ""why is he a chimpanzee?"" Instead of trying to find more or listen to a few songs from Williams, they simply chose to not watch it all. After all, a music biopic is aimed at big fans of a singer, so why would they pay for an artist they don't care about? Even with great reviews (88% on RT and 77 on Metacritic), that's not enough to make them change their mind.

According to Paramount, 56% of the audience was male, and 52% was 25 and over. Despite some great word of mouth (83% on PostTrak, 63% definite recommend), this is not a film that will leg out. It's not gonna hit $5 million domestically, and it's likely it could miss $3 million as well. We want to say it will be saved overseas, but the film has been disappointing in the UK and Australia so far. This is a flop.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Mufasa: The Lion King*** topped the box office with $27.8 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $542 million. The film's best markets are France ($33.7M), UK ($29.9M), Mexico ($24.6M), Germany ($24M) and Italy ($21.8M).

***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** added $20.3 million, as it's nearing $400 million worldwide. Most notably, it opened in China, where it flopped with only a little over $1 million. The film's best markets are UK ($25.9M), Mexico ($18.8M), France ($15.8M), Australia ($13.2M) and Brazil ($9.2M).

***Nosferatu*** added $13.7 million, taking its worldwide total to a fantastic $135.4 million. It's Robert Egger's highest grossing film by a wide margin, passing ***The Northman*** a long time ago. The best markets are the UK ($11.1M), Mexico ($6.03M), Italy ($4.3M), Germany ($3.5M) and Australia ($3.4M).

***Moana*** added $11.1 million, helping it reach $990 million worldwide. The film's best markets are France ($60.6M), UK ($49.7M), Germany ($41.7M), Mexico ($30.2M) and Australia ($29.5M). It's hitting the billion milestone sometime this week.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Venom: The Last Dance* | Oct/25 | Sony | $51,012,404 | $139,755,882 | $474,775,261 | $120M
*Y2K* | Dec/6 | A24 | $2,113,923 | $3,763,863 | $3,763,863 | $15M

- Sony's ***Venom: The Last Dance*** has closed with $474 million worldwide. Despite its poor reception and word of mouth (""B–"" on CinemaScore), the film benefitted from a lack of competition, as studios chose to avoid releasing anything close to the election. A success? Definitely. But the film still ended up making less money than ***Let There Be Carnage***, which was released in worse conditions and had no China grosses. Who knows what's the future for this character.

- A24's ***Y2K*** has closed with a very poor $3.7 million in North America, which is a very bad 1.78x multiplier. Despite Kyle Mooney's interest in filmmaking, the film struggled to balance its horror and comedy elements, but at the end of the day, the audience simply wasn't interested. Let's hope his next film is much better, if he ever gets the chance.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We find two newcomers this weekend.

The first, and perhaps the weekend's winner, is Universal/Blumhouse's ***Wolf Man***. The film is the latest addition in Universal's reboot of their Classic Monsters line-up, after the success of ***The Invisible Man*** (also written and directed by Leigh Whannell). Horror is a very reliable genre, so perhaps we might be looking at another winner here.

The other wide release is Sony's ***One of Them Days***, which stars Keke Palmer and SZA as two friends who seek to avoid eviction. In the current landscape, there's been very few comedies not tied to IPS, so this can be a good test to see the interest in R-rated comedies.

#**ANNOUNCEMENT**

As this weekend falls on the MLK weekend, the actuals will probably be delayed by a day. So the post will go up on Tuesday.

venom2,venom sequel,1hktwu8,"We went to the movies 54 times this year [2024], and here are my personal feelings about those films.","**Previous Years**

[2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18s4re1/we_went_to_the_movies_55_times_this_year_and_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  \-  [2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/zgw1vo/we_went_to_the_movies_39_times_this_year_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

This is now my third year doing something like this, and I really enjoyed talking to people last year about where my movies fell versus where they felt things needed to land. There were definitely a few criticisms last year that I'd like to clear up beforehand:

* I do view myself as a ""typical moviegoer"" and don't see myself as a cinephile at all.
* My wife and I tend to go during the weekends at daytime hours, it's just our preference, which does limit us sometimes with movies that aren't as popular and are in their 3rd-4th week of a run.
* There are a lot of movies we'd like to see but don't get around to just because a smaller release happens during a time where we're very busy and don't get to the theater for a few weeks.
* Many of you were critical of the fact that I often took small naps during movies - It never bothered me, but I did find out that I was vitamin D deficient early this year, and taking vitamins has helped out a lot
* This list does include movies from 2023 that I either saw at the beginning of 2024, or we saw in 2023 after releasing my list last year.

**A Quick Note on Categories:**

Other than ""Favorite of the Year"" I don't particularly have other categories ranked top to bottom in terms of favorite. There are movies in the ""Enjoyed it, but Probably Wouldn't Watch Again"" category that I liked better than movies in the ""Enjoyed it and Would Watch Again"" category, but I prefer fun and more relaxed movies for multiple viewings.

# Favorite of the Year [Ranked in Order]

* **My Old Ass:** I expected to like this one, as a comedy. . .But I came out of the theater with tears in my eyes. Yea sure it's about a drug induced romp \[on the surface\], but as I get older I feel this one really spoke to me on a deeper level.
* **We Live in Time:** I don't know if I'll ever watch it again. It doesn't strike me as the type of movie that I am going to want to watch a second time, just because of the subject nature and how deeply sad it is. . .But it moved me pretty significantly as is the second time I've ever found myself crying at a movie theater.
* **Lisa Frankenstein:** I was surprised to learn some people really hated this one, because I think it was the perfect amount of fun. . and weird. . .and campy.

# I Enjoyed it and Would Watch Again

* **Deadpool & Wolverine:** It's just a fun love letter of a movie, right? I don't go to a Deadpool movie expecting everything to make sense. I just want a good old fashioned 4th wall breaking bromance, and this movie delivers.
* **Saturday Night:** The movie has a very frenetic energy to it and didn't give me a lot of breathing room to process different things going on, which is something that I typically don't enjoy. For some reason \[maybe it's the fact that I do watch SNL and kind of have that expectation anyway\] it just works, and I'd probably want to watch it again to see what nuances I might pick up on.
* **Inside Out 2:** Inside Out 2 does a far better job \[in my opinion\] of being a fun Disney sequel than Moana 2 does. I think I'd need to watch both entries of this franchise back to back to really decide which one I like better.
* **Heretic:** I don't know if I ever thought I'd see Hugh Grant in a horror movie like this. It hits all the notes that I expect from the genre, but I really liked the Book of Mormon x Horror vibe, and the almost chess like mentality his villain hits throughout the entire movie.
* **Fly Me to the Moon:** We live in a time where people just make shit up, so even though this takes place before the moon landing, it still sort of felt topical. . .Except it's also a very funny comedy.
* **Speak No Evil:** I'm writing this after writing a few other similar thoughts further down the list - Once again, another movie that feels totally ruined by the trailers. . Why do they keep doing this to us? Except it honestly doesn't even matter. The movie just works. . I'd watch it 10 more times just to see if I pick up on anything in the background.

# Enjoyed Far More Than I Expected

* **Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes:** I saw and enjoyed the first remake but have become disillusioned by the movies with each passing sequel. I really didn't think this would be very interesting, but was happily very surprised.
* **Civil War:** Given the political climate of The United States around the time that this started to promo/release, I was very nervous as to this one having a bullshit political agenda \[for either side\]. Given that it did not, and took steps to really make sure the audience couldn't try to pull an agenda out of it, I was able to fully enjoy the romp.
* **Gladiator II:** I'm getting sick of these 20 years later sequels and really had very low expectations for the movie. I don't think it's the amazing film my wife thinks that it is, but I was definitely. . .Entertained.
* **Trap:** I was really annoyed by the trailers for this movie, which seemingly gives away ""the big reveal"" and ruins the entire thing - Except they pull back that curtain very early in the movie, and it's a non issue. Really enjoyed this way more than I expected to.
* **The Fall Guy:** This is one of those movies I went into ready to be annoyed, because I had seen promos for it way too many times and was just sick of seeing that stupid trailer over and over again. I just had zero expectations going in and was pleasantly surprised. At the time of this blurb I think I've seen it 3 times, which is unusual for me.
* **Wicked:** Coming off the heels of Mean Girls. . And Dear Even Hanson. . And pretty much all modern Broadway movies, I had almost no expectations at all for this one. I love Broadway, and was ready to nap my way through it. . .Though Wicked definitely proved me wrong, that you can do a musical correctly.
* **The Iron Claw:** If you told me I'd ever feel bad for a jacked up Zac Efron I would have laughed at you, and yet here we are. The only thing that stops this from being a top contender for me is that technically it came out last year, though I saw it after that list.
* **Alien: Romulus:** I know I'll be crucified for saying this, but I've never seen a full Alien movie all the way through. It just wasn't ever my thing, though we both really enjoyed it. I have since wanted to make my way through a chronological of the entire series, though have found myself lacking time to get around to it.
* **I Saw The TV Glow:** This is a movie that I didn't expect very much from, other than having a weird nostalgia feel to it. I really enjoyed most of it, but as it started to get really trippy towards the end it lost me.
* **Twisters:** On the list of movies that I ever thought would get a sequel this far down the road? I mean Twister seems like an easy enough candidate with a very generic premise, but I never really imagined it would happen. . .And yet it works. . .It works because it's no more a sequel of Twister than any generic disaster movie is \[not\] a sequel to another generic disaster movie of the same disaster. . . Does that even make sense? I don't know, but it was fun.

# Enjoyed it, but Probably Wouldn't Watch Again

* **Here:** The movie is just different, unlike anything I've ever seen before. I don't know if the gimmick is worth a second viewing, but it captivated me on the first one.
* **Red One:** Generic holiday action romp, we've been getting a bunch of these in the last few years. Glad I saw it, don't regret the time spent. . .Might get 2-3 minutes of my time if I'm ever flipping through channels and it happens to be on.
* **A Real Pain:** If I wasn't limiting myself to 3 movies in ""Favorites of the Year,"" this would probably be number 4. . Though The ambiguity of the ending feels pointless \[there really isn't much to think about in that regard\]. 
* **Arthur the King:** This is probably the first movie that has ever made me legitimately cry. I walked out of the theater nearly bawling. I give it props for that, but I have no desire to subject myself to it again.
* **American Fiction:** I'd say the first 2 acts of the movie are almost perfect, but I really didn't care for the way they did the ending in multiple paths. Like. . I got it from an author perspective, but I just don't feel like it worked.
* **Challengers:** I think my wife has probably seen this 5 times since it came out. I don't know if I can watch it again. Its a slower moving film, which isn't really my thing - I enjoyed it, I liked it a lot actually, but I don't think I'll be returning to the couch to see it again.
* **Babes:** It's funny in the same way all of those comedies about a very specific situation being dramatized for comedy are funny. The movie works because its a premise that I haven't seen before. But I don't think the magic will work a second time.
* **Dune: Part Two:** Look, both Dune movies are very good. . And yea I've read the source material, but they're also very long and slow. I'm glad I saw it, but I don't need to watch it again.
* **The Bikeriders:** I'll be honest - I write these things at the end of the year, because I want to focus on the feelings of my experience, and not really the plot itself. . .And while I remember enjoying it, I also remember thinking it was very long; but other than that I couldn't give you much else.
* **Blink Twice:** Blink Twice covers some rough themes that people don't typically want to think about, but the movie works as a crazy drug induced thriller. There's a decent revenge payoff, and I go home happy.
* **Bob Marley: One Love:** No idea how accurate the movie is, but it's a fun ride.
* **Sonic The Hedgehog 3:** It's cute, just like the first 2. The story is pretty basic but I appreciate it's the type of movie that is made for kids, but the writers didn't forget that Sonic is a 90s icon, and that its older fans would be watching it too.

# The Mediocre Movie I Expected it to be

* **Beetlejuice Beetlejuice:** It hits a lot of the notes you need a sequel like this to hit, but I also felt like everything was reductive and surface level. We went with the in-laws, who loved it, but I didn't think it was that great.
* **Venom: The Last Dance:** Just like Venom 1 and 2 it has its moments - I'm not sure if 2 or 3 is the weaker movie, and I almost certainly will never watch it again, but I don't regret the time. . Or the laughs.
* **It Ends with Us:** I might be biased because my wife dragged me to this on the same weekend I dragged her to Borderlands, which maybe artificially props up my feelings of it - But I didn't totally hate it. 
* **A Quiet Place: Day One:** Is Day One necessary? Probably not. But I think it's definitely a better entry into this mythos than the sequel was.
* **Monkey Man**: Indian John Wick. . .It's decent, but nothing I haven't seen before.
* **Longlegs:** The movie isn't scary, and it's not really much of a thriller, but it certainly is creepy and Nicholas Cage has always played the weirdo card really well. . .Or that's just who he is.
* **Abigail:** It's just fun - There's nothing special about it - The reveal in the end isn't anything interesting, hell the ending itself is confusing with all the back and forth. But there are vampire ballerina kids, and that's just the kind of silliness we need sometimes.

# Expected More and Left Disappointed

* **MaXXXine:** Two years ago X was one of my top movies of the year. And even Pearl with all of its Wizard of Oz whimsy felt like a pretty strong movie. It's not that MaXXXine is a bad movie, I just expected more than a semi-generic horror/thriller. It felt as though the movie itself was written to be its own thing and the X mythos was just tacked onto it before shooting.
* **IF:** I don't really know what I was expecting with this one. . .But I always sort of hoped it would be some kind of Fosters Home for Imaginary Friends x Ryan Reynolds movie. It sort of just felt like too much was going on, and not enough was going on. . All at the same time.
* **Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire:** Afterlife may have been really reductive of previous Ghostbusters movies, but it was enjoyable and fun. Frozen Empire was just flat the entire time and at 2h4m it felt about 45 minutes longer than necessary.
* **The Book of Clarence**: I can't quite tell if this movie just wasn't for my particular audience, or if it just wasn't very good. But it felt very long and confusing the entire way through.
* **Imaginary:** Generic gimmick horror movie is generic gimmick horror movie. Nothing special, move along.
* **The Watchers:** I don't know why I expected more, that's stupid of me. I don't actually hate The Watchers, but I do think the whole ending is kind of stupid.
* **Y2K:** I wasn't expecting a masterpiece with this one, but I thought it would be a fun nostalgia trip. I do think the first 20-30 minutes are super solid, but once we start getting into the ""AI takes over the world"" problem the whole thing sort of just falls apart, and none of the payoff feels earned.
* **Moana 2:** The original is a true favorite of mine, but this one feels like it's exclusively for the kids. And that's totally fine, just wasn't for me.

# Didn't Expect Much, and Got What I Expected

* **The Crow:** I've actually never seen the original The Crow \[I know\] but I typically don't expect much from remakes/reimaginings anyway. There were parts that I ""didn't hate"" but overall it fell flat for me.
* **Mean Girls:** Mean Girls, the Broadway Show, is really good. This entire movie felt flat with a lot of the songs pushed into more monotone registers to makeup for hiring talent that didn't have very high vocal range. . Other than Renee Rapp. I also felt like a lot of the nods to the original movie were done in an ""ok fine we have to"" way, instead of honoring the source material.
* **The Front Room:** I didn't expect much. . Actually I don't know what I was expecting. . .Certainly it wasn't a seemingly ancient woman shitting herself constantly. It felt like The Front Room kept building to something that never paid off.
* **Immaculate:** Sydney Sweeny starring in ""i'm hot, oh but also I'm a nun that fucked up."" The movie has no substance to it and I was grateful when it was over. The only thing saving it from Worst of the Year is just how bad some of those movies are.

# Worst of the Year

* **Night Swim:** I liked the premise of this one and really wanted to like it, but it just felt like it was missing pretty much everything a good horror movie needs.
* **Madame Web:** This movie doesn't deserve my thoughts or punctuation
* **Borderlands:** I didn't expect Borderlands to be a good movie at all - It's one of my favorite game franchises and I had no hope that Hollywood wouldn't screw it up, but I was at least hoping for something that made sense and might hit the ""so bad it's good"" point. The movie is just bad, and oddly the one casting choice everyone thought made no sense \[Kevin Hart\] is the one casting choice that I felt actually worked.
* **Argylle:** This may be the worst movie I've ever seen, and I used to make a point to watch some of the worst movies \[as reviewed on IMDB\] as a fun group activity with friends. At no point in its incoherent rambling did Argylle make any sense, and I wish it would be erased from my brain.

**Note:** At roughly $23/m for the AMC subscription that means I spent about $5/ticket to see each movie. My wife sometimes do buy concessions \[sometimes with points, sometimes without\], maybe next year I'll track that too, just to see how expensive a hobby this actually is.

**Movies we will probably see in the next week:**

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-1236245428/) (40):

>I’ve seen much worse comic-book movies than “Kraven the Hunter,” but maybe the best way to sum up my feelings about the film is to confess that I didn’t stay to see if there was a post-credits teaser. That’s a dereliction of duty, but it’s one I didn’t commit on purpose. I simply hadn’t bothered to think about it.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson-marvel-1236200914/):

>It turns out to be a spectacular action- and character-driven performance from Aaron Taylor-Johnson and some tight exciting filmmaking from director J.C. Chandor, whose previous films, other than Triple Frontier, are far more indie in style and scope


[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/marvel-movies/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (50):

>Though closer in quality to Morbius than Venom, Kraven is far from a catastrophe and serves up a decent helping of bloodthirsty, globe-trotting action. Taylor-Johnson makes a muscular if self-satisfied protagonist in a film that would have been better off standing on its own shoeless feet than cravenly (or should that be, 'kravenly') cleaving itself to its comic book brethren.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review-1235075341/) (C-):

>Immune to fan response, impervious to quality control, and so broadly unencumbered by its place in a shared universe that most of its scenes don’t even feel like they take place in the same *film*, “Kraven the Hunter” might be very, very bad (and by “might be” I mean “almost objectively is”), but the more relevant point is that it feels like it was made by people who have no idea what today’s audiences might consider as “good.

[Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/) (50):

>After nine years, Aaron Taylor-Johnson returns to Marvel superhero fare, but while Kraven the Hunter has potential, it's a middling origin story.

>Sony, still possessing the film rights to Spider-Man, decided to make an interconnected Spider-Man Villain universe, of which ""Kraven the Hunter"" is the final chapter. Watching Chandor's film, though, one can see that neither the studio nor the filmmakers are interested in starting anything anymore. There is no presumption that fans will be interested in long-form mythmaking, and sequel teases remain light. This allows ""Kraven"" to be stupid on its own. And, in a weird way, that's a relief. We're free.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/11/kraven-the-hunter-review-russell-crowe-busts-up-laborious-superhero-yarn) (2/5):

[The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/kraven-the-hunter-review) (67):

>Kraven The Hunter gets closer than any of its predecessors to understanding the silly, entertaining freedom of shedding continuity. Then again, maybe it’s best that this misbegotten series quits while it’s just-barely ahead.

[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson/) (1/5):

>If you thought Morbius and Madame Web were bad, the extended Spider-Man Universe hits a new rock bottom with this diabolical entry

[Collider](https://collider.com/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (3/10):

>*Kraven the Hunter*'s bland storytelling, subpar acting, and staggering technical issues are proof that the *Spider-Man* IP needs to be protected before it becomes an endangered species.

Directed by J.C. Chandor:

>Kraven has a complex relationship with his father which sets him on a path of vengeance and motivates him to become the greatest and most feared hunter.

To say that it was a great Thanksgiving weekend would be selling it short.

***Moana 2*** surpassed every expectation and delivered a record-breaking debut for the Thanksgiving weekend. And with the aid of ***Wicked*** and ***Gladiator II***, it was the busiest weekend of the year.

The Top 10 earned a combined $269.2 million this weekend ($412.8 million five-day). That's not just a colossal 210% up from last year, but it's also the biggest Thanksgiving weekend ever.

Debuting on top, ***Moana 2*** earned a colossal $139.7 million in 4,200 theaters. Adding its numbers from Wednesday, the debut rises to $225.4 million in five days. It broke so many records, including the biggest debut for a Walt Disney Animation Studios film debut, as well as the highest Thanksgiving weekend. But most importantly; it beat ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** ($204.6 million) for the biggest Wednesday-to-Sunday debut. 

A fantastic debut all around, and it shouldn't be a surprise. If you've followed the Top 10 charts on streaming, you'll find that ***Moana*** has been one of the most streamed films in the past years. It was even reported that it was the most streamed film across all services last year. Needless to say, ***Moana*** became far more popular with years, and audiences hoped for a sequel to come.

Disney, for some reason, was interested in doing it but only as a TV show for Disney+. In February 2024, it was revealed that the show was retooled into a film that would hit theaters this Thanksgiving. With an extensive marketing campaign, Disney successfully got people into giving this film a chance. 

According to Disney, 65% of the audience was female, and 60% was 18 and over. Critics were not enthused with the film, and it currently sits at 64% on RT. The audience was more forgiving, giving it an ""A–"" on CinemaScore, although that falls on the lower end of WDAS titles. There are no animated titles on its way until ***Dog Man*** in January, so it can leg out through the holidays. $500 million is pretty much guaranteed, and can go as high as $600 million if it can hold very well.

After defying gravity on its opening weekend, ***Wicked*** continued flying high. It earned $81.1 million this weekend ($118.2 million five-day). That marks an insane 28% drop, which breaks the record set by ***Top Gun: Maverick*** (29%) as the smallest drop for a $100+ million opener. Of course, ***Maverick*** achieved that record on the weekend after Memorial Day, but it didn't face a $100+ million opener on its second weekend.

Through ten days, ***Wicked*** has earned a colossal $263.1 million domestically. It's already the highest grossing Broadway musical adaptation, passing ***Grease*** ($188 million). Of course, ***Grease*** is still ahead in terms of adjusted inflation ($770 million), but ***Wicked*** remains a colossal success. It should hit $400 million without any problem, and the holidays can help it get close to $500 million by the end of its run.

Paramount's ***Gladiator II*** added $31 million this weekend. That represents a 44% drop, which is fine, but not fantastic considering how well the other holdovers did. Through 10 days, Ridley Scott's sequel has earned $111.4 million, passing ***Robin Hood*** and ***Black Hawk Down*** to become Scott's 6th highest grossing film domestically. The film should finish with over $150 million domestically, quite down from the original's $187 million lifetime gross.

After a steep second weekend drop, Amazon MGM's ***Red One*** eased a light 4%, adding $12.7 million this weekend. The film has earned $75.8 million so far, and depending on next week's drop, it could still hit $100 million. Although it's hard to call this a bonafide hit considering its colossal $250 million budget.

Lionsgate's ***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** was still on the Top 5, easing just 6% and adding $3.2 million. The film has earned $31.9 million domestically.

In sixth place, Angel Studios' ***Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin*** fell 54% and added $2.3 million this weekend ($3.3 million five-day). That's a very weak drop, especially considering it had Thanksgiving. Through ten days, the film has amassed $9.6 million and will close with less than $15 million.

***Venom: The Last Dance*** is still holding well, dipping 43% this weekend and adding $2.2 million. The film has amassed $137.8 million so far, which is still far behind the previous ***Venom*** films.

A24's ***Heretic*** continues falling. This weekend, it fell 57% and added $956K this weekend. With $26.8 million in the bank, it's now gonna finish below $30 million.

In the face of ***Moana 2***, DreamWorks' ***The Wild Robot*** had its worst drop yet. It collapsed 67% this weekend, adding $700,000 to its run. The film has earned $142.5 million, and it's nearing the end of its run.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Searchlight's ***A Real Pain***, which recovered after its weak drop last weekend. The film dipped 39%, grossing $655,910 this weekend. The film has earned just $6.1 million, and barring some huge Oscar noms, it looks like it might miss $10 million.

Outside the Top 10 was Focus Features' ***Conclave***, which dipped 46% and earned $616,955 this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $30.1 million domestically. A damn great run for an adult drama.

Neon's ***Anora*** is winding down, and it's now playing in just 230 theaters. This weekend, it dipped 43% and added $385,292. Its domestic total stands at $12.7 million.

A24 debuted Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer*** in 7 theaters, earning $188,808. That translates to a $26,973 per-theater average, which is quite middling (it barely cracks the top 20 highest PTA of the year). For comparison, it's barely above ***Bones and All*** ($24,201), and far below ***Suspiria*** ($92,019) and ***Call Me By Your Name*** ($103,233). The film will continue expanding through the holidays.

#**OVERSEAS**

The records don't stop just in America for ***Moana 2***.

***Moana 2*** debuted with a colossal $163 million overseas, which means it debuted with $389.2 million worldwide. That broke ***Mario***'s record ($377 million) for the biggest animated debut in history. The biggest markets were France ($18.8M), UK ($15.5M), Mexico ($11.1M), Germany ($10.5M), Italy ($9.3M), South Korea ($9.1M), Australia ($8.3M), Brazil ($7.5M), China ($6.5M) and Spain ($5.5M). An easy billion right here, ladies and gentlemen. 

***Wicked*** is a monster hit domestically, but that popularity hasn't fully connected with the rest of the world. This weekend, the film earned $29 million from the overseas markets, taking the worldwide total to $360.3 million. It's still killing it in the UK ($36M) and Australia ($12.9M), and it has performed well in South Korea ($8.5M), Mexico ($6.7M), and Philippines ($3.5M). The rest of the markets... not so much. While it still has some markets left, the film will be domestic-heavy. The film is cleary a hit, but it's crazy how the domestic market represents a huge 73% of its worldwide gross.

***Gladiator II*** added $27.2 million this weekend, and its worldwide total is now $320.2 million. The best markets are the UK ($29.7M), France ($22.5M), Spain ($15M), Mexico ($12.9M) and Australia ($11.5M). The film should pass the original's $272 million foreign gross, but it's unlikely it can pass its worldwide gross ($460 million).

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Beetlejuice Beetlejuice* | Sep/6 | Warner Bros. | $111,003,345 | $294,100,435 | $450,053,961 | $100M
*Saturday Night* | Sep/27 | Sony | $3,400,583 | $9,509,312 | $9,752,378 | $25M
*Terrifier 3* | Oct/11 | Cineverse | $18,928,113 | $53,981,071 | $94,436,616 | $2M

- 36 years in the making and it paid off, as ***Beetlejuice Beetlejuice*** closed with a fantastic $294 million domestically, finishing as Burton's second highest grossing film, just a little behind ***Alice in Wonderland*** ($334 million). Interestingly, that popularity wasn't as strong overseas, as the domestic market represented 65.3% of its worldwide gross. It's still a great $450 million worldwide, although ***Alice*** ($1 billion) and ***Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*** ($474 million) finished far higher. Despite a few duds here and there, Tim Burton is still as popular as he's ever been.

- ***Saturday Night Live*** might be popular 50 years later, but that doesn't mean the audience is interested in a film depicting its first ever broadcast. That was the case for Jason Reitman's ***Saturday Night***, which closed with a very poor $9.5 million domestically. The film was positioned as an Oscars contender, but the film fizzled out by the time it hit wide release and faded quickly. Don't expect the rest of the world to save it, given that ***Saturday Night Live*** isn't as popular as the States. 

- Last month, we had two movies revolving around a clown as its protagonist. ***Joker: Folie à Deux*** became one of the worst received comic book films of all time, allowing Art the Clown to emerge as the winner of the month. And now, ***Terrifier 3*** has closed with a damn fantastic $94 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing unrated film ever. Shattered the ceilling of what a film like this could achieve, and elevating Art to one of the most iconic horror villains of modern times. Damien Leone has already confirmed a fourth film is coming up. Art in space when?

#**THIS WEEKEND**

The post-Thanksgiving weekend is usually a dumping ground for studios. With the Christmas season kicking off, people are busy, which is why studios avoid releasing anything big. It's up to the small films to get a chance. This weekend, we have two newcomers and none of them stand a chance in dethroning ***Moana 2***. None will even touch $10 million this weekend.

The only one with a confirmed wide release is A24's ***Y2K***, which marks Kyle Mooney's debut as writer and director. The film stars Jaeden Martell, Julian Dennison, Rachel Zegler, Fred Durst, and Alicia Silverstone, and depicts an imaginative version of the Year 2000 problem, where a bug causes all technology to come to life and turn against humanity. The film has received mixed reviews (63% on RT), and horror comedies have not performed well as of late. We'll see how it does, but a debut under A24's ***Heretic*** ($10.8 million) seems pretty much imminent.

The other film, although in far less theaters, is Searchlight's ***Nightbitch***. A film that stars Amy Adams as a mother who transforms into a dog. Like, seriously. Y'all complain about lack of originality in Hollywood? Well, here's a very unique premise. Reviews are quite similar to ***Y2K***, and marketing has been very limited so far. This suggests it won't be a very wide release.

And for those curious, Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** is returning to theaters this Friday for a limited time on IMAX screens. You should hurry up, for screenings are quickly getting sold out.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/venom-the-last-dance-review-tom-hardy-chiwetel-ejiofor-1236185751/):

>The “Venom” films are part of Sony’s Spider-Man Universe (that is such a tedious sentence to write, let alone contemplate). And maybe that’s why Tom Hardy, from the first “Venom” on, has chosen to offset the uncoolness of doing a comic-book franchise by putting his slumming in quotation marks, playing Eddie as a borderline doofus who talks like a grown-up version of one of the Bowery Boys. The performance has worked, in a certain way, because it kept the whole series light. But it has also ensured that the “Venom” movies are a lark and nothing more, geared to the arrested pleasure centers of fanboys: the more snark and CGI the better.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/10/venom-the-last-dance-review-tom-hardy-1236156179/):

>It’s not the best of its kind, but by no means the worst, and even when the inevitable war breaks out between humans, xenophages and symbiotes, Marcel orchestrates the action in a surprisingly comprehensible style that’s more reminiscent of Ang Lee’s underrated Hulk than the ultra-Michael Bay chaos that comes with most CG smackdowns. It’s small recompense, however, for the sight of Venom disco-dancing to ABBA in a Vegas penthouse; surely no one will ever take the threat of a symbiote invasion seriously after that.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/venom-the-last-dance-review-tom-hardy-marvel-1236042242/) (60):

>Hardy brings sufficient charm (and witty voice work) to his symbiote-inhabited character’s internal battle between id and superego to make each entry diverting enough, even if they leave little aftertaste. And so it goes with Venom: The Last Dance, which caps the trilogy by going gleefully out on its own.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/venom-the-last-dance-review-1235059391/) (58):

>Despite the film’s best efforts to melt its characters into the vast sludge of superhero cinema, the union between Eddie and Venom is simply too pure to be diluted down to nothing. Thanks to Hardy, even the least of the movies in this franchise is definitely something, and it’s something that its genre may not be able to survive without.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1695477/venom-the-last-dance-tom-hardy-marvel-movie-review/) (40):

>If there is one bright spot in ""Venom: The Last Dance,"" it's Tom Hardy. Once again doing a questionable voice while vibing on his weirdo energy, Hardy makes Eddie Brock an almost tragic figure; a lonely guy cut off from the rest of the world, with only a wisecracking alien monster for company. He shuffles about like a man uncomfortable in his own skin, looking awkward and aghast. He's operating on a different level than this lousy film. Unfortunately, he's not getting much backup. 

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/venom-the-last-dance-review-tom-hardy) (4/10):

>Venom: The Last Dance trips over its own tendrils and lets a boring, generic plot, and bad action distract from the surprisingly resilient central relationship between Eddie Brock and his symbiote bestie.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/venom-the-last-dance/) (40):

>It’s third time unlucky for a series that still hasn’t worked out what it wants to be. The Last Dance can’t find its rhythm.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/venom-the-last-dance-review-tom-hardy/):

>“Venom: The Last Dance” really wants you to think it’s the end. Throughout the film, Venom talks about wanting to see the Statue of Liberty like a cop with two weeks until retirement talks about taking his wife on a long-delayed boat trip, right after one final case. There’s a suggestion of a sequel but it plays more like a threat: “If you see this movie we’ll make you watch another one.” So maybe let’s not. If this is what Sony thinks the “Venom” movies should be like, they can keep it. What a lousy way to say goodbye. No greatest hits. Just a strikeout.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/23/venom-the-last-dance-review-tom-hardy-marvel) (2/5):

venom2,venom sequel,1fsm7u6,"Dracula Untold - Man, I kind of want a sequel.","Recently watched on Netflix. It’s really not that bad. It has some flaws of course, but Luke Evans and Charles Dance are very compelling in this world.

I think the biggest mistake was the setting and the villain; both were just boring. The end of the film fast forwards to a modern setting and imo the film should have made this jump immediately because most of the intriguing plot points centered around Vlad and his relationship with his master.

The Dark Universe stuff was killed pretty early on and I think the audience misses out on a lot because of it. We have had like 4 Venom movies, you can’t tell me that a sequel to Dracula Untold and The Mummy would have been any worse than those movies.

venom2,venom sequel,1cu0h1d,When Studios Meddle: How Interference Can Ruin Great Movies,"I wanted to start a discussion on a topic that really grinds my gears: when studios meddle with movies and end up ruining what could have been great films. Two prime examples that come to mind are ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" and Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 3."" Both of these films had so much potential but were ultimately bogged down by studio interference.

# The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (TASM 2)

TASM 2 had a lot going for it. Andrew Garfield was an excellent Spider-Man, and the chemistry between him and Emma Stone was electric. But instead of focusing on a coherent storyline, the studio decided to cram in multiple villains and set up future movies. Electro, Green Goblin, and the half-baked Rhino all in one movie? It was too much, too fast. The result was a jumbled mess that failed to do justice to any of the characters.

# Spider-Man 3

Sam Raimi’s ""Spider-Man 3"" is another classic case of studio interference gone wrong. Raimi wanted to focus on Sandman and Harry Osborn’s storyline, but the studio insisted on including Venom to appeal to fans. The result was an overstuffed plot that couldn’t give any of the storylines the attention they deserved. The forced inclusion of Venom felt out of place and led to a disjointed narrative that disappointed many fans, including myself.

# The Amazing Spider-Man (TASM) Franchise

And let's not forget the whole TASM franchise. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" had set such a promising tone. It was grittier and more grounded, which I personally loved

. The first TASM movie is actually my favorite Spider-Man film. However, the franchise was cut short not just because of poor critical reception but also due to the studio's incessant meddling. They were so focused on setting up a cinematic universe to compete with the MCU that they forgot to create a solid standalone sequel. TASM 2's failure was a huge letdown and eventually led to the character's reboot in the MCU.

# Other Notable Mentions

While these Spider-Man films are clear examples, they’re not alone. Studio interference has plagued many other movies:

* **Justice League (2017)**: The theatrical cut suffered from a jarring shift in tone and incomplete story arcs due to the studio’s decision to replace Zack Snyder with Joss Whedon and impose a strict runtime.
* **Fantastic Four (2015)**: Behind-the-scenes clashes and last-minute changes resulted in a disjointed and poorly received movie that didn’t do the iconic team justice.
* **Suicide Squad (2016)**: The final product felt like a mismatched medley of reshoots and edits aimed at making the film more lighthearted and marketable, straying from David Ayer’s original, darker vision.

# Conclusion

It’s frustrating to see how potential blockbusters can be derailed by studio decisions aimed at maximizing profits or establishing franchise potential. Often, these decisions lead to convoluted plots and underdeveloped characters, alienating fans and critics alike. I’d love to hear your thoughts and other examples of movies that were ruined by studio meddling.

Reviews:

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/madame-web-review-dakota-johnson-1235909003/):

>Now, if 10-year-old me could’ve predicted the future (the way Cassie Webb can), he would’ve seen this disappointment as valuable practice for a movie like “Madame Web,” a hollow Sony-made Spider-Man spinoff with none of the charm you expect from even the most basic superhero movie. The title mutant — who’s never actually identified by that name — hails from the margins of the Marvel multiverse, which suggests that, much as Sony did with “Morbius” and “Venom,” the studio is scrounging to find additional fringe characters to exploit.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/madame-web-review-dakota-johnson-1235823007/):

>There’s something so demoralizing about lambasting another underwhelming Marvel offering. What is there left to really say about the disappointments and ocean-floor-level expectations created by the mining of this intellectual property? Every year, studio executives dig up minor characters, dress them in a fog of hype and leave moviegoers to debate, defend or discard the finished product. 

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/madame-web-review-dakota-johnson-1234953452/) (D+):

>I can’t say for sure that “Madame Web” has been hacked to pieces and diluted within an inch of its life by a studio machine that has no idea what it’s trying to make or why, but Sony’s latest swing at superhero glory stars an actress whose affect seems to perfectly channel their audience’s expectation for better material. Johnson is one of the most naturally honest and gifted performers to ever play the lead role in one of these things, and while that allows her to elevate certain moments in this movie way beyond where they have any right to be, it also makes it impossible for her to hide in the moments that lay bare their own miserableness.

[Inverse](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/madame-web-review):

>Madame Web is Embarrassing For Everyone Involved. With great power, comes another terrible Sony Spider-verse movie.

[Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/madame-web-review-dakota-johnson-mcu-spider-man-spinoff-1234956689/):

>“The best thing about the future is — it hasn’t happened yet,” someone intones near the end of Madame Web, and indeed, you look forward to a future in which this film’s end credits (which, spoiler alert, are sans stinger scenes previewing coming-soon plot points; even Sony was like, yeah, enough of this already) are in your rearview mirror and gone from your memory. Or an alternate world years from now in which this unintentional comedy of intellectual-property errors has been ret-conned into a sort of cult camp classic — a Showgirls of comic-book cinema. Until then, you’re left with a present in which you’re compelled to cringe for two hours, pretend none of this ever happened, and ruefully say the words you’d never imagine uttering: “Come back, Morbius, all is forgiven.” 

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1516331/madame-web-review/) (6/10):

>Lacking superhero grandiosity, however, all but assures we'll never see sequels or follow-ups where these characters grow into the heroines we know they'll be. ""Madame Web"" does not provide a crowd-pleasing bombast. This is a pity, as this odd duck makes for a fascinating watch. This may be one of the final films of the superhero renaissance. Enjoy it before it topples over entirely. 

[Collider](https://collider.com/madame-web-review/) (3/10):

>Beyond even those staggeringly amateurish filmmaking flourishes, *Madame Web* has none of the laughs or thrills that general audiences come to superhero movies for. Much like *Morbius* from two years ago, it’s a pale imitation of comic book motion pictures from the past. In this case, *Web* cribs pools of magic water, unresolved parental trauma, teenage superhero antics, and other elements from the last two decades of Marvel adaptations. Going that route merely makes *Madame Web* feel like a half-hearted rerun, though, rather than automatically rendering it as good as *The Avengers* or *Across the Spider-Verse.* Not even immediately delivering that sweet “moms researching spiders in the Amazon before they die” action right away can salvage *Madame Web*.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/madame-web-review-dakota-johnson-sydney-sweeney) (5/10): 

>Madame Web has the makings of a interesting superhero psychological thriller, but with a script overcrowded with extraneous characters, basic archetypes, and generic dialogue, it fails the talent and the future of its onscreen Spider-Women.

[The Nerdist](https://nerdist.com/article/madame-web-review-sony-spider-movie-is-a-tedious-lifeless-tangle/):

>But bad directing, bad plotting, and bad acting aren’t the worst thing about Madame Web. The most grueling aspect is how oddly it exists within the larger Sony Spiderverse. You know immediately who characters like Ben are meant to be, but the film never just comes out and says anything. At one point, Emma Roberts appears as a character who exists just to wink largely in your face without any notable revelations.

[Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/madame-web-movie-review/):

>While Venom still manages to be fun, in large part thanks to Tom Hardy's ability to sell the relationship between Eddie Brock and his alien symbiote, Madame Web is boring, unimaginative and dated, despite being one of very few superhero movies centering on female superheroes. All in all, Madame Web is a superhero movie you can absolutely skip.

[Paste](https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/dakota-johnson/madame-web-movie-review):

>At times, the movie’s pleasingly jumpy visual scheme and nostalgic 2003-era cheese threaten to form an alliance and make Madame Web work in spite of itself. After all, the movie, even or especially in its worst moments, never gets dull (or weirdly smug, like its sibling Venom movies). It also never fully sheds a huckster-y addiction to pivoting, until it’s pretty far afield from what works about either a superhero movie or a loopy woo-woo thriller. Unlike Johnson, the movie’s visible calculations never make it look disengaged from the process, or even unconvincing. Just kinda stupid.

venom2,venom sequel,18x6rmy,What are some PG13 movies that should’ve been rated R?,"My picks are Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox and several other DC animated films. The film was extremely bloody and graphic for a PG13 movie. Not just that, but several other DC animated films were just as bloody and violent and still got PG13 ratings. Examples: Justice League: The New Frontier, The Dark Knight Returns, Son of Batman etc. And not a DC film but Venom and its sequel. I also think that the Dune film should’ve been R because there is some stuff in the book that would not give it a PG13 remake and had some extremely violent moments.",0,36,1704245637.0,2024-01-03 01:33:57,False

I've only seen Rocky, Creed, Creed 2, and bits and pieces of Rocky 4

I've only seen the first Lethal Weapon and Predator (Though changing that tonight by watching Prey)

Of the Robocop movies, I've only seen the first one not the sequels or the remake

I've sat through Jurassic Park, Jurassic Park 3, and Jurassic World; started watching Jurassic Park 2 once but didn't finish it and I didn't see either of the Jurassic World sequels

I only saw Shrek 1, 2, and I put both Holiday specials on in the background while I was doing something else

I only watched the first 2 Ice Age movies

I've seen The Land Before Time but none of the 15 sequels it has

I only bothered with the first Venom not the sequel or Morbius (If the Spider-Man villain movies count as their own franchise)

I only watched the first X-Men movie and Deadpool and Deadpool 2 if they count as X-Men movies

venom2,venom sequel,v7sltj,Nostalgia blostalgia – What happened to the Box Office leaders varying in genre (and sometimes even being targeted for Adults),"As a 1990 kid, I have a strong tendency to look backwards in movie history as opposed to forwards.

 

Personally – and I’m sure this is me being “old” that films, at least popular films, used to be more varied when it comes to genre and feel.  Nowadays, it feels like it all conglomerated into the lowest common denominator (MCU/Nostalgia cash grabs). So I checked it out. 

In an attempt to possibly see when and where this went wrong, below are the top 5 grossing films of each year from 88 – present. I chose this time period even though my favorite films of all time aren’t in it (Animal house, Alien, Raiders of the lost arc) because its easier and it’s a snapshot of my life through popular film.

 

From 17-22 of the top 5 movies (25 spots total) – In the last 5 years – Every single top 5 box office film was either a Super hero movie or a Cash grab on nostalgia that was either a remake or a sequel on something from 20+ years ago…  with the exception of fast and furious films or children’s movies.

 

Compare that to 88-92 you have at least 11 films that were not designed for kids and weren’t sequels… and those sequels at were not nostalgia grabs…  and the ones designed for kids were mostly live action…  like Home Alone - and in 93 – you have 4 films not designed for kids and Mrs. Doubtfire…

 

Ofc – Box office gross isn’t always the best measure of if a film is good or not… just if its popular… For EX, My favorite movies, including Die Hard, aren’t listed here. Specifically, stuff like The Bird Cage and the Judd Apatow/Todd Phillips (minus the hangover 2) films I grew up peeing my pants over just barely missed the top 5… Total Recall too - and office space is no where near it (not to mention 12 monkeys, the 5th element etc… and movies like Thoroughbreds and Ex Machina that will never gross this much)

 

However – I think you can still see the difference in what’s popular and also what got made/pushed through the list.

 

My big takeaway is that there have always been IP, Kids films, and major Block buster films, but somewhere around 2001 studios, and I guess the masses, started really pushing for what we see today, Superheroes, and Kids movies.... And nostalgia cash grabs.

 

You’ll notice that there were a lot more films designed for adults (like my mother, not like the 45 year old arrested dev elopement kid) and more varied genres making their way to the top 5… most notably comedies and rom coms.

 

I’m wondering what you all think has caused this shift and what you all make of it.

venom2,venom sequel,tsmxd9,'Morbius' Review Thread,"[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/morbius): 16% (117 reviews) with 3.8 in average rating

> Critics consensus: Cursed with uninspired effects, rote performances, and a borderline nonsensical story, this Spidey-adjacent mess is a vein attempt to make Morbius happen.

[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/morbius): 37/100 (45 critics)

As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** 

> After a promising start, Daniel Espinosa’s long-delayed film only intermittently matches the intensity of the lead performance, and the script by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless becomes thin on story, stringing together chaotic outbursts and action clashes that build to a painstakingly foreshadowed “sibling” faceoff. None of that seems likely to deter the geek faithful, even if this new entry in Sony’s Spider-Man Universe often seems a lot like a boilerplate Venom installment, without the humor.

-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/morbius-jared-leto-1235122778/)

> “Morbius” mostly surprises because of how very dull it is. Case in point: After Michael’s bad deeds become publicized, local news teams term him “the Vampire Murderer,” an uninspired nickname that serves as a microcosm of everything “Morbius” is: mostly unnecessary, oddly unoriginal, and soon quite forgettable indeed.

-[Kate Erbland, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/2022/03/morbius-review-jared-leto-1234712158/): C-

> “Morbius” isn’t even a debacle. It’s a little over 90 minutes long if you don’t count the credits (which include what has to be the worst closing teaser I’ve ever seen in a Marvel movie), and for all the overwrought push of Jon Ekstrand’s score, the film is nothing more than a flimsy time-killer, an early-April placeholder of a movie. It’s as trashy and underimagined as the “Venom” films, though it’s easy to see why both of those became mega-hits: The character of Venom, who’s like a superhero merged with the creature from “Alien,” with a voice of basso showbiz effrontery, is an entertaining hunk of sci-fi demon eye candy. Whereas Leto’s teeth-baring monster-scientist truly looks like a relic from the ’70s. He never scares or dazzles or haunts you — not because Leto is less than a good actor, but because this isn’t a character based on acting. It’s based on the creakiest FX, the one (mild) exception being the painterly trails of digital “smoke” left behind by Morbius as he flies through the air.

-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2022/film/reviews/morbius-review-jared-leto-1235217960/)

> Morbius is unspectacular in ways that waste the potential of what could be an intriguing hybrid of sinister horror and superhero thrills. One single scene recalls David F. Sandberg’s Lights Out for a suitable fright, but otherwise horror accents are limited to cheesy jokes about Dracula. That’s the approach the whole film takes, in fact. Everything feels superfluous and uninterested in thoughtful storytelling because the mission at hand is to get to the end credits where the meat exists. Morbius is so focused on building Sony’s Spider-Man Universe and hopeful sequels — which could very well be better now that the foundation exists — that it forgets about enthusiastically engaging its audience from the start.

-[Matt Donato, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/morbius-review): 5.0 ""mediocre""

> What starts as a fun mad-scientist saga ends up in the usual big battle, and the journey drags along the way.

-[Alonso Duralde, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/morbius-film-review-jared-leto-matt-smith-marvel-spider-man/)

> It really is an amazingly pointless and dumb film: the good/bad setup between Morbius and Milo is muddled and cancelled by the not-especially-compelling moral struggle within Morbius himself. Both Leto and Smith have to keep doing the evil demonic face-change growling thing, and it is intensely silly. Let’s hope the extended Spider-Man universe extends far enough to include something more interesting than this.

-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/31/morbius-review-ludicrously-pointless-jekyll-and-hyde-vampire-monster-yarn): 1/5

> Most of the MCU movies and some of the recent DC films like “The Suicide Squad” are case studies on how to best introduce obscure superhero personas onto the screen. The gonzo “Venom” movies know and proudly own what they are. “Morbius” misses all those lessons and seems to be stuck among the more lackluster films from the early to mid 2000s a la “Elektra.” Even the mid-credits scenes that attempt to bring Leto’s role into a larger landscape wind up being more confusing than cool. Rather than a fang-tastic time, “Morbius” is just a soul-sucking effort.

-[Brian Truitt, USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/03/31/morbius-review-jared-leto-marvel-introduction-lifeless-slog/7223329001/): 1.5/4

> Beyond whatever scenes have been reworked, recut or just plain deleted from an abbreviated final cut, the movie shies away from the vampirism that could have made this more than a swift origin story: There’s surprisingly little blood in this sucker and, of course, eroticism is largely eschewed. The movie is most enticing when Dr. Michael Morbius feels like a threat to himself and/or others, and that feeling isn’t allowed to linger. It’s a perverse tactic, given that Sony transparently yearns for these villains to team up and take on some version, any version, of Spider-Man. The actual pre-credits body of Morbius doesn’t actually waste any time on this set-up. Yet there’s some kind of invisible force here, hurrying things along in the hopes of a future team-up, making sure this feature film arrives more undead than alive.

-[Jesse Hassenger, Paste Magazine](https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/morbius-review/): 5.9/10

> Without spoiling anything, a couple of post-credits sequences set up a future for Leto’s character in a larger world that you understand why Sony would try and telegraph, but given the failures of past Spider-Man spin-offs it’s hard to believe they have really thought any of those next steps through. But until then, Morbius feels like exactly the kind of second-tier superhero adventure audiences will accept in between ones that they actively want. Admittedly, it’s odd to want a movie like this to have been worse, but that would mean it failed as bigly as the swings it took; by comparison, Morbius is a walk, or at best a bunt. That may qualify it as a hit for Leto, Espinoza and Sony, but that doesn’t mean it’s much fun to watch from the stands.

-[Todd Gilchrist, The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/morbius-review-jared-leto-matt-smith-adria-arjona-spide-1848729603): C-

> “Morbius” is bad, yes, but it’s not even fun-bad, like the “Venom” movies; it’s just kind of depressing. There’s not a single thrilling, surprising, or entertaining moment in it, from start to finish, because comic book movies have reached a point of longevity and saturation that all of them are purely paint-by-number affairs: the laborious origin stories, the washed-out color palates, the bombastic scores, the daddy issues, the climactic barely-lit, CGI-heavy final fights to the death, and the mid-credit sequences to set up future installments. The nicest thing I can say about it is that it’s short.

-[Jason Bailey, The Playlist](https://theplaylist.net/morbius-review-dull-depressing-comic-book-horror-hybrid-20220330/): D-

> It looks like “Morbius” might soon cross paths with Spider-Man in one universe or another, but that would be a big step up for him, because his introductory vehicle feels more like a just-average 1990s vampire movie.

-[Richard Roeper, The Chicago Sun Times](https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2022/3/30/23003641/morbius-review-marvel-movie-jared-leto-matt-smith): 2/4

> Is Morbius the worst Marvel movie ever made? In an alternate universe without The New Mutants, the answer would likely be yes. And with all these multiverses now colliding into each other, who knows: There may even be a world out there where things actually came together for this old-school comic-book bloodsucker onscreen, where his determination to fight his newly monstrous nature while taking on the corrupt and the criminal gave us a deeper, darker antihero and Leto the chance to make his mark in the larger Marvel ecosphere. We’re stuck in this timeline, where the Morbius we’ve got is, plain and simple, a mess. If it’s not the worst of these films, it’s certainly the most anemic — and even die-hard fans are apt to feel completely drained by all of it.

Aside from the fact that Spider-Man has now been part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe since 2015, a franchise I dislike, they made things worse for me with NO WAY HOME because they brought Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and most of their villains into the MCU and (hopefully I’m wrong) retconned their deaths in their movies.

Sure, it had some funny moments but none that overstayed their welcome. The action was really good & brutal af but that ending/climax was insane & just tragic. It was a great twist though, a real gut-punch, the music in that scene still stays with me. I couldn't imagine being in a situation like that where something else is controlling my body movements. And I felt so damn bad for everyone at the end except S.T.E.M. It's funny, when I showed it to a friend, she said that the voice reminded her of the voice of H.A.L. 9000, but she didn't expect the film to go the direction that it did, which looking back now, that really should've been a clue about the twist about S.T.E.M. but neither of us caught it on our first watch.

venom2,venom sequel,ruaxif,I saw 86 movies in theaters in 2021. Here is my full ranking.,"Every year, I try to go the movie theater as much as possible. Usually 3-5 times a week but significantly less over the past 2 years. I like to keep stubs/dates/scores/etc for fun. In theaters, I saw 5 movies in 2015, 9 movies in 2016, 140 movies in 2017, 162 movies in 2018, 192 movies in 2019, and 44 movies in 2020. This is my full ranking of every movie I saw in theaters in 2021.

My reviews/scores are not meant to be anything serious, and it's really just a personal enjoyment scale, I don't keep a checklist or anything, just a ticket stub and a rating when I leave the theater, sorted at the end of the year with a few random thoughts. Scores sometimes change after re-watch and ranking, but most stay the same. I'll admit that my scores this year are probably more inflated than usual because being back in theaters on a regular basis was amazing. I try to stay away from reviews and trailers as much as possible so I can go in blind for most movies.

I got COVID in mid-December so I'm running behind on a lot of the more recent big movies and/or award-contenders (**Spider-Man**, **Nightmare Alley**, **Licorice Pizza**, **Passing**, **Matrix 4**, **Red Rocket**, **The Lost Daughter**, **Tender Bar,**  etc), but I should get to most of those in the coming week or so. I also skipped on a few other big titles (**Annette**, **The Suicide Squad**, **Godzilla vs. Kong**, etc). Hopefully next year will be better and I'll get close to my 200 goal. I don't rank anything I've seen outside of theaters.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Dune - 10/10**  

**Asia - 9/10** - *Depressing, heart-wrenching, and a closing scene that'll make you want to curl up into a ball and cry. I love a good punch like this once in a while. The pacing is a little bit off and it's very depressing, but it works. This movie came out of nowhere and is probably the one I regularly think about the most from 2021.* 

**Pig - 9/10**  

**Nomadland - 9/10**     

**King Richard - 9/10** - *This could have been another cheesy, shallow ego project (*ahem*, like American Underdog that I saw on January 1st, and will be low on the 2022 list), but it did so much more. I cried like a baby at the end, and Will Smith/Aunjanue Ellis/Jon Bernthal were an amazing trio and elevated this to be one of the best sports-biopics of the past decade.*

**The Father - 9/10** 

**The Green Knight - 9/10**  

**Murina - 8/10 -** *Biggest surprise of the year and the best debut film I saw in 2021. I'm a sucker for sun-drenched Mediterranean settings and the slow, tense build-up in this movie was great. It's extremely layered and well-performed.*  

**Last Night In Soho - 8/10**      
  
**No Time To Die - 8/10**    

**Titane - 8/10** - *Raw is one of my favorite movies of the past decade and *Titane* as a follow-up didn't disappointment.* 
 
**The Last Duel - 8/10** - *Historical-epics/mid-budget movies like this are an endangered species and I've missed them so much. It's a shame this movie was largely ignored. I think Adam Driver was miscast but overall* 

**Power of the Dog - 8/10** - *This could sweep the Oscars and I wouldn't be mad.*    

**Only the Animals - 8/10** - *Aside from the hilariously-ridiculous twist ending, this was a very solid mystery-thriller. Lots of twists. I love movies where you see intertwining perspectives that slowly lead to a satisfying conclusion. It felt a lot like Babel/Fargo with a more modern crime.*    

**Spencer - 8/10** - *I loved Jonny Greenwood's score (best of the year IMO), the costume design, and Kristen Stewart's performance. Another unique biopic from Pablo Larrain. Technically, it's a near-perfect movie, but the story doesn't quite match up.*

**The Eyes of Tammy Faye - 8/10** - 

**Belfast - 8/10** - *It makes you feel nostalgia and longing for a place you've never known, which I loved.  Career-best performances from Caitríona Balfe & Jamie Dornan. Even with only a few minutes of screentime, Ciarán Hinds deserves the Supporting Actor Oscar and I loved all of his scenes with Judi Dench. Reminded me of my grandparents, all of their scenes together either made me cry or laugh. Beautiful, personal little movie from Kenneth Branagh.*

**Don't Look Up - 8/10** - *A return to form from Adam McKay. Vice was a big disappointment, but this was pound-for-pound the funniest movie of the year for me.*

**tick...tick...boom! - 8/10** 

**C'mon C'mon - 8/10** 
 
**West Side Story - 8/10** - *Confession: I've still never seen the original West Side Story. That being said, this stood very well on its own and was worth the price of the ticket for Ariana DeBose's performance alone. She absolutely shines and dominates every scene she's in. (Zegler and Elgort were great too though). I'd love for her to get an Oscar nomination. The set designs were beautiful and intricate, the musical numbers were catchy, and it was overall a great tribute to Stephen Sondheim just a few weeks after his passing. Had tears in my eyes when his name popped up.*   

**Minari -  8/10**   

**Benedetta- 8/10**  

**Nobody - 8/10** - *This was the first time I'd been back in theaters in over a year and I loved every minute of it. It's ridiculous and basically a remake of John Wick, but being back in a theater was so fun that it gets at least 3 extra points.*  

**Zola - 8/10**  

**Stillwater - 8/10**

**Final Set - 8/10** - *How many tennis movies is too many? Asking for a friend. If King Richard didn't exist, this would be the best one of the year. It's a realistic, grounded, satisfying underdog story. I really liked it.**  

**Shang-Chi Ten Rings - 8/10**    

**The Card Counter - 8/10**     

**A Quiet Place Part 2 - 8/10**    

**Azor - 7/10** - *Vague political ""thriller"" that asks more questions than it answers. It almost veers into intriguing, but ultimately feels like a puzzle missing too many pieces.*	

**Candyman - 7/10** 

**Bergman Island - 7/10**  

**Lamb - 7/10**    

**The Many Saints of Newark - 7/10**   

**Mass - 7/10** - *I'm a big fan of minimalist, one-location movies. Huge emotional payoff, but does take a while to build up to it.*

**The French Dispatch - 7/10** - *One of the most disappointing movies of the year. I was fully expecting this to be top 5 or 10.*

**Black Widow - 7/10**  

**Larry Flynt for President - 7/10** - *Really good documentary. If you've seen the Woody Harrelson movie, you already know about most of this, but it was a great look inside the most fucked up US presidential campaign in history.*    

**House of Gucci - 7/10** - *Thank you, Jared Leto*

**Being the Ricardos - 7/10**     

**The Hand of God - 7/10**

**Who You Think I Am - 7/10** - *Very solid psychological-drama with just the right amount of twists and turns. I tend to like movies that show thee dark side of social media. Fun visuals, good piano-heavy score. Two great drone shots that really stick in my mind. I liked how it gets a bit meta/self-aware. It dragged a bit though and that held it back.*

**Joe Bell - 7/10** 

**The Souvenir Part II** - 7/10   

**Copshop - 7/10**  

**Sing 2  - 7/10** - *I didn't plan for Scarlett Johansson singing U2 being one of the sweetest things I saw this year, but hey, things happen. Sweet movie.*   

**Language Lessons - 7/10**  

**Blue Bayou - 7/10** 

**Encanto - 7/10**    

**The Novice - 6/10** - *This movie was the victim of wayyyyyyy too much editing. It felt more like a music video or a commercial for anxiety medication than a movie. It's marketed as 'Whiplash but on a row boat', but doesn't come close. It's carried by a solid lead performance.*

**The Tragedy of Macbeth - 6/10** - *Look, I know this rating feels wrong and will disqualify my list for a lot of people. I can pretend I loved it but word-for-word Shakespeare adaptions have never really done anything for me. I'm gonna take the easy way out and blame English not being my first language. Grasping 10% of what is being said in a movie just isn't fun, I didn't enjoy this at all. It did look gorgeous and Denzel/Frances were great so points for that, but this was a slog. Easily my least favorite Coen brother movie ever.  This was the last movie I saw in 2021.*

**Free Guy - 6/10** - *Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds, as usual, but this had more emotion than I expected. It was a perfectly okay, fun, dumb movie. About 45 minutes in, every screen at the theater went black at the same time and played audio only for about 20 minutes, so that sucked.* 

**Old - 6/10**    

**Jungle Cruise - 6/10**  

**Cruella - 6/10** -* More of a jukebox comedy-musical than a Disney movie, but Emma Stone as Cruella just makes sense.*     

**In The Heights - 6/10** 

**Wrath of Man - 6/10**  *This year's Den of Thieves. Overly-violent distraction movie that tries to imitate Heat but gets a bit too ridiculous. Pretty fun time at the movies though.*

**Ghostbusters Afterlife - 6/10**  

**National Champions - 6/10**  
     
**Encounter - 6/10**  - *Too predictable.*

**Venom 2 - 6/10**    

**Flag Day - 6/10**

**Those Who Wish Me Dead - 6/10** - *Bloated, dumb, overdramatic. It suffers from 'True Detective Season 2 Syndrome', where a side-event completely overshadows the actual story. Taylor Sheridan has earned a lot of goodwill from Sicario/Hell or High Water, but it's being slowly chipped at with the more recent stuff.*

**The King's Man - 5/10** - *A series of diminishing returns. The first movie was refreshing, the second movie didn't take itself seriously enough, and the third movie took itself way too seriously. The tone is all over the place. It was awkward. The one nonsensical trench-warfare scene was pretty badass.*

**Eternals - 5/10** 

**Fast 9 - 5/10**  

**The Beta Test - 5/10** - *Starts off with a bang but bites off a lot more than it can chew. This movie should have just went full 'Harvey Weinstein satire' but goes way too much into insanity. A few hilarious lines but just too all over the place.* 

**Red Notice - 5/10**    

**The Nowhere Inn - 5/10** - *A movie that's impossible to describe. It's David Lynch meets Tim Heidecker meets mockumentary, which sounds amazing, but it just didn't click for me. I like St Vincent's music though.*

**I'm Your Man - 5/10** - *Like *Toni Erdmann* a few years ago, this is another critically-acclaimed German comedy that just didn't do anything for me. Not very funny, not very sweet. It was fine.

**Mortal Kombat - 5/10**  

**France - 4/10** - *Lea Seydoux was great (as always), but it was very disjointed and one of the most tonally-confusing movies I've ever seen. The satire didn't bite hard enough and the drama was anticlimactic. Not really any laughs and it felt like 3 different movies. It felt like a toothless Armando Iannucci movie.* 

**The Electrical Life Louis Wain - 4/10** - *Once or twice a year, Amazon will quietly put out a bland Oscar bait biopic and this was one of those. Reminded me of The Aeronauts. Instantly forgotten about before even leaving the theater* 

**Space Jam: A New Legacy - 4/10** 

**Wife of a Spy - 4/10** - *Performances were solid but it was way too slow. Too ""clean"" for a WW2 movie, reminded me of Allied.  The lighting was off-putting, lots of overly-bright and washed-out shots, made it look like a TV movie. Would recommend for anyone into sespionage-dramas, otherwise it's a skip.*

**Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard - 4/10**  

**Snake Eyes - 4/10** - *Dropping this between Mortal Kombat and Shang-Chi was a bad idea.*

**Clifford the Big Red Dog - 4/10** 

**The Addams Family 2 - 3/10** 

**Wolf - 3/10** - *""Let's re-make The Lobster, but a lot worse.""*

**Dont Breathe 2 - 3/10** - *The most miserable experience I had in a theater this year. Dark, mean-spirited, and gross. I remember the first one being a solid thriller, but this was just depressing and bleak. It also looked really cheap.*

**Escape Room: Champions - 3/10** - *This was a classic ""the first movie made a shit ton of money so we have to make a sequel"". It's the definition of a cheap cash grab.*

**Dear Evan Hansen - 2/10** - *This would be the worst movie of the year but I laughed so hard at the scene of Ben Platt's character running away from Kaitlyn Dever in the school hallway that it instantly gave it some points. That was honestly the funniest scene of any movie this year, albeit unintentionally. I'm sure if I wasn't the only person in the theater it would have gotten some laughs. It's this year's Cats. Not quite ""so bad it's good"", but almost. Julianne Moore's autotuned singing scene was painful.*

**The Unknown Saint - 2/10** 

**Cry Macho - 1/10** - *I don't think I've ever felt as much second-hand embarrassment as I did watching this (except since Clint Eastwood had a threesome in The Mule, I think?).  The acting was mentally & physically painful to watch and every situation was extremely cliché. One of the most poorly-written movies I've ever seen. It felt like really bad improv, like the actors had never even met before the cameras started rolling. I didn't think Eastwood could make a worse movie than 15:17 to Paris, but he did. I almost fell asleep a few times, it's possibly the worst road trip movie of all time. Just skip this, even if you're a hardcore Clint Eastwood fan (he just growls and has weird, alien-like interactions for 100 minutes). I rarely give a score this low but it was earned.*

venom2,venom sequel,q2is27,James Bond and Venom are no match for the Chinese military.," Lots of great (and well deserved) coverage in the trades and here on about the phenomenal success of “No Time To Die” at the UK and elsewhere overseas, and plenty of equally positive news too about “Venom: Let There Be Carnage” outperforming all other COVID releases in the US over its opening weekend.

But there’s one simple fact not getting anywhere near the same amount of coverage, which the screen grab below from Screen Daily highlights simply and succinctly: by far the most popular film at cinemas around the world last weekend was released in just one country, the world’s leading box office market, China.

#Notable Box Office Stories

* The first *Venom* film exceeded expectations when it opened to just over $80 million in October 2018 (/u/mi-16evil [wrote about it at the time](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9meaoh/box_office_week_venom_smashes_the_october_opening/)), but few people could have predicted that the sequel **Venom: Let There Be Carnage** would not only surpass the opening weekend box office of its predecessor but do so during a time when cinemas worldwide are seeing reduced admissions across the board. *Let There Be Carnage* opened to $90.1 million this weekend, setting a new box office record for an opening during the COVID-19 pandemic; the previous record-holder was *Black Widow* which opened to $80.8 million in July - but with a simultaneous theatrical and Disney+ release, whereas *Let There Be Carnage* was an exclusively theatrical release. Note that LTBC surprisingly is *not* the first sequel released during the pandemic to outperform its predecessor - that would be *Space Jam 2* whose opening weekend outperformed the opening weekend of the first *Space Jam* film by approximately $3.5 million.

* The first weekend of October appears to have been an excellent time in recent years for films to open - because alongside the impressive 2018 opening weekend of the first *Venom* film, we have *Joker* opening in 2019 with $93.5 million (/u/mi-16evil [wrote about it at the time](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/deelod/box_office_week_joker_opens_to_1_with_a/)) and setting the record for an opening weekend during the month of October (a record which it still holds). Although *Let There Be Carnage* faces some stiff competition in the remainder of October from the likes of *No Time To Die* and *Dune*, it does have one notable advantage in that LTBC has a very short runtime (97 minutes) compared to the 150+ minute runtimes of the two aforementioned films; it may be that cinemas can choose to schedule more showtimes for *Venom* per day than for the longer films. Either way, with this weekend's record-breaking performance, I'm sure if Eddie Brock was reading this writeup there would only be one logical way to celebrate the good news. [\*happy lobster-eating noises*](https://i.imgur.com/UAAL0ht.gifv)

* **The Many Saints of Newark**, a prequel film to the legendary TV series *The Sopranos*, grossed $5 million during its opening weekend. Although HBO MAX numbers are yet to be released, many speculated that the film's simultaneous theatrical and HBO MAX release may have caused it to be a film watched primarily on the streaming service - especially given the fact that many fans of *The Sopranos* would already be HBO MAX subscribers, and be more accustomed to watching Sopranos content on TV than at the cinema. Other recent Warner Brothers victims at the box office include *Cry Macho* and *Malignant*, both of which were also released to HBO MAX the same day and both of which failed to gross over $6 million during their respective opening weekends.

* The latest James Bond film **No Time To Die** opened in over 50 international markets, including the UK, this weekend and grossed a total of $119.1 million worldwide. This is the first film to be released during the COVID-19 pandemic to cross the $100 million threshold in international markets during its opening weekend, but without a release in China (it opens there at the end of October). In the UK, the film opened to $34.8 million this weekend - surpassing the UK opening weekend box office of *Skyfall* ($32.4 million) to be the largest three-day weekend in the history of the series (and the sixth-largest opening weekend in the UK of all time). *Spectre* opened on a Monday (the same night as its premiere at the Royal Albert Hall) so its numbers were ""higher"" but reflect an entire week's performance (source: [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2015/11/spectre-box-office-record-opening-uk-1201601884/)).

* **Dune** opened in over 30 international markets in mid-September and crossed the $100 million threshold this week, with $10 million of that coming from IMAX screenings. According to [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2021/10/no-time-to-die-james-bond-dune-venom-let-there-be-carnage-china-global-international-box-office-1234848712/), the top five markets for *Dune* to date are France ($18.6M - [and it has been #1 three weekends in a row](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/q0gp19/dune_reigns_for_the_3rd_weekend_in_a_row_in/)), Russia ($18.1M), Germany ($13.4M), Spain ($6.9M) and Italy ($6.7M). The film opens in the US and Canada on October 22.

* Other notable stories... after dominating the September box office, **Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings** crossed the $200 million threshold domestically this week, becoming the first film to be released during the COVID-19 pandemic to do so. It is also the first film to cross this threshold in a single calendar month since late 2019, when *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* was the last to do so. **Titane**, the winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival this year, opened in over 560 cinemas in North America this weekend to gross a total of $515,000 - the largest domestic opening for any Palme d'Or winner since Michael Moore's *Fahrenheit 9/11* in 2004.

venom2,venom sequel,nzwunk,"What are some movies you want a sequel of, that currently has none and likely never will?","I still want a sequel to Spider-Man 3, with Sam Raimi at the helm with Sony backing the picture. I can say I am 0% excited for Venom 2 and the actual Spider-Man 3 Sony/Marvel are releasing.

I also want a Pulp Fiction 2, as I recently rewatched this and it is probably my favorite QT movie, more than Kill Bill Vol 1 now.

Princess Bride 2 with the same principal cast would be cool. I never got into this movie and almost gave up on this, but watched it thoroughly last week and it's good.

Bill & Ted 4 with Thea and Billy being the main stars, with Bill and Ted being supporting cast members.

Man of Steel 2 would be appreciated. BvS is technically a sequel to MoS, but back in 2013-2014, I think Zack wanted a to do a sequel, but WB wanted to add Batman.",0,84,1623704326.0,2021-06-14 21:58:46,True

venom2,venom sequel,myjrjg,I will summarize the movie Mortal Kombat without knowing anything about it.,"So the movie begins in the feudal japan, where a samurai is living the dream with his family in the woods. He kisses his wife in the forehead and tells her how much he loves her and I’m like “wow, you so dead already?” and the movie didn’t disappoint me there, only took 30 seconds for her to be slain by some sort of ice cream ninja.

So the samurai wants to avenge his family, and he argues with him in Japanese, but he’s Chinese, the samurai tells him he doesn’t understand a word. So the ninja, who also speaks Japanese, replies back in English and kills the samurai.

A long time later, we meet this guy Cole, he’s a fighter, not a very good one. He fights for food, shampoo or anything he’s offered. His daughter is his cornerman, who looks older than both his parents. While he’s inside a neck crank she tells him not to surrender, seems she wants her heritage quick.

Then this black guy with a creepy 80s moustache saves them from the ice cream ninja. But the ninja blows up both his arms. You know when a beer gets stuck in the back of the freezer, and you’re too stubborn to let it go, unload everything and try again? Yeah, your hand gets cold, and also the beer is frozen so it explodes when you open it.

So Cole meets Sonya (whose name is the easiest to remember from the whole thing), she seems pissed, she was about to begin a BDSM session in her living room with an aussie hobbo. She keeps asking where the black guy is, guess she was expecting a threesome.

She explains to Cole his mark is an invitation to a tournament called Mortal kombat, where they’ll need to fight to the death. Thank god Cole dedicated his life to martial arts, imagine he ended up a lawyer or as an apple store salesman, what a waste.

They get attacked by some reptilian creature that spits venom: “Vaccines cause autism” “the earth is flat” that kind of shit. The aussie hobbo summons his inner Steve Irwin and goes “look at the size of that thing… I’m gonna pet it”.

They have to get to some temple but the only one who knows its location is the aussie hobbo. They offer him their pocket money and let him fulfill his request of cumming on the garden gnome as a part of the deal. As he failed his driving test for the 7th time, he asks her auntie if she can drive him and his friends there. Apparently wasn’t his favourite auntie and she leaves them about 20 miles away in the middle of the desert with a canteen full of salt.

Then they met a shaolin monk, but he has hair. He said he was given the task to find earth’s champions. How long ago was this? 30 min? you only went 20 feet from the main entrance, and now one of the champions is a log.

They reach the temple which had some very cool concept art, but the movie was on a budget and they could only afford a cave. There’s this weird piece of tech atrezzo that someone’s son did. It’s like a giant glowing anal bead, and they seem very proud of it because they show it a lot of times even though it doesn’t fit at all.

They meet Chinese Thor, but he’s a jerk. He says in order to have an opportunity they have to unlock their inner power. The aussie becomes cyclops but Cole can’t do shit, even though they tingle his g-spot and everything, so he quits and goes back with his family. Oh, and by the way, they’ve fixed the armless guy by nailing two forks onto his severed limbs, one longer than the other. “Yeah, it will do”.

So the baddies show up, apparently the aussie hobbo has betrayed them for a real job and two big macs. They throw the fork guy in there like “go get some wins champ” against a massive guy with a sledgehammer. An they keep wondering why they’re loosing.

The villain is and old lady in a dressing gown who feasts on the souls of the young people. Just like my mother in law. His followers are emo flash, a flying junkie and a dentist’s dream.

There’s this guy who went professional at throwing frisbee and shows the flying junkie the reason you’d never stick your tongue into the ceiling fan.

Meanwhile Cole gets ambushed by Machamp, which unlocks his inner power which is literal plot armor made from repurposed basketballs. He just stand there and absorbs damage like Homer Simpson’s boxing career. It is very OP, pls nerf.

Chinese Thor interrupts the brawl right after grandma kills the frisbee superstar and banished them all into outer space. Which would have been neat for him to do right when they showed up. The fork guy got a new pair of swiss army arms by buying winrar.

Chinese Thor teleports the good guys to a purgatory where they’re safe and can’t be reached (again, why he didn’t take them there in the first place? Because he’s a jerk I told you!). They plan to win by diving their enemies, which makes sense, by dividing themselves, which made no sense at all. Why not 4v1 everybody? These guys don’t follow the rules in the first place.

Anyways, the swiss army arms guy smashes the sledgehammer guy’s head right before he was about to say his first line of dialogue. Sonya kills the aussie, who had been carrying the whole film in his back, with the garden gnome because karma is a bitch and then goes help Cole because somehow after killing the 1600lbs 10ft tall 9-times champ monster, he struggles to put out the girl with weird teeth.

Cole then gets dragged out by the ice cream ninja who apparently kidnapped his family. They look very dead to me, but apparently because they’re fresh frozen they’re safe from dying from hypothermia later. Cole’s ancestor comes to aid from hell, he’s now fire ninja, and pokemon taught me ice cream ninja is no match for him.

We’re 80 min deep in the movie and these two keeps saying these things “for the Shirayariu” “for the lin koei” which I have no clue what they mean. Heck, I don’t even know why they hate each other in the first place. Anyways, the ice cream ninja becomes roasted duck and then the old lady in pajamas begans to threaten the audience with a sequel.

The ending scene is what kills the joy for me. After a career full of bad written dialogues and terrible one liners, Cole Young gets a shot to star at Hollywood. How? It is still a mystery to me bigger than when he learned perfect Japanese in South Chicago.

venom2,venom sequel,koncqx,Netflix has too many Christmas movies. I watched 20 of them this December,"My significant other and I found ourselves with a lot of time on our hands this Christmas, and since we both love Christmas movies we decided to watch as many of them as we could on Netflix. Some of them are old classics, others are new classics, others are pretty mediocre fluff, and still others are hot garbage. Inspired by [this post, rating Nicolas Cage DTV movies,](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/ffyvir/nicolas_cage_made_29_directtovideo_movies_in_the/) I decided to rate/review every one we saw. Here they are, in no particular order

&#x200B;

**Let It Snow - 5/10**  Based on a John Green book, and it's probably way better as a book. There's just too many storylines to follow and not enough screentime to properly develop any of them, so every character arc is a bare-bones YA stereotype: the guy trying to throw a cool party realizes the cool was in his heart all along, the guy in love with his best friend finally works up the courage to make out with her, the cool one who's secretly lonely finds a friend, etc. Super predictable, but still made me feel warm & fuzzy inside. +1 for the tinfoil hat lady.

&#x200B;

**The 12 Pups of Christmas - 1/10**  The acting is terrible and the plot makes zero sense, but this is a Hallmark movie so that's par for the course; what really ruins this movie is how unlikeable the main character is. She delivers every other line with a venom that does NOT fit a brightly colored, Hallmark Christmas movie about puppies. Would have been a 0/10 but the pups are just too darn cute

&#x200B;

**The Princess Switch - 6/10**   When a Christmas romance movie has ALL the tropes, it has to find a balance between taking itself lightly enough that the tropes don't feel generic and boring, while still taking itself seriously enough that the audience can feel good about getting invested in the story. *The Princess Switch* walks this line really well, and I was surprised how much I liked it.

As with all Christmas romance movies, the plot is a juuuust little contrived (Vanessa Hudgens gets inspired to compete in an international baking competition after running into her ex-boyfriend, then happens to run into her doppelganger who is also a princess of a small european country with a Christmas-based culture and economy) But once you get past the exposition, a heart-warming love story ensues, with enough sincerity to make you forget about the dumber plot points. Solid movie.

&#x200B;

**A Christmas Prince - 5/10**  *A Christmas Prince* leans a bit too far in the other direction. It is probably the most formulaic Christmas movie I've seen: girl with a kickass fun job in NY gets to go to a Christmas Kingdom for Christmas, and falls in love with a prince when she's not supposed to. Ditzy Mary-Sue protagonist who is somehow always right when the plot wants her to be? Check. Prince who's not sure he wants the responsibility of being king, but has his mind changed by *love*? Check. A palace intrigue in which the clear villain (the only character with dark hair) tries to steal the throne? Check check check! This movie has it all. And unlike The Princess Switch, A Christmas Prince plays it completely straight, which I think hurts it a little. But in the end, the movie knows what it is and delivers, which is more than I can say for its sequels. (We'll get to those later and hoooo boy are they something. hold onto your pants)

&#x200B;

**Christmas With a Prince - 0/10**  I think this is supposed to be a children's movie that Netflix forgot to label as such. The sets are all brightly multi-colored, the comedy is either slapstick or that weird brother-sister dynamic that you used to see on low-budget Disney channel originals, and every plot point is spoon fed to you so plainly that you can almost hear your mother making airplane noises. This movie wasn't just bad, it was so specifically bad that I'm pretty sure it's literally meant for children aged 8-14. But I watched the entire thing for you, the people. This post better get some upvotes.

&#x200B;

**A Muppet Christmas Carol - 11/10**   A true classic that I cheated in order to watch (I don't believe its on Netflix, but I had to see it).  I've seen this before when I was a kid, and watching it again it amazes me how good this is. Not only are the muppets their usual combination of funny and heartwarming, but their goofiness is perfectly offset by some chilling musical numbers and a truly gut-wrenching performance by Michael Caine. I honestly don’t know how he did this while surrounded by muppets the whole time, but he sells the more emotional scenes SO well.

This movie has been inducted into the ""re-watch every year"" tier. If you haven't seen it, you should.

&#x200B;

**The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show - 8/10**  Cheating a little on this one too, since its on Amazon Prime and not Netflix, but my significant other and I both love Kacey Musgraves too much to not watch this. It brings a nice retro touch to a year that desperately needed it, and it balances some classic, cheesy Christmas numbers with some dry segments in-between courtesy of Dan Levy. Also contains an original song, ""Christmas Always Makes Me Cry"", that fucking wrecks me every time I hear it. Its SO GOOD

&#x200B;

**The Princess Switch 2: The Switchening - 3/10**   A hot mess that does not take itself seriously enough. Part of the fairytale ending from the original is destroyed in the exposition so that we can get a new and improved fairytale ending, except with an EVEN MORE contrived plot to get there, and a key character played by a different actress. Every fun gimmick from the original is dialed up to 11, and it's so over-the-top that it sort of clashes with the more sincere, lovey-dovey, happily-ever-after vibe that they're simultaneously going for. But it IS pretty funny, in a sort of 'so-bad-it's-good' way.

If you have access to Netflix and don't want to watch the whole movie, just jump to 39:14. This one line had me rolling for a solid 5 minutes.

**The Knight Before Christmas - 1/10**  Apparently when Vanessa Hudgens saw critics saying that the plot to *The Princess Switch* was a bit much, she went ""they think *that* was contrived? Watch this!"" and then made this movie as an elaborate prank. At least I think that's what happened, because I have no other convincing explanation for how this movie got made.

&#x200B;

**A Christmas Prince 2: The Royal Wedding - 2/10**   In the second installment of the Christmas Prince series, the central conflict involves our Mary Sue becoming uncomfortable with the uptight restrictions of royal life, and wishing more people would take her opinion on the Aldovian economic crisis seriously rather than relegate her to wedding planning.

This one is just as basic as the original. However, because Mary Sue is already with the prince, the plot doesn't have a love story to lean on, and instead revolves around Mary Sue miraculously solving the economic crisis by discovering a sinister plot to undermine the government's economic initiatives. It's a weirdly boring intrigue for a Christmas movie, thrown into the foreground by the lack of a love story, and made even worse by the additions of comic relief characters Rudy and Sahil, whose entire schtick is just very exaggerated accents (and also Sahil being flamboyantly gay?) I know it's a Christmas movie and your audience is predominantly white, but come on. This movie was made in 2018, I thought we all agreed that was no longer an acceptable punchline.

&#x200B;

**A Christmas Prince 3: The Royal Baby - 1/10**   This movie introduced me to the Netflix Christmas Cinematic Universe, or NCU. It turns out that the Christmas Kingdom from this series, Aldovia, shares a border with the Christmas Kingdom of Belgravia, from the *Princess Switch* series. Aldovia's closest ally, however, is a nation called Penglia, and the third installment of the series sees Mary Sue try her hand at diplomatic relations when the royal family of Penglia comes to re-sign a centuries old treaty as is tradition. The plot is just as tiresome as *The Royal Wedding:* there's more palace intrigue, Mary Sue solves the case, etc. The exaggerated accents for comedy continue, with Rudy (Mary Sue's very Italian father who sounds like if pizza could talk) accounting for more of it this time. This does not make it any better.

In addition to the bad plot and movie, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the universe makes no sense. Penglia looks like the geographical equivalent of Georgia or Armenia (at least according to this map from the movie which bears a striking resemblence to how Europe looks in real life), but the Penglians in the movie are played by British Asian actors and bear traditionally Chinese? names. Also, there is still a New York City and a Chicago in this universe, so what happened in the past to get Europe to this state that would still allow for the formation of America? Do Great Britain and France exist in this universe? Does Italy exist, and if not, where did Rudy learn to make that food? More importantly, does Germany exist? If not, where does this Christmas culture displayed in the Christmas Kingdoms come from? Did either world war happen? Did Aldovia and Belgravia fight for the Axis in World War II?! I'm thinking about this too much, but I wish Netflix had thought about it just a little more.

&#x200B;

**Holidate - 4/10**  Not good at all. Rather than go for the cheesy and heartwarming type of rom-com, Holidate goes for a more laugh-out-loud, raunchy style of comedy. This *can* work, as evidenced by *National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,* but you need good comedic actors/actresses in order to deliver that type of comedy properly. Unfortunately, neither Emma Roberts nor Larry Hemsworth can really measure up to anyone in *Christmas Vacation*'s cast, and so a lot of the more ambitious bits (like the pants-shitting scene or the finger scene) fall really flat. And with no warm, fuzzy feels to rescue it, those comedic failures are right at the forefront and make the movie hard to enjoy.

To rant a bit further, the casting for this movie is real weird. When trying for this type of comedy, it's bad enough to cast Emma Roberts (who plays the same jaded emotionless character in everything she does from *We're the Millers* to *American Horror Story* to *Little Italy*) alongside a relatively unknown Australian soap/action star with no comedy chops. But they also cast a talented SNL player, Alex Moffat, as the straightest of straight men in this movie, and THEN opt to cast a Vine star in a more comedic role. None of it makes sense, and it's just a mess.

&#x200B;

**Klaus - 10/10**   Incredible. I don't even know if I've ever seen a movie about the origin of Santa Claus before, but this movie has everything. Stunning animation, great character development for multiple characters, J.K. Simmons, and a heartwarming message about the spirit of good and giving. It hits especially hard right now, at a time in the world where it seems like everything is terrible; it's really nice to see a movie not only reminding us that Christmas is a time for giving, but that giving MEANS something, and can help make the world a better place.

I'll be watching this movie every year as well. It's that good.

&#x200B;

**The Christmas Chronicles - 7/10**  I'm kind of a sucker for movies with a more down-to-earth, human depiction of Santa Claus. The Christmas Chronicles delivers a pretty funny action flick starring Kurt Russell as Santa who has to interact with the normal world on Christmas Eve in order to fix his sleigh, recover his magic Santa mojo, and save Christmas. The kids are walking stereotypes (awful teen with daddy issues and too-cute little sister who still believes in Santa)  but in the end it doesn't matter because Kurt Russell steals the show.

&#x200B;

I really appreciated how his depiction of Santa was more human and less whimsical, without losing any of his Christmas spirit; it's a tough balance to pull off in these sorts of movies (see *The Santa Clause*  for an example of a lesser actor definitely NOT pulling it off)

&#x200B;

**Get Santa - 8/10**  I mentioned how I'm a sucker for a down-to-earth Santa? I'm also a huge sucker for ""Bad Santa who is totally done with everyone's bullshit"" tropes. It resembles *The Christmas Chronicles* in many ways, and probably inspired many elements of it, but with the addition of a really dry sort of humor that contrasts very well with the cheesy cheer you'd normally see in a Christmas movie (I think it's a British thing? I get *Death at a Funeral* vibes and I think that's one of the best comedies ever made).

&#x200B;

**The Christmas Chronicles Part Two: Electric Boogaloo - 6/10**  This movie is a real testament to why its important to keep things simple. The original works because there's only one major plot driver - Santa lost his mojo and needs to get it back. There's no weird villain with a crazy backstory, no awful CGI elves, and no convoluted origin story for aforementioned elves. All of these weird distractions really take away from part two, but in the end it's still got the core that made the original fun to watch: Kurt Russell's badass Santa saving Christmas (with the new addition of Goldie Hawn as Mrs. Claus which really works well). No movie that starts with Santa *hunting a giant saber-toothed lynx* can be bad, come on now

&#x200B;

**The Holiday Calendar - 5/10**  An un-focused mess with a fun little love triangle, magical advent calendar, and Ron Cephas Jones. A lot of the side characters' motivations throughout the movie remain a mystery (why does her boss randomly fire her? Why does her love interest remain shy despite his incredible looks? Why is her short-term fling a douche one minute, but a sweetie the next? We may never know). But in the end it's sweet, and unlike most Christmas romance movies, the leads are actually attractive this time, so +1 for that

&#x200B;

**Christmas Catch - 3/10**  A Christmas action flick that doesn't really bring the cheer as much as one might like.  It's not terrible, but it definitely felt like another one of those shitty action flicks that just had a Christmas label slapped onto it at the end for marketability, which I didn't appreciate.

&#x200B;

**Jingle Jangle - 5/10**  This was the last one we saw, and it was the biggest disappointment of the entire month for me, because I was *so sure it would be amazing* and it turned out to be just OK. A diverse cast that includes Forrest Whitaker?  and Keegan Michael Key as a showboaty villain (the kind of role I think he was born to play)??  singing musical numbers about toymaking produced by John Legend??? set in a *magical steampunk world* ???!?!?!? Maybe I hyped it up too much in my head, but this had SO MUCH potential and squandered maybe of 70% of it.

The musical numbers are really underwhelming once you get past the visuals. The choreo is incredible, the set design is incredible, and the voices singing the songs are really good, but the songs themselves are very repetitive and uninspiring, to the point that once you get past verse 1 + chorus you can and should fast forward through the next 3 minutes. If you saw this movie and thought the songs were good, try looking up the lyrics on genius and reading them with no music or visuals, and see if you still disagree with me.

I also strongly disliked how they interwove the magic system with math; if you want to be whimsical, *don't include math.* The ""square root of impossible"" does not equal a person; because square roots are a real thing, and they aren't magic. Why not just make the magic *magical?* Why do there have to be equations involved? It looks pretty when they're writing in the air, but in the end it doesn't make sense.

And that's really the theme of the movie: It's two full hours of stunning visuals, but take the tiniest peek behind those aesthetics, and you'll see it's all sizzle and no steak. And it sucks because I feel like if they just cut it down to 90 minutes, removed the math, and played only like 5 or 6 musical numbers but made them lyrically creative, the movie could have been a 12/10. I *really really* wanted to like Jingle Jangle, but it wasn't all the way there. ",10,8,1609549246.0,2021-01-02 01:00:46,True
venom2,venom sequel,koc4wf,Nearly 500 movies since March,"Tldr: my wife saw almost 500 new movies this year. 

Hello r/movies, it’s been a crazy year hasn’t it... Theaters are closed, production has (for the most part) ground to a halt and what was scheduled for release has moved to a streaming service or was delayed to next year or both. With the initial quarantine back in March starting I decided to take this unprecedented opportunity to give my wife the catch-up she desperately needed since she didn’t watch very many movies growing up. 

A little backstory, she grew up in a home where many movies were forbidden for religious reasons and as a result just never became a cinephile. She saw many Disney movies and a few random others but missed a vast majority of cinemas best (and worst). On the flip side I grew up near a regular theater and a dollar theater and saw a ton of films as a kid and teen, I’d regularly go on weekends or skip school for a triple feature or catch the last showing of something every night of the week. 

We’ve been together for almost 11 years now and she would go see anything and everything with me. All the Marvel movies, action comedies, sci fi, animation, whatever... but her movie knowledge is fairly contained within the last decade. So when I got laid off and she began working from home we decided to see how many new movies we could see during this Covid mess. 

We defined “New” as anything we had both never seen or anything she had never seen and I hadn’t seen in 10+ years since we met. Since mid March we have managed to watch 500 movies and in the process learn a few things about her individual tastes and the kinds of movies we enjoy watching as a couple the most.

I’ve noticed that my wife seems to prefer old movies to new ones (overall). Some Like It Hot became an instant favorite for her... She also loved seeing things like Freaks or the Hitchcock films that get referenced a lot. She’s like Captain America pointing out all the references she gets now. We also found out she loves James Bond (mostly older ones), she doesn’t hate Will Farrell as much as she thought (or at all really), she loves bad/old/obscure movies, scary movies aren’t as scary as she thought they’d be, and that she’s basically Jennifer Anniston’s character from Office Space with her crazy love for old Kung Fu. 

As far as random recommendations my wife wanted to shout out all the Falcon films, Our Man Flint and In Like Flint, and Tammy & The T-Rex. I wanted to shout out The Forbidden Kingdom, Dr Goldfoot and The Bikini Girls & Dr Goldfoot and The Girl Bombs, and Old Dracula. If anybody wants to just talk movies I always welcome 

I can’t wait to expand her movie history in this coming year, there’s always plenty of bad obscure movies but now that she is into it it’s time to bring out the heavy hitters. Godfather, Jaws, Alien, Citizen Cane, Clockwork Orange, 2001 A Space Odyssey and more are still in the pipeline... If you’re still with me here I want to sincerely thank you for reading about our journey this year. I love you r/movies, and I hope y’all have a wonderfully cinematic 2021.",7,4,1609511397.0,2021-01-01 14:29:57,True
venom2,venom sequel,iemvmx,My guide to understanding Metacritic scores,"Apparently there's some weird fanboy panic over ""Tenent"" scoring 71/100 on Metacritic, despite the fact that Christopher Nolan's other movies:  Insomnia (78/100), Batman Begins (70/100), The Prestige (66/100), Inception (74/100), Dark Knight Rises (78/100), Interstellar (74/100).    A movie that scores in the 70s represents widespread approval and is well in line with what you can expect from a typical Nolan blockbuster.  Rarely regarded as critically acclaimed masterpieces (really only Dunkirk scored over 90), but always well-liked.  Compare that to a director like Zack Snyder who has literally never made a movie that's scored over 59/100.  Most of his movies end up in the 40s.  His movies still have a fandom regardless. 

I didn't understand this panic. I saw u/AaronWYL make a comment that I think summed it up:

> **Seems like the gamer mentality spilling over into movies.** For a long time now in gaming anything below a 9 is unacceptable for a beloved top tier game. A game being rated 7...shit, you might as well throw it in the garbage.

I hadn't considered this and I think he nailed it.  You see, back in the day when we'd open up a newspaper to look at a movie review, movies would often be scored on a 4 star scale.  This continues today.  A movie might score 3/4 stars and you'd go ""oh damn, that sounds like it's going to be great"".   Another might score 2.5/4 stars and you'd go ""oh, that sounds like mixed reviews, but above average... maybe I'll give it a shot."" 

**Quick note on RottenTomatoes vs Metacritic.**  The standard ""tomatometer"" kind of sucks.  All it's showing is the percentage of critics that didn't completely hate a movie.  They convert all scores to a ""thumbs up/thumbs down"" and tell you what percentage didn't give it thumbs down.  Metacritic, on the flip side, converts every score to a 1/100 scale (regardless of it's a 4 star scale, a A-F scale, a 1-10 scale, etc) and tries to average it out.   If literally every critic scored a movie 2.5 out of 4 stars, the Tomatometer would call that ""100% certified fresh!"" while metacritic would call that 62.5/100.   Rotten tomatoes literally doesn't show you critical consensus.  Metacritic at least makes an attempt, and I've always appreciated it for that.

So yeah... that 3 star movie = 75/100.    That 2 star movie = 50/100.   Quite different than a video game where they pretty much always rate things on a 1/100 scale initially and anything rated under 80 would raise red flags.

**Here's how I look at metacritic scores for movies:**

* 90-100:  This is likely some kind of masterpiece.  These are rare.  Some of the greatest movies of all time score in this range.  

* 80-100:  Most Oscar contenders score in the 80s.  If a movie clears 80, it represents widespread critical acclaim.  Basically must-see.

* 70-80:  This still represents very favorable reviews (think 3 out of 4 stars).  Most of the very best Marvel movies score in this range.  Guardians of the Galaxy (78), Thor Ragnorok (74), Captain America Civil War (75).  Nolan's movies mostly fall in this range.   A widespread broad audience should enjoy movies here regardless of genre.  For instance, I hate the Horror genre, but I'll show up for a Horror movie that scores in this range (such as ""Cabin in the Woods"" and ""Invisible Man""... both of which scored 72/100 and I ended up liking)   

* 60-70:  Ok, these movies are still pretty decent, but if you HATE the genre, you might want to avoid it.  I hate horror movies, so I'm probably avoiding a horror in this range.  I love super-hero movies so when ""Ant-Man"" scores 64/100 I know I'll probably dig it... but if you find that genre childish, you might want to skip it.  Hate dumb action flicks?  Maybe avoid Hobbs & Shaw (60/100), but otherwise you'll probably enjoy it.

* 50-60:  This is the range where if it's your favorite genre, you may still love it.  Big Snyder fanboy?  You might come away thinking ""Man of Steel"" (55/100) is perfect for you.  Love comedy horror?  ""Happy Death Day"" (58/100) is right in your wheelhouse.  Can't get enough of Sci-Fi?  ""Alita: Battle Angel"" (53/100) might end up your favorite movie of the year.  If these aren't your genre... you might kinda hate these films.

* 40-50:  This is the range that I'd recommend totally avoiding unless it's your favorite genre or you're already obsessed with the characters.   ""Batman v Superman 44/100"".   ""Justice League"" 45/100.  ""Suicide Squad"" 40/100.   Most will think they are trash, but if you ride or die for movies Snyder touches, you'll probably defend them to the death.  I'm a big comedy fan... so I'm down with watching a stupid comedy in this range.  ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" (44/100) is dumb as hell, but I love the genre so I dug it.

* 30-40:  Yikes territory.  Unless you're like... ALL ABOUT this genre, you probably will think it sucks.  Like... Sorry, but ""Venom"" (35/100) sucked, but if you can't get enough of Superhero movies, you might come away enjoying it.   The Dumb and Dumber sequel (36/100) was trash, but I'm all about Jim Carrey movies so I was totally fine with it.   Totally obsessed with scifi fantasy adventure family movies... maybe you'll find something redeemable in ""Artemis Fowl"" (31/100)

* 0-30 - Some of the worst movies ever made.  Avoid unless you're willing to do a lot of drugs beforehand.  That said, taste is subjective regardless of consensus quality.  I once went on a couple movie dates with a girl who couldn't stop laughing during ""The Love Guru"" (24/100), but hated ""Wall-E"" (95/100). It totally changed how I saw her as a person, but people are gonna like what they are gonna like.


Anyways... sounds like this latest Nolan movie is pretty good.  Can't wait to see it.",22,17,1598118331.0,2020-08-22 18:45:31,True
venom2,venom sequel,gkwu6z,Will hollywood movies become extinct by 2025?,"A lot of sequels/franchises seem to be coming to an end by 2024. 

Assuming jurassic world will have 2 more films, one will come out in 2021 and one probably in 2024. After that I doubt there will be another jurassic movie.

FF 9 will come out in 2021 and FF 10 in 2023. I doubt there will be another FF movie.

MI 7 and MI8 will be out in 2022 and 2023. will there be another one after that? I doubt so.

Venom 3 and 4 in 2022 and 2024 respectively. I doubt there will be another one after that.

There might be another james bond in 2024. After that, I don't think so.

There will be one more incredibles and minions movie. I doubt there will be another one after that.

Avatar 2 and 3 and 4 in 2021, 2023 and 2025. Will there be another avatar movie after that?

So...by 2025 all franchises could come to an end. What will be left is small budgeted movies. I doubt people will go to movie theaters to watch them. VR headsets will become good by then that people will prefer watching them directly OTT on those headsets.",0,24,1589644207.0,2020-05-16 16:50:07,True

venom2,venom sequel,g5ytbk,Venom (2018) had massive potential!,"With the news dropping regarding the new Venom sequel and it's title, it got me thinking about the first film. The more I think about it and watch clips from it, the more I've realised how amazing that film could have been. Before I start don't get me wrong I still enjoyed the first film!  

It's general knowledge by now that a lot of the initial script and scenes that we're shot ended up being left out of the final cut and that these scenes were ""some of Tom Hardy's favourite parts of the film"". This makes sense to me if you think about the films that Tom Hardy makes and the scripts he choses to be a part of. 

Hardy has a great track record for picking not only interesting scripts but also picking really interesting characters from Bane in The Dark Knight Rises and Max in Mad Max:Fury Road to John Fitzgerald in The Revenant, Forrest Bondurant in Lawless and Tommy Conlon in Warrior. The list goes on but I can't help but think that the Eddie Brock that Hardy read in the script was a much more complicated and interesting character than what we saw on screen. 

My second point is just regarding the R rating which I think most people agree on when we say the film would have worked better with a hard R rating. I get that all comic book films can't be R rated and that Sony made a calculated choice, especially since the film still earned 850 million. But again just watching some of the badass fight and action scenes I can't help but think how awesome and more importantly fitting to the story it could have been watching Venom do some serious damage. It would have hammered down how dangerous this character was instead of portraying that he only ever knocks guys unconscious and slags Eddie all the time. I know he straight up eats a guy in the end but not even a drop of blood in the store? Come on Sony. 

 Anyway, I am excited for the sequel but a little part of me will be thinking watching it could the first film have gone down as gritty gore infested classic like Logan or Deadpool. I mean come on if you're gong to have any complex character fight with his inners demons while leaving a trail of absolute carnage behind him (Yes pun intended) it's going to be Venom.",0,9,1587551810.0,2020-04-22 11:36:50,True

venom2,venom sequel,dh6kwx,My 2020 Worldwide Box Office Predictions,"As 2019 is shaping out to be perhaps the biggest year in box office history, 2020 almost seems like nothing compared to it. This can mainly be pointed to Disney having a relatively weak slate, which is really saying something considering their slates in recent years. As for the other studios, it's all up for grabs, as this will be the first time in the last few years that they have a chance to attempt to match or even dethrone Disney. Below are my predictions for the top 15 films.

1. Black Widow | Disney | $1.20 billion
2. Fast and Furious 9 | Universal | $1.15 billion
3. Minions: The Rise of Gru | Universal | $1.08 billion
4. The Eternals | Disney | $1.06 billion
5. Wonder Woman 1984 | WB | $1.04 billion
6. Tenet | WB | $1.02 billion
7. No Time To Die | MGM | $910 million
8. Mulan | Disney | $820 million
9. Onward | Disney | $760 million
10. Venom II | Sony | $740 million
11. Birds of Prey | WB | $680 million
12. Godzilla vs. Kong | WB| $650 million
13. Jungle Cruise | Disney | $620 million
14. Raya and the Last Dragon | Disney | $540 million
15. Dune | WB | $500 million

So it currently appears that despite Disney probably set to have their weakest year in recent times, they will still dominate the box office list as Black Widow appears to outgross every other film releasing next year. Even though it appears to be the weakest film in Phase 4 in terms of box office, it doesn't seem like any other film is strong enough to overtake it. Coming off her major role in Avengers: Endgame, the biggest film in history, and the fact that Marvel fans would have waited almost a year for a new MCU film, it seems like Black Widow will be the highest grossing film of 2020. As for the second Marvel film releasing next year, The Eternals, it looks like Kevin Feige will have another franchise in a franchise with the introduction of a slew of new characters. The Marvel brand has never been bigger and the promise of insane visuals, Angelina Jolie and the reunion of Jon and Robb almost ensures that the film will pass the billion dollar mark. 

As for Disney's other films for 2020, the live action remake of Mulan should be set to rake in the cash, however, the controversies surrounding it and the exclusion of the greatest Disney character of all time Mushu (/s) will halter the film from reaching the heights of its peers, The Jungle Book, Aladdin and Beauty of the Beast. As for Onward, Pixar have a good track record of delivering, and it seems like the Chris Pratt and Tom Holland animation will be no exception, grossing a similar amount to Pixar's last original film, Coco. As for the animation studio's second film this year Soul, I predict that it will end up being The Good Dinosaur 2.0, where it is overshadowed by another Pixar film that year, a la Finding Dory, which is why it doesn't appear on this list. If this occurs, it would be best for Pixar to just focus on one film a year. Furthermore, Raya and the Last Dragon might be able to make some noise as Disney Animation have had multiple successes in the past such as Frozen, Moana and Zootopia. This is difficult to predict since we haven't seen any promotion for the film yet, but reading the synopsis and considering their track record, just above $500 million seems like a good bet for now. As for Jungle Cruise, the trailer seems promising with Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt looking great in their roles which should allow the film to succeed, but it will likely be far off from the success of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.

Moving on to Warner Brothers, it appears that DC will remain its most consistent inconsistent franchise as both Wonder Woman 1984 and Birds of Prey are blessed with great release dates and should be set to succeed. Wonder Woman 1984 should be able to outgross her first outing if the film is similar in quality and the lack of competition should allow it to break the billion mark. As for Birds of Prey, a Valentine's Day release should allow it to make money, however I don't expect it to outgross 2016's Suicide Squad. Moreover, it is a shame that Godzilla vs. Kong is so low, however, the underperformance of Godzilla: King of the Monsters has left me not nearly as enthusiastic for the film as I was back when Kong: Skull Island kinda overperformed. Despite that, anything above Skull Island's $566 million should be considered decent, but as the Avengers level film for the MonsterVerse, its safe to say that the Kaiju Cinematic Universe is in a pretty shitty position. Now, onto my two most hyped films for 2020, I am particularly biased as I really do hope both Tenet and Dune are great success. Christoper Nolan's next sci-fi action similar to Inception is ready to perform similarly in the box office. Nolan is one of the few names in Hollywood that guarantees box office cash, and it is quite likely that Tenet is able to cross the billion mark. As for Dennis Villeneuve, after Blade Runner 2049 bombed, it can be easy to dismiss Dune's box office chances, but I am particularly optimistic on it doing well thanks to the insane cast and it being a bit more mainstream than BR2049. 

The third major studio, Universal has a similar slate to its summer releases in 2015, and I expect that the sequels to its two highest grossing films that year will perform similarly. The Fast and Furious brand has become quite consistent at hitting a billion, as the last two instalments have, and I expect Furious 9 to be no different. Hobbs and Shaw didn't perform on par but I believe the return of Vin Diesel and Co. and a relatively barren summer will allow for the film to outgross Fast 8. As for the sequel of Minions, the Despicable Me franchise has consistently delivered and once again, The Rise of Gru should be no exception. Every year, theres always one animated film that pops up high in the Top 10, and this film will be this years animation representative.

As for the two films on the list that aren't repped by one of the big 3, James Bond's No Time To Die and Tom Hardy's Venom II should have similar box office returns as their previous instalments. For the former, Spectre numbers are more likely than Skyfall numbers, but the addition of Rami Malek and the simple but fucking banger of a teaser poster and title just makes me optimistic for the film, which is why I believe it will end up in the middle of Craig's last two outings. As for the latter, Venom was one of the biggest surprises in 2018 and I expect its sequel to perform similarly, but I would assume it isn't able to outgross the first one.

Honourable mentions of films that didn't appear include Soul, Top Gun: Maverick, Bad Boys for Life, Dolitte, Free Guy, A Quite Place: Part II, Artemis Fowl, The Conjuring 3, Bloodshot, Death on the Nile, Uncharted and The Croods II. I predict films to all end up between $300 and $500 million, which is the reason why they didn't make the cut.

**TL;DRL:** Even though Disney is going to have its worst year in recent times, it will still fucking dominate over all the other studios in this weak ass year. All hail the House of Mouse.",0,27,1570945064.0,2019-10-13 06:37:44,True

venom2,venom sequel,ctzffx,"In light of the recent Sony/Spider-Man drama, it’s worth looking at Sony’s recent history with franchises (since 2010)","Sony has always been looking to have a stable of franchises - they are in a tough spot compared to other major studios. Only a few of their properties are widely recognized, basically just Spider Man and James Bond. The others are quite a bit more niche, like Hotel Transylvania or Men in Black. The last 10 years are littered with failed franchise attempts, reboots, or squandered opportunities. Here is the state of Sony Pictures since 2010, as told by some of their attempted franchises.

* Men In Black (2012, 2019): Beloved franchise from the early 2000s. Sony’s attempt at #3 ~10-15 years later was not a financial success. Neither was the franchise reboot - a Thor and Valkyrie team-up movie. Sounds good on paper, though! (I had to check to verify that this movie had already come out - yes, it did. Maybe by June 2019 people only wanted Fat Hemsworth.)

* James Bond (2012, 2015): Skyfall’s huge success surprised Sony executives, who scrambled to retain the director (Sam Mendes) for the next Bond movie, and ended up paying gobs of money to bribe him to stay - he wanted a break. His next movie, Spectre, was a critical and commercial disappointment. Until recently the next Bond was still in limbo as an important anniversary year, i.e., normally an easy cash-in opportunity, approaches. 

* Adam Sandler movies (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015): Sandler has moved on to Netflix now, but he had a pretty stunning run of awful movies at Sony (Jack and Jill, Grown Ups, That’s My Boy, Pixels, etc).

* 21 Jump Street (2012, 2014): These movies are great - but where does Sony go from here? Apparently nowhere. Maybe they should have went with the Men In Black crossover after all. 

* Spider-Man (2012, 2014): Like every other studio, after the success of Avengers, Sony was stretching to create a Cinematic Universe. They attempted to spin the Amazing Spider-Man reboot into a Cinematic Universe - but just of spider-man’s villains... However, Amazing Spider-Man 2 couldn’t get its own villains off the ground, and couldn’t match the 1 billion dollar gross that Sony set as a goal (which doesn’t sound too unrealistic today in the midst of the post-Disney-monopalypse billions, but was a terrible miscalculation by Sony executives who expected audiences to show up to a Spider-Man sequel whether or not it was good). In an extremely unusual & humiliating arrangement, Sony canceled its villain movie plans (and its Aunt May standalone spin-off movie - yes, really), and gave Marvel Studios creative control of Spider-Man. Sony would pay production costs of Marvel spider-man stand-alone movies, and any profit from these movies would go to Sony. Marvel can use Spider-Man in its movies as a supporting character with impunity. Sony can still make its own non-MCU movies with other characters from the Spider-Man catalog.

* Total Recall (2012): Remake of beloved-ish? 80s sci-fi action movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger - with Colin Farrell in Arnold’s place. Sounds great to me! But it wasn’t, and it bombed hard. 

* RoboCop (2014): Remake of beloved 80s action movie which was loved for its pulpy violence and political commentary.... remade as a sanitized PG13 meh-fest, and potential franchise starter, that bombed critically and commercially.

* After Earth (2013): Will Smith was like, “Hey Sony - my son is great, give him a job!” Sony said, “Your son is great!” and put him in this movie. They were both wrong.

* 3 Smurfs Movies (2011, 2013, 2017): Maybe these movies are good! I haven’t seen them. I believe Katy Perry is the voice of one of the recurring smurfs, and I like that Justin Timberlake song. So maybe this is a Sony Franchise success. 

* Angry Birds Movie (2016, 2019): Another sony attempt at a franchise starter that didn’t connect with audiences. The recent sequel is now the best-reviewed video game movie of all time! But at this point, Angry Birds is a relic of 2010 and the sequel looks to be a mild flop. 

* Ghostbusters remake (2016): Yet another franchise starter attempt - you know the story on this one. At the time Sony executives were defiant re: the box office numbers, saying, “this movie is a huge success - look at all the free publicity!” But yeah, they’re not making a sequel, because it didn’t make money. They are, however, trying ANOTHER reboot, directed by the original director’s son..... We’ll see. 

* Dark Tower (2017): Attempt at Stephen King franchise that people have been waiting for for decades - when it finally came out it was a huge mess that fizzled hard.

* Jumanji 2 (2017): At the time, was at the tail end of Sony’s string of failed reimaginings of classic movies. Executives by this point had given up on making this a franchise starter and let the creative team make controversial decisions (like an emphasis on the non-celebrity high school characters) - which was good for the movie but Sony of 2012 would have nixed. Ultimately it was hoped that this movie would just make its money back and Sony’d move on. Instead, the film was a massive hit, and Sony scrambled to get plans in place for a sequel.  

* Venom (2018): Long in development, with the final product looking nothing like what Tom Hardy signed on for. Ultimately middle school boys all agreed that this movie was awesome anyway, and it was a success commercially (although not critically). A sequel is on the way, and all it took was Tom Hardy swallowing his acting scruples and just taking his paycheck. Concerningly, Venom’s “success” may have convinced the Sony executive team that actually, they’re all really smart, and maybe they should have been as involved in the Into the SpiderVerse movie as they were with Venom.

* Girl in the Spider’s Web (2018): The first Girl with the Dragon Tattoo movie was good, and a modest success 10 years ago... the next entry in the franchise was last year, based on a book not written by the series’ original author (even though there were two of the original books still remaining to be made into movies) and a we-hope-you-won’t-notice recasting of the main character. Well, no one noticed this movie coming out, except book fans who felt annoyed.

* Into the Spider-Verse (2018): Before the release of Venom, someone at Sony seemed to have recognized that their executive team has no idea what they’re doing with the Spider Man property, and decided to give the creatives a chance. A hands-off approach was taken for this wacky idea from the creative mind of Phil Lord (the Lego Movie and 21 Jump Street), with decisions that would have once been unthinkable: Peter Parker as only a supporting character (and also as a pancaked character, depending on the universe). The resulting critical success may further go to Sony executives’ heads - “I did this!” “Listen to my great idea for a standalone Jamie-Foxx-as-Electro movie”... “Let’s make Spider-Verse 2 be a rom com!”

venom2,venom sequel,cba52a,The whole Spiderman deal actually makes sense for Sony. They technically don't need Marvel anymore. They can sign Watts for the sequel and just re-sign the screenwriters to make the third one. Marvel is preventing characters like Morbius and Venom from spiderman movies.,Sony is trying to build their own cinematic universe and they have a legitimate hit with Venom which when I saw it twice in theaters it played huge both times. Audiences like Tom Hardy as the character. Naturally Sony wants Venom and Spiderman to co-exist in the same universe because naturally they would want to do a sinister six movie and have them team up.  There's no way Sony is going to be able to do that if Marvel is still controlling every aspect of the IP.,0,68,1562722599.0,2019-07-10 02:36:39,True
venom2,venom sequel,bqdfup,"Hello there, I have a little thought I want to through out there. As a little experiment to all of those who find my post. what is your Fan Cinematic Universe? ( and I don't mean like something someone photoshopped In image)","And what I mean by this is an idea thought up by a YouTuber named Patrick (H) Willems, and in his video about Cinematic Universe. He listed a bunch of movies about the space race, Kennedy Assassination to Nixon Watergate. And also a collection of movie that the comment section was talking about alway, like a trilogy of Scottish History, To an extended franchise of the American Civil War.

But my idea is about movies you (or anyone) thinks that connected. like a certain character from one movie is the main character in another one. An example of this thought up and looked about online is that Gerald Bulter character from Law Abiding Citizen is the Joker from The Dark Knight. Or The movie Life (2017) is a prequel to Venom. Another good example, which is very vague about wanting to be connected to it or not; is that Kurt Russel Soldier is set in Blade Runner. my personal favorites to watch my version of the Dark Universe; which includes, both of the Mummy movies (the original 90's one with the two sequels and the new one) with the five Scorpion King movies, Van Helsing, Werewolf: The Beast Among Us, Red Riding Hood (Because I think its alright), The Prophecy, Dracula Untold, The musical Phantom of the Opera, Disney's Huntchback, I, Frankenstein, and Shape of Water. But Here comes the fun part, I watch them in chronological order by the setting of the movie itself. From The Scorpion King 2 to the Tom Cruise Mummy movie. Even though all my movie choices wouldn't make sense anyway, it's still a fun watch to do. 

Its something like that anyway, It just a little brain teaser for how you like to Marathon your movies.",0,5,1558245343.0,2019-05-19 06:55:43,True
venom2,venom sequel,b16swo,Venom (2018)...actually liked it,"Which surprised me.  After a friend cancelled our drink in favour of sex with his girlfriend (understandable) I decided to stay in and read a book.  Remembering that Venom wasn't supposed to be very good I had it playing in the background. Ended up watching it all the way through and when I saw the end credits scene was excited to see the sequel.  I really can't understand the negativity.  I thought it was a great, dumb, fun, action movie, reminiscent of an 80s buddy-movie (maybe the fact that Brock and Venom become friends appealed to me as my own friend had blown me off in favour of his girl).",18,61,1552602535.0,2019-03-14 22:28:55,True
venom2,venom sequel,as5ky7,Will we ever see another David Fincher movie. Are superhero movies to blame?,"Since 2014 David Fincher has directed 6 Tv episodes. 

&#x200B;

David Fincher is my favorite director and it pains me how unproductive he has been in the past few years. Two of his projects, Utopia (tv series reboot for Amazon) and World War Z (movie sequel for Paramount) have been scrapped due to the fact that he and the network/studio couldn’t agree on the necessary budget. 

&#x200B;

In the years from 2007-2014 Fincher was very productive as he directed a total of *five* movies in the span of *eight* years. 

&#x200B;

In terms of getting his projects made I believe Fincher was born 10-20 years to late. The studios today only seem to be interested in making low budget, high upside horror films or gigantic budget superhero movies. The $60-90 million original idea  movie is dying and that is the sweet spot for creative and ambitious film making. Those movies are now deemed not worthy of marketing due to a low upside. 

&#x200B;

If the movie with the medium budget is a likely Oscars contender, the studios might talk themselves into financing it but given Finchers flare for the perverted and at times grotesque let's just say he's not the Oscars golden boy. He lost to Tom Hooper's  ""King's Speech"" mostly due to Harvey Weinstein''s pull in the industry (that aged well) in 2011 and to Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire in 2009. 

&#x200B;

The limbo that we are in right now while we are stuck in between the rise of the streaming services and the fall of the Studio system is having the affect that highly decorated and creative directors are having a hard time getting their projects greenlit. No wonder when 6 of the top 10 grossing movies of 2018 are fucking superhero movies, and nr 11 is also a superhero movie (Venom) . 

&#x200B;

I can only imagine how many great movies we have missed out on because their budget was gobbled up by the 15th superhero movie released that year. ",0,15,1550545056.0,2019-02-19 02:57:36,True

venom2,carnage,1iviek1,Why did no one tell me Crank (2006) was such a crazy balls to wall movie? Jason Statham's greatest performance. Seriously under-hyped action-comedy.,"Obviously, the title is slightly tongue in cheek, and Crank is a popular, well-known movie. I think it deserves to be seen as an action comedy classic and an archetype of how to make a great fast paced 90 min movie, however. The budget seems fairly mid-range with the various action sequences.

The movie is so frenetic from the very start.  Jason Statham is just goddamn marvelous in it. His greatest performance I have ever seen. 

I'd always thought Statham's best performance was in Snatch. That may be the best movie he's starred in - but Crank has to be the best performance for me. It seems like he's up for anything. It's a satirical self-deprecating Statham performance, like in Spy with Melissa McCarthy. Just really fun.

This movie starts with the foot on the accelerator and doesn't stop, getting more and more crazy as Chev (Statham) fights against the poison in his body - he has to keep his heart rate high to stop it from killing him. 

The action is fun and the movie is very funny. It sort of feels like I am watching a movie version of GTA at times as Chev is just like one of their protagonists and causes utter carnage - I honestly think it must have been inspired by those games (with Sanandreas out a couple years prior). Statham bears a striking resemblance to the look and feel of characters from the later GTA games - so it may have worked both ways.

Amy Smart is so utterly sexy as the girlfriend Eve. A scene stealing role. There's some funny scenes and hijinks where she's getting on with her normal life, lolling about in bed high, trying to fix the microwave clock, while all this crazy pandemonium is kicking off all around her. I love how this film doesn't take itself seriously but is also extremely unrelenting.
 
There's one uncomfortable scene with Chev and Eve which shows the film's age. >!The public sex scene!<. This scene kind of has a >!rapey!< moment that will have you squirming but then it relents and makes up for it with a very funny crazy sequence.

I feel like this film doesn't get the recognition it deserves. I never knew it was so damn good and I'm a huge film fan. I always got the impression it was just a run of the mill noughties action movie.

Edit: >!Just got to the part where Chev and the bad guy fall out the helicopter and through the sky, and continue to argue and fight eachother. Then, after winning, Chev proceeds to make a phonecall while peacefully falling to his death. Again, so so funny.!<",1318,245,1740229862.0,2025-02-22 13:11:02,False
venom2,carnage,1ik7mcl,Spider-Man 3 set Spider-Man 4 up to be the most high budget bloated horror movie ever made,"Spider-Man 3 set Spider-Man 4 up to be a crazy bloated horror crossover, hear me out.

Yeah we know Raimi wanted to a Vulture storyline and didn't want to do the symbiote but the potential for so much more was there and the movie could've been NUTS!

All stemming from the fact a symbiote sample is still in a glass in Dr Connors lab from Spider-Man 3, it's a plot device for all of this:

1. Dr Connors wants to grow his arm back, injects himself with a formula he developed and turns into Lizard.

Peter is in the area and his spider sense tingles seeing danger in Dr Connor's lab, changes into Spider-Man and fights the Lizard not realising its Dr Connors, knocks over the symbite glass in the fight so it escapes. During the fight Lizard knocks Peter into the test tubes Dr Connors was working on the formula that turned him into Lizard and Peter is exposed to a large amount of it.

Lizard wins the fight and escapes.

2. Peter is feeling TERRIBLE after being exposed to the formula, he is bedbound and unwell AND THEN he listens to the police radio and hears a report of the Lizard so he changes into Spider-Man and goes out to fight him.

Spider-Man vs Lizard again BUT THIS TIME HUGE TWIST he turns into MAN-SPIDER and is big and hulking and terrifying, absolutely thrashes Lizard and the defeat reverts him back to Dr Connors. Police shoot at Man-Spider and he retreats. Police detain Dr Connors and take him to a maximum security facility incase he turns into Lizard again.

3. Kraven The Hunter hears about the Man-Spider and Lizard situation so comes to New York to hunt. Ensue a showdown of Kraven vs Man-Spider, he has all the right tools to take him down but doesn't do it on first try.

4. Cut to the maximum security facility Dr Connors is at PLOT TWIST the symbiote from the glass had been clinging onto Dr Connors the whole time but couldn't bond with him because he's not a suitable host. The symbiote senses a suitable host in the prison.

WHO'S ALSO BEING HELD AT THE MAXIMUM SECURITY FACILITY?

KLETUS KASSIDY

Symbiote latches onto Kletus, turns into CARNAGE, does a big prison break where Dr Connors escapes too.

4. Peter listening on his police radio while trying to fight the Man-Spider mutation, hears about some ""carnage"" going on so goes to investigate, turns into Spider-Man again and gets his ass kicked by Carnage, even the big hulking out of control Man-Spider can't defeat Carnage.

Peter teams up with Lizard and Kraven The Hunter to take down Carnage.

5. They take down Carnage but Kraven is still a bad guy so he has to ""finish what he started"" and kills Lizard. In his dying breath Dr Connors tells Peter there is a way to reverse the mutation, where to find the cure in his lab.

Anyway that is the BASIC version of what Spider-Man 4 could've been, would've been a borderline horror movie with Man-Spider and Carnage in it.

Obviously this brief plot synopsis is missing things like Peter's personal life with MJ and Aunt May etc needs alot more depth but that's the basic idea:

MAN-SPIDER, LIZARD, CARNAGE, KRAVEN

What a crazy movie that would've been all thanks to the symbiote sample being left in Dr Connors lab, plot device they could've used but Raimi wouldn't have.

This movie would've been the highest budget movie ever made surely haha.",0,12,1738967263.0,2025-02-07 22:27:43,False

Turns out the kingdom didn't last long.

Whether it was a surprise or not, ***Den of Thieves 2: Pantera*** managed to dethrone ***Mufasa: The Lion King*** for the top spot at the box office. In some very bad news, the wide expansion of ***Better Man*** was a complete disaster, finishing outside the Top 10.

The Top 10 earned a combined $69.6 million this weekend. That's down 16.8% from last year, when ***Mean Girls*** and ***The Beekeeper*** opened. Despite the current LA fires, the LA market still accounted for 8% of the weekend's gross, which is actually above the usual 7.9% in a normal weekend.

Debuting at #1, ***Den of Thieves 2: Pantera*** earned $15 million in 3,008 theaters. That's almost on par with the original ***Den of Thieves*** ($15.2 million). It's also the first Lionsgate film to hit #1 at the box office since ***The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes*** in 2023 (they've had a very bad run last year).

Even though it arrived 7 years later, clearly the interest was there for a ***Den of Thieves*** sequel. Compared to a lot of recent actions flicks with Gerard Butler, it has maintained that popularity thanks to home media and streaming. But these films corner the exact same market: the dad movie market. There's an audience who simply wants to watch an old-school action movie, and ***Den of Thieves*** delivers that (just like ***The Beekeeper*** did one year ago). The LA fires also didn't do much impact in its box office numbers; the LA market generated 10.4% of the film's box office, which is actually bigger than the original's 9.3% LA share.

According to Lionsgate, 63% of the audience was male. As mentioned, this was a dad movie; 79% of the audience was 25 and over, with 52% over 35. They gave it a ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is the same grade as the original. January looks quite weak, although it will have to compete with stuff like ***Wolf Man*** and ***Flight Risk*** in a few weeks. Nevertheless, it has enough gas to hit $40 million domestically.

The reign of ***Mufasa*** lasted just one weekend, as it had to go back to the second spot. The film dropped 39.4%, adding $14.2 million this weekend. The film has earned $188.7 million, which is a colossal 61% behind the 2019 film through the same point.

In third place, ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** dropped 46.8%, adding $11.3 million. With this, it has not only passed the second film's gross, but it also passed the $200 million milestone. It has earned $204.8 million so far, and it should finish with around $240 million domestically.

In fourth place, Focus Features' ***Nosferatu*** dropped 47.3%, adding $6.8 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to a fantastic $81.8 million, and it's still on pace to finish with over $100 million, assuming it's not killed by ***Wolf Man*** this weekend.

***Moana 2*** fell back to Earth after its holiday boost. It dropped 47.5%, earning $6.5 million this weekend. The film has amassed $434.8 million domestically.

Searchlight's ***A Complete Unknown*** eased 37.4%, adding $5.1 million this weekend. With this, the film has crossed $50 million domestically, although the dream of $100 million died.

***Wicked*** had a slightly rough drop. This time, it fell 48.7%, grossing $5.1 million this weekend. Nevertheless, it's not like Universal ain't hurtin'; the film has made $70 million in PVOD in its first week. The film has earned a fantastic $458 million so far.

In eighth place, A24's ***Babygirl*** is still holding very well despite the end of the holidays. The film eased just 30.6% (the best drop in the top 10), adding $3 million this weekend. The film has earned a damn good $21.7 million so far.

In ninth place, the Indian film ***Game Changer*** earned $2 million from just 805 theaters.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Roadside Attractions' ***The Last Showgirl***, which finally had its wide release after having a limited weekend run at a single theater last month. It debuted with a solid $1.5 million in 870 theaters. While it's set to expand it in to a few more theaters, don't expect it to hit $10 million.

A24 expanded ***The Brutalist*** to 68 theaters, coming off its big wins at the Golden Globes last week. The film grossed a pretty great $1.3 million, which is a very strong $20,408 per-theater average. So far, the film has earned $2.7 million. It will see another expansion this weekend, before finally hitting wide release the following weekend.

***Gladiator II*** fell 53.4%, adding $1.2 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $170.9 million.

We have to go all the way to the #13 spot to find the weekend's other expansion, Paramount's ***Better Man***, the Robbie Williams biopic. We knew it was not gonna break out, given that its limited release numbers were very poor. Yet the film managed to surprise us by going even lower.

***Better Man*** debuted in 1,291 theaters, and the film earned a terrible $1 million. Yep, you read that correctly. That's an anemic $824 per-theater average. Assuming that each theater played this five times a day at a regular $11.90 ticket price, that means that there were just 4 people in each screening. Woah. And to make things worse, the film cost $110 million. Now, Paramount is not deeply invested in here; they only picked the distribution rights to the film for $25 million. They won't lose a lot of money, but this will be another money loss for them.

The American market was never going crazy for a Robbie Williams biopic for a simple reason: they have no idea who Robbie Williams is. That's quite surprising, given that he's the one of the best-selling singers in history (75 million records sold puts him in the same vein as The Weeknd, Green Day, Oasis, Nirvana and Imagine Dragons). But despite his popularity across Europe, Oceania and Latin America, Williams never broke out in America. Only two of his songs made it in the Billboard Top 100 (""Angels"" and ""Millennium"") and they both peaked at #53 and #72. So despite selling out a lot of concerts and records, he's still a complete unknown in America.

There's also the decision that was supposed to be its selling point, but still drew a polarizing reaction. To separate itself from other biopics, the film decided to depict Williams as a CGI chimpanzee. Bonus points for originality, but that also confused the general audience. So the audience are left with two questions ""who is Robbie Williams?"" and ""why is he a chimpanzee?"" Instead of trying to find more or listen to a few songs from Williams, they simply chose to not watch it all. After all, a music biopic is aimed at big fans of a singer, so why would they pay for an artist they don't care about? Even with great reviews (88% on RT and 77 on Metacritic), that's not enough to make them change their mind.

According to Paramount, 56% of the audience was male, and 52% was 25 and over. Despite some great word of mouth (83% on PostTrak, 63% definite recommend), this is not a film that will leg out. It's not gonna hit $5 million domestically, and it's likely it could miss $3 million as well. We want to say it will be saved overseas, but the film has been disappointing in the UK and Australia so far. This is a flop.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Mufasa: The Lion King*** topped the box office with $27.8 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $542 million. The film's best markets are France ($33.7M), UK ($29.9M), Mexico ($24.6M), Germany ($24M) and Italy ($21.8M).

***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** added $20.3 million, as it's nearing $400 million worldwide. Most notably, it opened in China, where it flopped with only a little over $1 million. The film's best markets are UK ($25.9M), Mexico ($18.8M), France ($15.8M), Australia ($13.2M) and Brazil ($9.2M).

***Nosferatu*** added $13.7 million, taking its worldwide total to a fantastic $135.4 million. It's Robert Egger's highest grossing film by a wide margin, passing ***The Northman*** a long time ago. The best markets are the UK ($11.1M), Mexico ($6.03M), Italy ($4.3M), Germany ($3.5M) and Australia ($3.4M).

***Moana*** added $11.1 million, helping it reach $990 million worldwide. The film's best markets are France ($60.6M), UK ($49.7M), Germany ($41.7M), Mexico ($30.2M) and Australia ($29.5M). It's hitting the billion milestone sometime this week.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Venom: The Last Dance* | Oct/25 | Sony | $51,012,404 | $139,755,882 | $474,775,261 | $120M
*Y2K* | Dec/6 | A24 | $2,113,923 | $3,763,863 | $3,763,863 | $15M

- Sony's ***Venom: The Last Dance*** has closed with $474 million worldwide. Despite its poor reception and word of mouth (""B–"" on CinemaScore), the film benefitted from a lack of competition, as studios chose to avoid releasing anything close to the election. A success? Definitely. But the film still ended up making less money than ***Let There Be Carnage***, which was released in worse conditions and had no China grosses. Who knows what's the future for this character.

- A24's ***Y2K*** has closed with a very poor $3.7 million in North America, which is a very bad 1.78x multiplier. Despite Kyle Mooney's interest in filmmaking, the film struggled to balance its horror and comedy elements, but at the end of the day, the audience simply wasn't interested. Let's hope his next film is much better, if he ever gets the chance.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We find two newcomers this weekend.

The first, and perhaps the weekend's winner, is Universal/Blumhouse's ***Wolf Man***. The film is the latest addition in Universal's reboot of their Classic Monsters line-up, after the success of ***The Invisible Man*** (also written and directed by Leigh Whannell). Horror is a very reliable genre, so perhaps we might be looking at another winner here.

The other wide release is Sony's ***One of Them Days***, which stars Keke Palmer and SZA as two friends who seek to avoid eviction. In the current landscape, there's been very few comedies not tied to IPS, so this can be a good test to see the interest in R-rated comedies.

#**ANNOUNCEMENT**

As this weekend falls on the MLK weekend, the actuals will probably be delayed by a day. So the post will go up on Tuesday.

venom2,carnage,1hssbxd,Looking Back On 2024 (A Cinematic Year in Review),"As a preface, I will only list here what I watched during the past year, which includes the delayees (is that even a word) from 2023, movies moved to 2024 due to the idiotic distribution structure of my country. These include The Iron Claw, The Holdovers, Poor Things, May December, The Zone of Interest, The Boy and the Heron, Priscilla and the Anatomy of a Fall. Some others I didn’t get around to watch or haven’t heard of before 2024, like Sisu, Kiss The Girls or Mr. Holmes. With that out of the way, let’s get down to it!

34. Rebel Moon: A Child of Fire. No surprise here, but I still think it’s a half-decent movie. I mean, of course, most of the plot is claptrap (despite a couple good in-isolation scenes), the lore is established way too haphazardly for its own good and the cinematography doesn’t provide as much gravitas or atmosphere to the scenes as it thinks it is, but Snyder still manages to squeeze out some nice performances (in particular from Michiel Huisman and the delightfully malicious Ed Skrein as Admiral Atticus Noble). And the score by Junkie XL unironically SLAPS. It’s weighty, ethereal and immersive as fuck, especially everytime chorals and angry artificial howling - Noble’s theme - can be heard on the screen. It is ultimately due to the music that the movie is not a failure.

33. Godzilla X Kong: A New Empire. This one’s merit, on the other hand, lies exclusively in the visual spectacle. Here Holkenborg could not cook up something noteworthy, but the action carried hard. I mean, mostly because the Skar King and Shimo’s battle against G and K wore off pretty quickly. The human characters were uncompelling, the story presented no interesting themes, and the visuals I found pretty below average. It was just mediocre.

32. Rebel Moon: The Scargiver. A slight bump as far as overall cinematic quality is concerned. The cinematography offers something more visually enthralling, and this time Snyder’s time wasting pays off in a way. Holkenborg keeps the score quality intact, as is the case with Skrein’s performance. But the movie is still a haphazardly conceived mess of poorly constructed, bizarrely acting individuals I’ve little to no connection to. So, a miss.

31. Ferrari. I don’t have a whole lot to say about it, other than the faux-Italian accents were a definite miss, and everything aside from the racing scenes and Penelope Cruz’s performance was just uninteresting. But Cruz and the races carried hard, plain and simple. Still, a mediocre movie that fails to examine its protagonist.

30. Mr. Holmes. It was an overall interesting take on an older Holmes, with Ian McKellen turning in a memorable performance as both versions of the character. To me the film did a good job juggling three separate plotlines, all of which had some merit. All in all, a graceful portrayal of an aged hero that lost most things and people he cared about. For some it’ll certainly be more graceful than the fates of Indiana Jones, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.

29. The Boy and the Heron. Compared to how praised it was… I was disappointed. Maybe it was just me getting to know Miyazaki for the first time for real. But interestingly enough, I found very little interesting content in the movie other than the animation itself and the Grey Heron. I sure felt for Mahito, but I didn’t get to know him a whole lot in a substantial way. Nor any other character, really. They were like silhouettes, just passing through the screen, mere figures pushing Mahito to the next plot point. And his grand-grand-grand uncle? A complete afterthought. I don’t even know why he created that fantastical world, and a minute of WW2 carnage coupled with a few throwaway lines about the world’s “wickedness” a theme make not, sadly. But it’s still a good movie.

28. The Beekeeper. I had a good time, despite a plot light on thematics and character, but loaded with an absurd amount of bee metaphors. Adam, Jason Statham’s character, was reasonably grounded with both ruthlessness for capitalist scammers and care for ordinary citizens. Add some nice visuals, twists and supporting performances and you got a good, if overall run-of-the-mill action flick.

27. Scent of a Woman. Yeah, I like it. Most of it boils down to a fucking tour de force performance by Al Pacino and character work related to his character, but he just makes it work, especially with the “I’ll show you OUT OF ORDER!” scene. I won’t elaborate any further.

26. Insurrectionist 1863. For the first time we venture into Poland to see a historical movie telling the story of Father Stanisław Brzóska’s involvement in the January Uprising of 1863. The priest himself aside, the characters weren’t too compelling, but Brzóska’s journey throughout the movie, especially his role as a priest evolving in the conflict, makes it all worth it. This is a piece of cinema hard carried by the protagonist.

25. Screw Mickiewicz. Once more a Polish film which will (most likely) only hit for you if you’re from the country like myself. But it was a genuinely hilarious and lively flick, with a lot of actual understanding of the teenage Poles’ mentality and some fairly emotional moments. Also, a really nice soundtrack assembled from the works of modern Polish rap and pop artists.

24. The Iron Claw. Another overrated - if nearly actually great - darling of 2023. Like with Miyazaki’s piece, I felt little emotional connection to the Von Erich brothers, the most belonging to David - who died first. The amount of bad shit happening in succession was also too much; it felt like, dare I say, misery porn at times. No interesting cinematography (save for the black ‘n’ white opening) or music either. But the movie did present a compelling story looking at the plot elements themselves, and Fritz Von Erich was a very well-realized character.

23. May December. The first proper great movie of the bunch. Maybe some more time should have been spent on dissecting the relationship between Melton’s Joe and Moore’s Gracie, but since the protagonist is a sensationalist, self-important bitch that doesn’t care about the people she’ll be portraying, that’s what we get. Speaking of which, Natalie Portman made the movie for me, it was like a female Kirk Lazarus performance, absolutely stunning. Technical side of things wise it didn’t wow me, but its examination of the subject matter is absolutely commendable.

22. Sisu. Holy crap, what a great action flick. A bunch of decently despicable Nazis against an endlessly adaptable Finnish vet/hermit. Some nice team work between him and the enslaved women in the end, enthralling action and the pure grit make for a great offering. Again, see it in case you have not!

21. Alien: Romulus. I never hated Covenant (I just thought the ending with le bad guy David winning was stupid, which was understandable given the fact I was 14 back then and didn’t truly recognize the merit of bleaker closures in cinema), so I didn’t expect Romulus to be a “return to form”, but its upholding, which it was. Cailee Spaeny once again smashed the hell out of her role, nailing her more relaxed and tense scenes a like. She is also able to just… appear and act genuinely likeable, she makes for a rootable protagonist, y’know? Another standout is David Jonsson, playing an android like he was Paul Bettany or goddamn Michael Fassbender himself. Ian Holm’s undead appearance is irksome, sure, but they managed to disguise it well enough for me not to detect it until after I delved into the discourse. The horror of the aliens? On point. Atmosphere? Impeccable. Visuals? Breathtaking.

20. Rebel Ridge. This one is a milder offering spectacle and politics wise compared to the ones that come after it in the list, but it’s a worthy watch. The opener alone is a powerful one, and while perhaps not entirely accurate to how these things would go down, it gave me a good idea of the possible ways American cops abuse their authority, especially in regards to black people. And it’s consistently great throughout, especially with its execution of the non-killing protagonist.

19. Kiss The Girls. It’s an older one, but it checks out. I especially appreciate the sheer terror of the Casanova, both pre and post-reveal. Morgan Freeman, Cary Elwes and Ashley Judd all crushed their roles. But this won’t do the movie any justice… If you haven’t seen it for yourself, do it.

18. Furiosa. As far as prequels go, this one’s neat. Important info regarding the Mad Max world is there, coupled with brilliant performances by Anya Taylor-Joy (how the hell did she manage to emulate Charlize this well?! HOW?!) and Chris Hemsworth, who, channeling his inner Thor, puts a MadMaxesque spin on it, adding a layer of post-apocalyptic internal hollowness and insatiable, self-fueling cruelty and hatred, bred by some terrible trauma, not unlike Furiosa’s (or Thor’s, for that matter). I suppose that’s the main merit of the movie, the ways in which they mirror each other. Which makes their final scene together a fucking standout. Also, pay attention to the History Man: George Shevtsov is fantastic in the role, and occasionally he drops Thanos-level banger lines, adding both philosophical ideas and vulnerability to the story.

17. Joker: Folie à Deux. Likely the most controversial take, but I love this movie. It takes the well-known story from 2019, puts it in a new setting and makes the most of it. I was especially stoked once I realized the musical inserts were fantasies, extensions of Arthur and Harley’s desires, fears and wishes. The score provided a nice layer of gloominess to the whole, the cinematography was jaw-dropping, and I can’t help but find the conclusion… fitting. Like many others have said before me: it wasn’t about the Clown Prince of Crime. It was about a marginalized man who inadvertently became a symbol and an outlet for disillusioned citizens to embody their own fear and anger, only to be hated, rejected and forgotten once he declared he shared their fear and anger no longer. A beautiful deconstruction.

16. Scarborn. Another Polish film, but this time it’s a historical action flick. Centered around the Kościuszko Insurrection of 1794 it provides a pretty immersive piece of historical fiction centered around how said Insurrection came to be. Wait through the lengthy build up and the final act will wow you with Tarantino-esque tension and spectacle. Some fantastic cinematography, too!

15. Anora. This hurts me the most, because I believe it’s an impressive offering, but lacks “the sauce”. As great as Mikey Madison was as Anora, as believable as the world and characters around her were, I found insufficient amounts of context to care about her as much as Baker wanted me to. How fucking sad it is that I found TOROS, the main henchman character more interesting and entertaining to watch than her? Didn’t help that Baker couldn’t find the right tone for several scenes, especially the supposedly serious ones overloaded with comedic inserts… But his direction, especially the camera movement was without a doubt a true show of skill, and I cannot find any fault in the cinematography and non-lead performances either.

14. Wrooklyn Zoo. Yet another Polish movie in the mix, and most likely the most special one. It’s about Poland’s modern problems, the virtues and sins of the old and the youth and the absolutely amazing yet painful feeling that is love. While I don’t think our protagonists were amazing characters and the final act relies on a bit of resurrectionist Hollywood bullshit, the movie drips with style, heart and distinct energy that’s hard to put into words. Also, the pacing was fantastic. Made it seem like a movie of twice its length yet endlessly captivating.

13. Civil War. My introduction to Alex Garland, and what an introduction that was! My most favorite thing about it is just how hard it drills into the conflict between journalistic integrity and the pervasive sensationalist nature of the job, especially in America. Every single main character felt like a real person with their own ideas and priorities, everyone embodied their characters to a fault, and I could only watch with wonder and horror as their lives and jobs turned to shit due to the eponymous conflict. The final third is as captivating as it is devastating and can really make you think about the possibility of objective, well-intentioned documentation of tragedies.

12. The Holdovers. Maybe the most wholesome and hilarious thing I saw in 2024. Along the incredible, sharp performances by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa and Da’Vine Joy Randolph wraps Alexander Payne’s whimsical yet touching screenplay. It’s a movie that understands the bitter, but at the same time shows them their current state of being doesn’t have to be what defines their life or gives it purpose.

11. Carry-On. I expected it to be a somewhat interesting execution of a promising premise. But man oh MAN, I was not prepared to witness the absolute CINEMA of it all, not at all! Everyone from Edgerton to Bateman is on their A game, the protagonist and the antagonists constantly outsmarting each other makes for an endlessly tense and riveting dynamic, and even the themes themselves present some interesting commentary about military subcontractors, arms deals and the boogeyman of Russian threat to America.

10. Poor Things. The VERY dodgy implications of what is being done to Bella and the unnecessary POV shift from the source material aside, this was a sublime introduction to Lanthimos. Whatever the scene called for, the man and his crew were more than up for the task. Tension, wonder, elation, terror, despair, hopelessness, cynicism, fulfillment, whimsy… all conveyed with a weirdness I suppose is uniquely his. Also, BRAVO to Jerskin Fendrix for that score. Bizarre yet utterly enthralling in how intrusive and odd it is. And to Emma Stone, who can like no other portray a determined, stoically wisecracking British woman.

9. The A(A)-Team. The final Polish offering. I did not expect to love it as much as I did. But when you get a bunch of terribly scarred yet well-meaning people trying to atone for what they did as alcoholics, a plot that combines the whackier sides of Poland and a very emotional main goal, with vibes and directorial style that keeps you glued to the screen no matter what, you get pretty good fucking cinema. My personal standouts are the little monochrome pencil-driven flashback animations that, combined with the protagonists’ voiceover, explain the mistakes they made and the pain they caused.

8. Priscilla. Cailee Spaeny should’ve been nominated for this, no doubt. She is as believable as her character at 14 as she is at 25. Her ability to transition between ages was just phenomenal. Make up team, Jacob Elordi and Sofia Coppola also deserve genuine praise. But my biggest praise for the film lies in the fact that it managed to make a great story without creating a narrative centered around a specific endeavor or event. It’s just a collection of connected events, yet each of them reveals something interesting about the characters or the world they inhabit.

7. Anatomy of a Fall. Probably the most down-to-earth film in the group. It leaves you with a lack of closure, a feeling of strong ambiguity and uncertainty. Which I suppose was the directorial intent. Great performances from everyone (though the one I’d nominate Sandra Hüller for was in Glazer’s, not Triet’s movie), a compelling mystery, and the courtroom scenes… Oh, they were a fucking blast. It was like watching a dead-serious, prosaic, more sincere version of Ace Attorney. Just as much entertainment and dynamism in the scenes, but without AA’s crazy energy. Best hallmarks of the movie’s quality are the fact I could only nitpick the slightly underwhelming cinematography and the grating 50 Cent track.

6. Speak No Evil. You’re probably surprised to see it up here, but I’mma own it. Not only does Speak No Evil use its vague premise to create a ticking bomb of a plot that once goes off, it fucking TEARS the screen to shreds. After that, it also becomes a fucking MASTERCLASS in tension, my whole body was there ready to give out any minute once our protagonists realized the deep shit they were in. Special accolades to James McAvoy, Mackenzie Davis and Scoot McNairy as far as performances go. There are also some well-conveyed themes about generational trauma poisoning people’s souls, the dangers of the inability to say “no” and the depths some will go to justify their actions. Fantastic filmmaking.

5. The Apprentice. I have to applaud Ali Abbasi for managing to keep the story infused with the typical Trumpian undertones of vanity, hedonism and rapaciousness and not losing the emotion in it. The movie forges the spear of depressive truths about Trump’s world and stabs you with it repeatedly. But eventually, the stab just hurts you somewhere lower, existentially. You don’t even feel for Donald anymore, if you ever did in the first place. All that’s left is Roy and Ivana, and they’re both royally screwed. As is America, if the final shot and real life are anything to go by. But hey, at least we got a three-composer-collaboration of a score that is both cohesive and fucking excellent in quality. How about that? (Nominate Dirkov, Holmes and Irvine for the Oscar, you COWARDS!)

4. Conclave. The one movie where my firm expectations regarding its quality were thoroughly fulfilled. When you look at it as a whole, you may come to a conclusion it’s like Oppenheimer, but in a church setting. I mean, I sure did get the impression, considering the sharp, visually clean and orderly directing/editing style, the rhythmically oppressive yet graceful score and the raw yet elegant acting of the performers involved. Fiennes earned his Best Actor nom, no doubt, but I’m secretly hoping for a Best Supporting nom for Carlos Diehz as Vincent Benítez. He sold the man’s honesty, kindness and timidness with such conviction I only doubted it due to a fakeout Berger planted last minute. As far as their characters’ innocence goes, this year only Cailee Spaeny matched Diehz. The movie plays like a purebred conspiracy thriller, questioning everyone’s motives, infusing paranoia and uncertainty into every scene. You have ZERO fucking confusion about the extent to which the Holy See lost its way, because certain frames just scream “This can’t be made right, can IT?!” But the movie’s true genius lies in its twist, because it reframes both the movie’s themes and characters in ways never explicitly stated, yet hard-hitting once inferred. This would’ve been a masterpiece had the secondary antagonist been more fleshed out.

3. Dune Part 2. Denis Villeneuve and Greg Fraser ain’t skipped a single goddamn beat on the production. Hans Zimmer did, but even with more repetition his musical material is top-notch. The movie sure takes a while to get going, but I have nothing but applause for it for how effectively it establishes its antagonist (really crappy how they did very little with him in the end, though), and how the Harkonnenian clusterfuck on Arrakis beautifully falls apart with time. When Paul ascends to Prophet level and goes sicko mode on the establishment, the movie kicks into its highest gear on all levels. We understand everyone’s position in the conflict and what they’re willing to do to achieve their goals. Which makes it so frustrating Emperor Shaddam and Feyd-Rautha do not get nearly enough time to have their political and philosophical perspectives be expressed. But still, the movie is lethally efficient when it comes to… Chani and her disillusionment arc. Not only is she an excellent mirror to the bloodthirsty Gurney and the increasingly fanatical Stilgar, Zendaya turns in some incredibly believable acting that had me rooting for her with no questions. I can’t wait for Messiah, and Shai-Hulud bless Villeneuve’s team!

2. The Zone of Interest. That movie hits on a deeper level. I did not actually comprehend what I saw until I was back home from the theater, and that’s when I started crying. The movie is indeed viciously effective in how much it can tear your heart out without you seeing or realizing it in the first place. Insanely beautiful cinematography, and the score… 3 tracks in the whole movie, yet they’re all fucking Oscar-worthy. Great acting. And the theme of invisibility… it’s clear enough you know what’s the context Glazer applies it to, but also subtle enough everyone will have ideas about what it means to say and which other contexts it can be applied to in real life. Probably the best candidate for 2023’s BP barring Oppenheimer.

1. The Substance. If The Zone of Interest is bold, then Coralie Fargeat’s project is BOLD. Not really in its theme, but in how it’s executed. It’s an attack on the senses, in both a good and bad way. The screen sucks you in and shits you out time and time again. You’re in an abusive relationship with it, just like Liz Sparkle is with The Substance/Sue. Huge props for the trailer, because it fooled me so hard into thinking we’d be getting an individual v individuals/society conflict, while we got an individual v self conflict. I was watching with all my interest as Liz and Sue tried to undermine each other yet being constantly forced to rely on one another, as the situation got worse and worse. It’s not that a person is trying to destroy themself, it’s how extreme the degradation is. The movie knows no fucking restraint sometimes, and in those times the terror can be mixed with perverse glee and karmic satisfaction, gives those times coincide with character punishment, but when it manages to show restraint, the horror stings more profoundly. In 2024 few things in cinema managed to scare the crap out of me, and one of them was Sue smiling hysterically to a mirror as several of her teeth were falling out. The Substance thrives in the hateful and the loving, the gross and the tantalizing, the sinister and the kind. At its heart it’s a story of a woman who could not forgive herself for something she had no control over. You really see it in 3 scenes only, but those 3 scenes are what’s enough to make the movie sincere. Moore and Qualley are insanely convincing. God! Just give it the BP already!

All in all, a great year. I won’t say it’s superior to 2023 or anything, but I think I’d rate The Substance on the same level as Babylon (a delayee from 2022 that topped the 2023 chart), which I suppose is saying something. But now I know one thing for sure. Cinema has become something I’ll probably love forever.",3,0,1735926614.0,2025-01-03 17:50:14,False
venom2,carnage,1ho9cro,Favorite end credits song/needle drop?,"Mine will always be ""Blue Moon"" by The Marcels in An American Werewolf in London. I don't know how to explain it, but after having seen so much carnage and tragedy, that light-hearted needle drop feels like a welcome breath of fresh air. I think it's an absolutely genius way to end the film. 


Having Green Room go out to ""Sinister Purpose"" by Creedence is also absolutely brilliant...


Or what about ""Hit the Road Jack"" in The House that Jack Built, haha.

venom2,carnage,1hetrq0,"I have a soft spot for ""Die Hard 2"" even though I admit it's basically the least of the original three ""Die Hard"" entries.","There's no way, of course, that ""2"" could hope to escape the shadow of the legendary original, but it's also overshadowed by ""Vengeance"" given that features such things as Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson's interplay and Jeremy Irons's terrific villain turn. It plays often like a rehash of the original (even making fun of it, like when Willis asks how it can happen to him twice). The villains are fine, but not anywhere near as memorable as Alan Rickman or Irons. And so on.

But I still really like it as a fun action flick and a worthy successor even if it doesn't quite compare to its predecessor and successor. The setting is great as an airport at Christmas is a fabulous setting for maximum carnage and chaos. Willis still has John McClane in this one as a beleaguered everyman thrown into a situation he didn't expect or want (guy just wants to pick up his wife and get back for Christmas with the in-laws) and we see him at arguably his most vulnerable at certain points. And it keeps the tradition of the first one by having even minor characters be memorable (like the cute Avis clerk who both aids and flirts with John or Holly's Taser-wielding seatmate). I frankly like watching both this and the original at Christmas as a pair for some good holiday-themed action.

I'd also add another aspect that stands out; this is the darkest and most brutal entry in the franchise. Not only does it have arguably the most graphic deaths of the series (see John stabbing the mook Baker through the eye with an icicle or Major Grant getting kicked into the plane turbine), but the villains are genuine terrorists in this one, not just using it for cover. Bill Sadler plays Lt. Col. Stuart as a cold-blooded sociopath with none of Hans or Simon's charisma or likable traits, which makes him arguably the scariest ""Die Hard"" villain (easily the most hatable; Sadler apparently considers it a compliment when people tell him how much they hate the character, because that's what he intended). And worst of all, THEY CRASH A PLANE. A plane with over 200 people on it, including children. And no one makes it out alive. You have to respect an action film with the guts to do that to show just how serious the threat is.",395,288,1734273214.0,2024-12-15 14:33:34,False
venom2,carnage,1gosvwj,I've watched almost 200 unseen movies as part of a weekly challenge for myself. What should be my 200th movie? ,"Since April 2021, I've engaged in a personal challenge where once a week I watch one film I haven't watched before; an unseen movie. It can be a newly released film or it can be decades old; it just has to be one I haven't watched yet. I've watched plenty of films before doing this and honestly my number of total films I've watched is probably closer to 500 at least.

But anyway, sometime in December I will be watching my 200th film as part of my weekly challenge. My problem is that I want it to be a really good film to celebrate doing this for almost 200 weeks (It's probably more like 195 weeks but whatever). My 100th film was Good Will Hunting, which was probably one of the best films I watched in 2023, so I'm looking for something along the lines of that in terms of a classic movie.

So with all that in mind, what you recommend be my 200th film?

I have a list of all the films I've watched as part of my challenge, which is fairly diversified. I said my total film count is higher but just assume these are the only ones I've watched. Or if you want, make an educated guess at what films I've already seen based on the list.

venom2,carnage,1gdpi5u,I can’t believe how well done the Hunger Games Saga was,"Everyone that wants to make a book into a movie needs to study this series. They took the entire book and then gave the perspective of people that it didn’t even cover since it was limited to Katniss’ POV.

Also, the cast is perfect. Jennifer Lawrence embodies the type of stress and anxiety and trauma that someone in Katniss’ shoes would be going through. Just incredible.

I’m amazed at how easy they made it look sticking to the source material. It’s like the producers knew that the book was all everyone needed, but to see it instead of reading it.

I watched these only once through with each title except for seeing the first one a couple times when it was still new, but I was too young to realize that this series isn’t just about dystopia, but mostly about propaganda. It feels uncanny seeing the political side of the war alongside the carnage of it on an even scale. It reminds me of what everyone is going through right now all around the world, and how we take our sides based off the information we find acceptable. This saga only gets better and more relatable with age.

And I enjoy it every single goddamn time.

Maybe it's because of how ridiculous and incoherent it is, finding joy in the chaos.

Maybe it's the gratuitous violence and nudity, just pure unadulterated madness.

Maybe it's Mads freaking Mikkelsen carrying the film damn near singlehandedly on his back, shooting assassins in the snow buck naked.

There's that surprisingly emotional final scene with him and Camille, Matt Lucas devouring the scenery, Vivienne and her never-ending supply of wigs, laser gloves that let you fire machine guns, a hallway shootout after 4 days of torture, Duncan showing off a kukri to a bunch of school kids, the possible John Wick joke about Rusty the dog, the list goes on.

This film is a piping hot mess of over saturated carnage and all the charm of a monster truck with flaming cinder blocks for tyres, yet it's the best example I can personally give of a 'guilty pleasure' film.

I'm probably alone in that thinking but hey, in case anyone fancies a dumb loud action film with lots of shooty shooty, seriously intense colours, and Mads Mikkelsen being cool (as ever), boy do I have a film for you!",71,34,1724559030.0,2024-08-25 05:10:30,False
venom2,carnage,1e9fiq3,"When it comes to shark cinema, Jaws is the best and Deep Blue Sea is the most. I analyzed theatrically released shark films, pulled shark data, & DBS features the most shark carnage. The sharks have almost 27 minutes of screen time & the longest gap of time without sharks is 6 minutes & 37 seconds","When it comes to ranking shark films the clear #1 is *Jaws*. It’s not even close because the movie is an all-timer that features some of the most iconic movie moments of all time and is one of the few horror films to be nominated for Best Picture. Any “Best Shark Movie” list only gets interesting when it comes to picking the second best shark movie as *Deep Blue Sea, The Shallows, Under Paris*, *Jaws 2, The Reef, Open Water,* and *The Meg* all have sound arguments to be in the #2 spot. 

Since *Jaws* makes it almost impossible to make an interesting “Best Shark Movie” list. I decided to analyze 15 theatrically released shark films (and *Under Paris* because it’s awesome) to see which shark movie features the most shark carnage and screen time. Basically, I wanted to know which shark movie is the MOST shark movie. 

**Quick Note** - If you’ve followed my data posts since 2017 you’ll know that I love *Deep Blue Sea* and have posted many times on Reddit about it (Reddit links [~here~](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6q3vx0/today_is_deep_blue_seas_18th_anniversary_here_are/), [~here~](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/kcz36z/in_honor_of_the_8_minutes_that_deep_blue_sea/), [~here~](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/cf7vdp/in_honor_of_the_upcoming_20th_anniversary_of_deep/), and [~here~](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6adtem/after_a_fair_amount_of_research_calculations_and/)). I also started *Deep Blue Sea - The Podcast* in 2020 and I think you should listen to it wherever you listen to podcasts. That being said, I had no idea which movie would be the “Most Shark Movie” and would’ve been totally fine if DBS lost to *Jaws 2, The Shallows* or *The Meg* because I love them all. 

**Here are the five things I examined:**

**Amount of shark screen time** - The shark has to be alive (the dead Megalodon in *The Meg* doesn’t count) and I counted the time of the entire scene in which the shark is featured. There are moments when the camera cuts to a reaction shot of a human and then back to the shark. I counted it all. 

**How long until we see the entire shark.** In *Deep Blue Sea*, the [~first full sighting of a shark~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lPGiKG9VI8&list=PLZbXA4lyCtqpfHQf7zgcXwU7Bp6_l5yBQ&index=1&pp=iAQB) occurs at 3 minutes and 28 seconds. It’s quick! Renny doesn’t mess around.

**First Attack -** [~The first attack in~ *~Jaws~* ~happens at the 4:05 mark~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrEvK-tv5OI&list=PLZbXA4lyCtqrbRxPpGTtJmuKFumWfw7l3&index=1&pp=iAQB)

**Longest time gaps between shark sightings** - In *Jaws 2*, there’s a 45-minute gap between the first full shark sighting and its next appearance. 

**How many 10-minute gaps are there between shark sightings?** 

**\*Quick Note** - I considered a “Most Kills” category but I didn’t want to penalize movies like *Open Water* and *The Reef* for having relatively low body counts because they aren’t that kind of shark movie. 

I created a ranking system to see which theatrically released shark movie is the MOST shark movie. The movie with the lowest amount of points wins because it typically ranked #1-3 in every category. 

I chose to leave movies like *Ghost Shark, Sharknado, Tintorera, Black Demon*, and *Shark Bait* (which I've all watched) because it opens a vast world of shark movies that differ in quality. 

[This list isn't about quality, it's about which shark movie features the most shark carnage. ](https://preview.redd.it/8l0ceecvs2ed1.png?width=1702&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f3618bc930d3c8d83916c8111f382df17828a42)

**Fun quotes**

* “My whole approach to this movie was no more hiding sharks. This time you’re going to really see them.” Renny Harlin - [~DBS extras~](https://youtu.be/nPcqMFK14MM) (fun BTS doc about how they made the sharks). 
* In the wet labs, there’s an incredible long scene where the shark is basically there in broad daylight for many mand pages of dialogue - Walt Conti ([~same DBS shark BTS doc~](https://youtu.be/nPcqMFK14MM))
* “Yes! It does look like a Mako Shark! Congratulations! And even got the teeth right. Good job people!” - Marine Biologist [~Melissa Cristina Márquez during a Marine Biologist Breaks Down Shark Scenes From Movie GQ video~](https://youtu.be/GhgmGZWGFKk?si=N68Q3YMY5bPTtlI2) 

The overall winner is *Deep Blue Sea* because the sharks have almost 27 minutes of screen time and play a major role throughout. Movies like *Open Water* (divers are left behind while scuba diving and have to deal with sharks), *The Reef* (A boat sinks and characters have to deal with sharks) and *47 Meters Down* (a shark cage sinks and the characters have to deal with sharks) introduce sharks as hurdles to deal with. *In Deep Blue Sea,* the sharks are front and center as they drive the plot and use a gurney (with Stellan Skarsgård attached to it) to flood a large chunk of the Aquatica facility.

Director Renny Harlin has always been open about how it pays homage to the *Jaws* (license plate, similar shark kills) and *Jurassic Park* (genetic modification, Samuel L. Jackson is eaten, separated arms, clever animals, big rainstorms, kitchen fights) franchises, and he made sure to follow their footsteps by creating a wonderful summer blockbuster that pulled in $165 million during the loaded 1999 summer. It’s the type of film that makes it impossible to say something like “It needed more shark action” or “The trailers were misleading. I thought there would be more sharks.” For better or worse, Harlin loaded the film with sharks and I love him for it. I’m happy that this data backs up what Brian Raftery wrote about for Wired in 2017 ([~Forget Jaws. The Real Shark Movie to Beat Is Deep Blue Sea~](https://www.wired.com/2016/06/deep-blue-sea-celebration/))

Here’s a quick timeline of DBS to prove how much shark action there is (Timestamps were pulled from my digital copy)

* 00:02:38 - Gen-1 shark attacks a boat
* 00:03:28 - We see the entire Gen-1 shark
* 00:07:15 - Tiger Shark is lowered into a holding area
* 00:09:10 - Carter Blake takes a license plate out of its mouth
* 00:11:10 - silhouette of the giant Gen-2 shark
* 00:13:18 - Sharks are seen swimming around
* 00:18:00 - The tiger shark is eaten
* 00:19:28 - During the surprise party and the following conversations the sharks are swimming around in their cages
* 00:25:88 - 00:34:28 - Lots of shark action
* 40:45 - Gen-2 shark uses Jim’s gurney to destroy wet lab
* 47:00 - Gen-1 shark enters the Aquatica
* 51:30 - Gen-1 shark chases Preacher and a shark fight ensues
* 57:00 - Preacher blows up a Gen 1 shark
* 01:00:10 - Samuel L. Jackson is eaten by the gen 2 shark
* 01:06:46 - Gen-2 shark kills janice
* 01:13:45 - Random shot of a shark fin
* 01:17:00 - Gen-2 eats Scoggins
* 01:21:00 - Dr. Susan battles and kills a Gen 1 shark
* 01:27:00 - The Gen-2 bites Preacher and gets stabbed in the eye with a crucifix
* 01:33:30 - Gen-2 eats Susan
* 01:35:50 - Gen-2 shark blows up 

It’s worth noting that the shark films ranked 11-15 have a higher Tomatometer, IMDb, and Letterboxd averages than the films ranked 1-5. So, being the MOST shark films isn’t always ideal. 

**11-15 ranked movies - Shark Night, Open Water, The Reef, 47 Meters Down, Jaws**

* Tomatometer Average - 63.8
* IMDb Average - 5.88
* Letterboxd Average - 2.92

**1-5 ranked movies - Deep Blue Sea, Meg 2: The Trench, The Meg, Bait 3D. 47 Meters Down: Uncaged**

* Tomatometer Average - 44.4
* IMDb Average - 5.36
* Letterboxd Average - 2.34

**Here are three highest ranked film in each category.**

||
||
|Movies|Tomatometer|IMDb|Letterboxd|
|Deep Blue Sea|60|5.9|2.8|
|The Meg 2: The Trench|27|5|2|
|The Meg|47|5.7|2.3|
|Bait|44|5.2|2.5|
|47 Meters Down: Uncaged|44|5|2.1|

|The Reef|79|5.8|2.7|
|47 Meters Down|53|5.6|2.5|
|Jaws|97|8.1|4|

**Conclusion** - *Jaws* is the best shark movie and *Deep Blue Sea* is the MOST shark movie.

venom2,carnage,1d1po8t,The Big Heat (1953) and other startling Film Noir,"I’m a huge film noir fan, but even then I rate most of them 6/10. It’s rare I find one that really wakes me up.

Well last night I finally got woken up. I mostly think of Glen Ford as Clark Kent’s dad (having seen Superman (1978) at a formative age, and not being very much into westerns), so even though I knew The Big Heat by reputation, I’d never sat down to watch it. I’m glad I finally did!

Fritz Lang directs a brutal film about a cop whose self-righteous sense of morality leads to carnage. He basically throws everyone he meets into harm’s way, including an aged bookkeeper. 

It’s also amazing how many things Lang slipped through the production code. The great Lee Marvin gets to be particularly cruel.

Here are the only other noir films I’ve rated 9/10 or higher:
Night of the Hunter (1955)
Touch of Evil (1958)
Double Indemnity (1944)
The Killing (1956)
Kiss Me Deadly (1955)

I’ve seen dozens of others that I’d rate 8/10, but the above are the ones that pushed past that, due to one reason or another.

Any recommendations for other classic (not modern) film noir that go the extra mile?

venom2,carnage,1bpo4wl,The Water Jug — No Country for Old Men (2007),"There are so many compelling scenes in this movie, such as the coin toss, the ending monologue from the sheriff, the discussion between Carla Jean and Anton Chigurh. But the scene that stuck with me the most is when Llewelyn took the water jug to the dying man in the desert.

He knew what he was going into. He already saw the carnage, the greed that must’ve been involved in such a terrible massacre. Yet, Llewelyn still returned to that site to give the man water. You could say he felt guilty, but his characterization wasn’t of someone who fell on one side or the other of altruism. He was just a dude, in the wrong place at the wrong time, and someone who feels *real*. Maybe Llewelyn is a symbol of inherent human good, or he was terribly curious to see what came of that situation, or maybe he was bored & wanted adventure in his life. If you compare him to the sheriff, who’s completely bored in retirement and reduced to memory and dreams, Llewelyn doing things with no regard for safety or future speaks to the painful idleness of having no particular duty on any given day.

I’m curious to know what other people’s interpretations are of Llewelyn bringing water to the dying man. After all, the movie’s events are set in motion because of this event.",6,10,1711604883.0,2024-03-28 05:48:03,False
venom2,carnage,1blfcn8,What historical events/figures would you want to see adapted into a movie?,"I think a movie regarding the Spanish conquest of the Inca empire would be fantastic. Just imagine the modern-day cinematography depicting the Battle of Cajamarca and with an R rating, lots of carnage can be shown of the fighting between the Spaniards and the Incas as well as the execution of Athualpa by strangulation.

Battle Of Cajamarca directed by a director who has studied the Spanish conquest would be fantastic.

Another event that should be adapted into a movie would have to be The Battle Of Little Bighorn in 1876. With modern day cinematography, just imagine a battle between the U.S. Forces and the Native American forces lead by Sioux leader Sitting Bull. I think Daniel Day Lewis should play General Custer",25,49,1711155007.0,2024-03-23 00:50:07,False
venom2,carnage,1as5s4d,"Why are blockbusters under Tom Rothman's studios so afraid of being, uh, BLOCKBUSTERS?","Context: Tom Rothman is the current chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment and was previously in the same position over at 20th Century Fox.

I looked at the blockbusters produced under his regime and there's this cheap feeling to all of the tentpoles under his regimes. If these films aren't co-productions, you can tell immediately that they are cheaply made and produced out of spite with no actual regards to the source material. 

Some of these examples include Alien vs. Predator, Dragonball Evolution, X-Men Origin: Wolverine, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer over at 20CF, and later Venom: Let There be Carnage, 65, Saint Seiya, Morbius and lately, Madame Web.

I can understand that Fox did not have the capacity to compete with its competition as it drags on (as evident by the Disney acquisition), but at Sony, it's an entirely different story. Sony by all account is about as comparable to Disney and Comcast in size and scale, yet their movie studios continue to suck at spearheading strong franchises. 

There should be zero reasons where older movies in their catalog, such as Raimi's Spider-Man 3, continue to look better than modern production under the same company. They clearly have the resources (their electronic department is second to none) to deliver, yet they utterly fails at capitalizing on resources from their sister divisions and needs someone outside to reign them in.",0,7,1708080708.0,2024-02-16 10:51:48,False

venom2,carnage,18nhe61,"If you're looking forward to Alex Garland's 'Civil War,' consider giving 'Bushwick' (2017) a try.","With Alex Garland's *Civil War* on the way, it got me thinking of another movie I had seen about a second American Civil War called *Bushwick*.

I first checked it out because it's co-written by Nick Damici (*Stake Land*, *Cold in July*, *Hap and Leonard*) and stars Dave Bautista, and I was shocked that I hadn't heard of it. [The trailers do it a disservice by making it look goofy in tone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMi7A20TXoU), and while it *is* a little tongue-in-cheek at times, I thought it was actually a really effective take on a civil war/invasion scenario. Especially considering its more modest budget.

It's a pretty basic story: Lucy (Brittany Snow) is bringing her boyfriend home to meet her family in Bushwick when an invasion breaks out before they can even leave the train station. Fleeing the sudden carnage, she meets up with Stupe (Dave Bautista), a janitor and former corpsman who's on his way out of the neighborhood. From there, they're mostly just trying to survive and following rumors of an evacuation zone, all while the city gradually begins to organize and push back against the invaders.

It's not a perfect film by any means (the definition of a ""It's Not Gonna Win Any Awards"" kind of film), but it's an enjoyable one. Its use of *long* tracking shots throughout the duration (with only a few hard cuts) gives the feeling of *Red Dawn* mixed with *Cloverfield*, which heightens a lot of the action. I do think the movie ends *very* abruptly and maybe tries to explain the civil war a bit too much, but despite that it's a fun ride.",73,23,1703143762.0,2023-12-21 07:29:22,False

**- Forbidden Planet (1956)**: Walter pidgeon, anne francis, leslie nielsen. The older the movie gets the more the script becomes more of a warning sign where the red line in scientific progress is.

venom2,carnage,12v3q1w,What 'genre' is a film like 'The Man from Earth' and what are more films like it?,"I just saw 'Mass' and the style of the film reminded me of 'The Man from Earth'.

It practically feels like a stage play on film, and in some cases, I think they are adaptations of stage plays to film.  Its films where the actors performances and the writing are doing 99% of the heavy lifting. The budgets are typically pretty tiny, the film is practically set in a single room with a group of characters that are strongly defined and have varying views on a scenario or differing backgrounds and they talk through a problem or circumstance, each giving their own unique and really well thought out perspectives that make the characters feel very real.

What is the genre for a film like this? I want to find more but I don't know how to search for it. 

Here's a list of films that come to my mind:

- [12 Angry Men](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/)

- [The Man from Earth](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/)

- [Mass](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11389748/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2)

- [Carnage](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1692486/)

I'm sure there's more I've seen but those are the ones that come to mind and damn, do I want more of it. I find them so captivating.

venom2,carnage,127ynqo,I highly recommend Becky,"This movie, is damn fucking good. Idk why the hell it didn't get a theatrical release. Was it because of Covid?

This is a really good movie. First time I saw it, I went in expecting something incredibly fucking stupid, but was so damn surprised. 

You got a rebellious and temperamental teen who went through shit that does happen, especially to kids that age. Her mother died from cancer, and her dad was moving on, announces he is engaged, and she's having none of it.

Then these neo nazis arrive, led by Kevin James in his, I think, his first serious role he's ever done, and he's totally an irredeemable villain and he knocks it out of the park. Given he and his comrades arrive at the wrong place and the very wrong time for Becky, she takes her rage out on all of them in a pretty damn carnage candy filled movie

Also....Lulu Wilson...PHENOMENAL child actress. I mean she's 17 now, but every time I've seen her in something, she's fucking excellent. She was awesome in that Ouija: Origin of Evil and the Haunting at Hill House 

Keep in mind, she isn't overpowered. She gets knocked down and beaten some. Yeah, that's another thing, this movie has balls with certain things and doesn't really pull any punches. Kids, I'm talking slightly younger than Becky, get murdered off screen, and dogs go through harm, one of them killed.

I'm also happy to know there is a sequel on the way, saw the preview and it looks cool af. Sean William Scott is also in it 😎",3,11,1680295455.0,2023-03-31 21:44:15,False

venom2,carnage,11axosm,M3GAN: Unrated,"This movie is on Peacock right now. I did see the PG-13 version in theaters, and I just watched the unrated cut just now. It feels about the same as the pg-13. It earns the R rating, but not to a great amount. 

There's like six more f-bombs included and the same amount of kills, just bloodier. Like the ear scene, close-up shot. The scene with the dog owner, it briefly shows her face being affected by the acid. And the scene with the boss and the employee, probably the bloodiest scene in the movie. 

I did appreciate seeing it, and I appreciate that they gave a shit enough to release the cut that was originally gonna be in theaters if not for the internet's meme galore...

venom2,carnage,10sjfgf,Why is it so popular in movies for the love interest to already have a jerk boyfriend?,"You know the trope love interest has a terrible jerk of a significant other they have to leave so they can get with the main character. They are almost always obvious $ssholes to make the main character look like the better option. I don't know why they do this and it usually makes the love interest look like a jerk too because they'll see what their significant other is doing and usually do little to nothing to stop it. 99% of time it's a bland female love interest with a jerk of a boyfriend that's usually a jock stereotype with more aggression than sense though I have seen it a few times with oblivious guy has a mean girl style girlfriend who's awful to everyone around her. I just generally don't understand the draw of this trope why would a character want to date someone who's already VOLUNTARILY swapping spit with the person that bullys the character
(This is not to be confused with the abusive significant other trope which is a completely different thing)


I got into this line of thought because I'm sick and watching nostalgic movies to distract myself currently watching AVP requiem and I'm constantly annoyed that they keep cutting away from the carnage to the awful ""Love"" story between bland ""sexy"" blonde, her sh**ty boyfriend, and even more bland main character who's only character traits seems to be 'wants to date the blonde' and has a convict brother",66,168,1675428198.0,2023-02-03 12:43:18,False

With Disney and Hollywood doing constant remakes of classic movies, I've heard it said that they should instead remake shitty movies and give them another chance. 

The first one that comes to mind as a really recent movie, is Venom Let there be Carnage. Had such potential but it was honestly so boring and lame imo.

venom2,carnage,vb3mmm,What movie did you or someone else miss the point of?,"For me it was Law Abiding Citizen.

I saw this in theaters when it came out and the entire movie me and my friends were glued to the screen, it was an amazing ride the entire movie. But then the ending happened and me and all my friends looked at each other as the lights came up and we were ranged from confused to pissed.

It became a running joke between us all that it was ""the best movie Jaime Foxx ruined"". Fast forward to a few years later and I'm watching it at home for like the 15th time and I realize something about the movie (spoilers):

>!Shelton WANTED Nick to kill him and stop him. I was so blindsided by the action and the dialogue and the dark humor throughout that my dumb lizard brain didn't pick up on how desperate Shelton wanted Nick to do whatever was necessary to get justice, and that meant killing Shelton to stop his murders. For so long I was angry with the way Nick was able to ""fool"" Shelton and why Shelton didn't have more contingencies to be able to continue his carnage, when all along Shelton wanted to be stopped in order to change the way Nick thought about justice. !<

Badass! Once the german soldiers devious plan is foiled, and the nazi-killin’ starts, it almost gives off this proto-Assault on Precinct 13 kinda vibe. The siege action is absolutely phenomenal. Fantastic mayhem.

venom2,carnage,ujrgm5,"2013's Carrie isn't bad, but it pales in comparison to the 1976 original","After watching the original 1976 adaptation of Stephen King's novel Carrie, I decided to check out the [2013 version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSn7JyijA8k&ab_channel=MovieclipsTrailers) not knowing what to expect. While I didn't find it to be bad, I left underwhelmed. It just didn't have the impact Brian De Palma's version did. 

Let's start with the cast. While there are talented actors in this movie like Chloë Grace Moretz, Julianne Moore, and Ansel Elgort, nobody here gives as a memorable performance as in the original. I'll never forget Sissy Spacek [wide-eyed stare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xe0BayQQuc&ab_channel=Darkscott1) during the climax, or how [insane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12wHDwNXBL0&ab_channel=Movieclips) Piper Laurie was as Carrie's mother, or [Betty Buckley taking no shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCdGSA7-Fds&ab_channel=FrancoSeguer) from any of teenage girls. There is just no comparison.

There's more I could get into, but I'll just end with the movie's climax. It's entertaining, but I didn't find it hitting me the same way De Palma's version did. In that movie, Carrie's wrath was more of a defense mechanism that she had no control other. That's why EVERYBODY in that gym got killed. It didn't matter if they tormented Carrie, supported her, or had no interaction with her. Nobody was spared. Even Miss Collins, the only person in her corner, got axed off. For me, that's what made that scene intense and scary. 

In the 2013 version, it's clear [Carrie has more control of her powers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_3kbJmhcnw&ab_channel=Darkscott1) and that just made everything less suspenseful. I felt like I was watching Jean Grey or Scarlet Witch going insane, but less memorable. Sure we see students getting trampled and Carrie whipping people with live electrical wires but unlike the original, some people escape the carnage including Miss Collins (this time played by Judy Greer). 

So yeah, 2013's Carrie isn't the worst remake I've seen but it feels like the most pointless. Sure you see new stuff like Carrie's birth and Margaret White working at a clothing store, but there isn't much here to justify a new version other than cashing in on the IP. I think this movie is a ""one and done"" watch for me while the 1976 version will be added to my rewatch rotation in the future.",42,33,1651854925.0,2022-05-06 17:35:25,False
venom2,carnage,uejjuw,The climax to Carrie (1976) is now one of my favorites,"After watching [Carrie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSF6WVx_Tdo&ab_channel=TheTrailerGuy) for the first time, it made me regret not getting to this movie sooner. It also made me want to marathon every single Brian De Palma movie I haven't seen yet. 

Now I haven't read the original Stephen King novel, but what really encouraged me to watch this movie is that Quentin Tarantino included it as one his favorite movies in a [2012 Sight & Sound directors' poll](https://web.archive.org/web/20120825234900/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/voter/1134) and after watching it, I can see why.

Even leading up to the climax, I was on board with this film. The highlights included watching Piper Laurie's [performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12wHDwNXBL0&ab_channel=Movieclips) as Carrie's super-religious and unhinged mother. I also really liked Betty Buckley as the gym teacher Miss Collins acting as one of the only characters who was in Carrie's corner. My favorite scene with her involved [not taking any shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCdGSA7-Fds&ab_channel=FrancoSeguer) from the girls bullying Carrie. That woman is a straight savage. 

Then we get to the [climax at the prom.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xe0BayQQuc&ab_channel=Darkscott1) We know the pig blood is going to dumped on Carrie and her  psychic powers are going to be unleashed, but the tension just keeps building and building. We get to see Carrie start to come a little out of her shell, the prom king/queen vote being rigged, and all the teens getting into place to pull off prank, and then it happens.

I love how everything goes silent except for the sound effects; the dripping of the blood and the clanging of the bucket as Carrie collects her thoughts about what just happened. Then Sissy Spacek goes wide-eyed and unleashes hell on everyone. The screen splits and we see all the doors close and lights go out. Then it's constant carnage. People are getting blasted with a firehouse and flying everywhere, a teacher gets electrocuted by a microphone, and even Miss Collins, the only character who stood up for Carrie, gets axed off. Nobody is spared in the destruction. And to add to it all, the stage gets engulfed in flames, creating one of the best images in the movie. 

I also love the shocked and horrified looks of John Travolta and Nancy Allen as they watch from a window. They also get killed off when try to run over Carrie in a car. [It doesn't go so well for them.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgBvOoE5uG0&ab_channel=Movieclips) Carrie is practically in god-mode at this point. She could move an eyebrow and you'd be completely decimated. Maybe this was one of the inspirations behind the climax to [Inglourious Basterds.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx-rrBv2lyc&ab_channel=S.MAlkf) I felt the same amount of tension and the payoff is also widely entertaining. 

So yeah, I love this movie. Now I'm going to check out the 2013 version with Chloë Grace Moretz. Let's see if it holds a candle to the original.",46,20,1651230832.0,2022-04-29 12:13:52,False

thewildrobot,the wild robot movie,1jzkg3c,What's with the failure of the Weird West subgenre?,"By weird west, I'm referring to Western movies with some sort of speculative twist (ex. Jonah Hex, Cowboys and Aliens, Wild Wild West, etc.).

These movies are pretty much guaranteed to underperform, and I wonder if it's because the audience simply isn't there for this genre of film, or if there just hasn't been a good enough version, either critically or commercially, to excite moviegoers.

It might also be something of a self-fulfilling prophesy, where one weird west movie comes out and bombs, so studios assume audiences hate weird west movies, so weird west movies don't get made. 

Or maybe it's something else entirely. Is this a dead genre? Or, more thematically, an undead one. Would it just take one well-done, well-received weird west film to ignite the genre?

TL;DR: Are weird west movies box office poison or has there just not been a good one?",0,55,1744696239.0,2025-04-15 06:50:39,False
thewildrobot,the wild robot movie,1jyhcp4,Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid appreciation post,"I'm watching this movie again and I just... wow.

I. Love. This. Film.

I grew up in a ""movie family,"" with my dad quoting both famous and obscure films left and right throughout my childhood. He quoted this one *a lot* (specifically, ""I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid when I said you were cheating""). Those quotes often led to the realization that his delivery sometimes was considerably better than the reality of whatever movie he was quoting, LOL

This, this right here, is the #1 exception. 

When I finally sat down and watched it at 16 or 17 (early aughts), I remember being blown away. This is one of the only movies that has retained that wonder for me over 20+ years now - I turn 40 this year.

I'm not saying there aren't absolutely valid criticisms. There are. But this post is just about appreciating a film where, IMHO, the actors and the script and the cinematography are all nearly perfect.

And the LINES. Just... I could quote this film forever. Which is wild because the script is in itself pretty sparse.

""I CAN'T SWIM!""
""Who ARE those guys?""
""You just keep thinkin', Butch, that's what you're good at.""
""Rules! In a knife fight?!""

thewildrobot,the wild robot movie,1jxusxf,The Martian (2015). My watch-along write up.,"This week I’m going to try something new. Let’s call it stream of conscious watch-along writing. I’m planning to watch the 2015 film ‘The Martian’ starring Matt Damon and directed by Ridley Scott. I’m going to do this review / write up while watching. I do plan to go back and make edits after the movie is over, but I just want to try this out, you know, see how it goes. I’ve seen the movie before, I think at least twice, but it may be more times, and I remember it being very fun and entertaining. It’s ‘Cast Away’, but on Mars, and we get to see the people who aren’t stranded and their efforts in helping get Matt Damon home. Alright, let’s push play.

The sun rises over the red planet to start, we get to our setting right away. No talk about the mission beforehand. Just here on Mars. We don’t need any exposition. We don’t need to have Matt talk to family on Earth before leaving. We don’t need some worried scientist talking about how it could be dangerous. The audience is smart enough to know, going to Mars is dangerous, (just ask Schwarzenegger). I do like that we get an idea of Matt’s character right away. Quick, goofy, a smart-ass. . . fitting.

Damn, that storm looks bad. The characters use some science words, but it’s not hard to follow. We get it, it’s dangerous out there in a sand storm on Mars. The movie is doing an excellent job showing that leaving Matt behind was the choice that had to be made. If they didn’t leave, they all would have died, and the probability that Matt is alive was definitely about as low as it could get. We know he’s alive, but yeah, you know, if he was dead, what would the movie be? Because of this, there really isn’t any emotion felt, I know he’s not dead.

Okay, next scene. Look at that, Matt isn’t dead, but he’s in danger. I’ve woken up in strange places before, but not *that* strange. 

Mars kinda looks like New Mexico.

Okay, this sort of thing I’ve seen before in a few films, and it always works. The self-surgery. I’m not too squeamish with blood, but yeah, the idea of having to perform surgery on yourself is very very frightening. Chills are happening, it’s almost like you can feel the pain yourself. I mean, of course not really, but the noises are terrible. Ewww. And Matt looks like he’s in soooo much pain, and he’s really fucking sweaty. Sigh…it’s over now.

Ah yes, the video journal. Great device for film making. When I’m by myself, I don’t really talk. But we can’t have our main character in silence the whole time. Having him to the video journal is a pretty great way to have the audience feel like Matt is interacting with us, even though he’s alone. It’s also great that in the first video, he lays out all the things that can go wrong, and what he’s up against. It also shows that he’s smart, which works for me. I remember Matt from ‘Good Will Hunting’ where he was wicked-smaht. 

And here is a montage, you need to collect literal shit to grow some food. Set up a greenhouse, and do the work, all the work. Haha, good line: “Fuck you Mars.”

I’m realizing now what I really like about this movie. It’s about problem solving. I studied physics in college because I like knowing how things work. I was good at it because I enjoy problem solving. Now I work on cars, and my favorite part is the diagnostic side of it all. You know, problem solving. Here, when Matt is all alone, we just get to see a really smart guy problem solve, over and over again. Yeah, he makes some mistakes, but he does a really good job for the most part.

Lol, Harry from ‘Dumb and Dumber’ is giving a eulogy. He’s really come a long way from dog groomer to head of NASA. Off to someone working alone at mission control, and yay! They figured it out, Matt’s alive. I don’t like this side of the story though. The whole politics of running NASA and public relations issues. Also, unfortunately, Harry (I’m just going to keep calling him that) is our ‘bad guy’. I guess the movie needs someone, but really, there is no bad guy in the movie. It’s just man vs nature.

And we're back with Matt, the scenes with him being a smart-ass, and smart, are definitely my favorite parts of the film. 

Love the running gag of disco music.

Benedict Wong! I like him in everything. Really excellent cast in the movie, kind of an all-star list of people you know from something else. Also, pretty sure Sean Bean doesn’t die in this one.

This reveal of Pathfinder is awesome too. Getting to use real life objects gives the audience a good feeling. Is it nostalgia? Sort of. I think yes. It’s quite cool that Matt gets it working and finds a way to communicate. But the communications issues are brought up right away. Another time to solve some problems.

The feeling of communication with text for the first time in how long? Great job in acting by Matt when the first text comes through. 

I don’t understand why they need to tell the crew that Matt is alive, it seems like it would be smart to tell them after they are safe themselves. I see the logic, but I guess it’s not considered the moral thing to do. I don’t get it. I know that later in the movie the crew is integral in  saving Matt, but until they were needed to execute a plan, why get them all worked up and distracted while they are trying to survive in outer space themselves. Then having Jessica Chastain be all hard on herself feels uneared. She did the smartest thing during the sand storm and saved everyone else they knew were still alive. I guess movies are supposed to have emotion, but this one didn’t really work on me.

And here it is, the big thing that can go wrong goes wrong. There’s an explosion. Quite stressful, especially with the robot voice talking about oxygen levels and the beeping. Duct taping your helmet closed in order to not die on Mars must suck to have to do. We know this to be true, but literally no one has ever had to do it. Like, how does Matt get out of this one? His food is gone. This doesn’t feel like fun problem solving time anymore. It really seems like Matt is going to die now. But luckily, we are watching a movie.

Love the edit to just show Wong after the call. ‘I’m going to need a change of clothes.’ is quite the funny line. Well delivered.

So the pacing of the movie is good overall, but I’m noticing that by typing while watching, there are some slow moments, and definitely parts where I’m less engaged, that are harder to write about. Also, now that Matt has fixed the habitat where he can live, I’m feeling like he did it a little too easily. And from Matt counting potatoes, we go over to Mr Glover and his kooky character. I remember not really liking this part, he’s a little too out there compared to everyone else in the movie, kind of like he doesn’t belong. Then his idea about the sling shot is really something nobody else has thought of? I’ve seen Armageddon, don’t they do this maneuver around the moon to get to the asteroid?

Matt’s going to hate potatoes for the rest of his life once he gets home.

And here we are again. It seems hopeless. Like really, he doesn’t have enough food. It’s pretty crazy how much life can come down to not having enough potatoes. I wonder if the writer was Irish?

Ha, the Lord of the Rings references with Sean Bean in the room. Maybe the movies didn’t exist in this cinematic universe and they only had the books. Then we have the meeting, and then we get the crew deciding to do it, and then we finally get back to Mars. We’re going to try and save his life after all. Who would have guessed?!

Nice to have a movie where China and USA are working together to save Matt Damon. Also, good use of the song ‘Starman’.

Love the space pirate bit too. And it’s nice to get the breakdown from Matt about how it all works.

Alright, now we get the breakdown from Wong and Sean and how crazy it gets. I love it. The insanity of having to figure it out sometimes has crazy solutions. 

The rescue operation is pretty miraculous. Having Matt pass out during it is a pretty nice touch. Now talking about ripping his space suit on purpose, and the crew making a bomb in space. More problem solving. And then they get him and we get to see the celebration at mission control. I’ve never disliked seeing the celebration in a control room. It is always a feel good scene in any movie.

I do like how the movie ends really damn fast. He made it, movie done. But first we get a pretty great monologue from Matt.

Okay. Movie over. That was fun to do. I don’t think I’ll be doing it again, but hope you had fun reading it.

thewildrobot,the wild robot movie,1jxr17i,My review of the electric state,"It was very enjoyable. Good acting, loveable characters and intriguing plot. I tried to avoid spoilers so the only complaint I heard was that it wasn't close enough to the source material but I feel that it stayed close enough whilst having it's own personality, it had gritty elements that the source material had, but it put it's own twist on the story with brighter colours and action scenes that mashed together into a roller coaster of themes and emotions.
I only have two complaints about it, number one is that the butcher gave up to easily, he switched sides after one conversation with an ally he didn't  like. If he had several and/or one with a robot then it would have been fine. It wasn't enough to ruin the movie, all movies have problems no matter how good they are, star wars didn't explain why the death star was designed with such a big exhaust port that goes directly to the core with no contingency measures until 40 years later.
My other complaint is that I don't think taco bot had to die, you would get attached to him enough for his death to upset you but not enough to make it feel necessary. It just felt needless and annoying.
Overall it was a good movie worth rewatching but not absolutely amazing or perfect.",0,2,1744490919.0,2025-04-12 21:48:39,False

     * Critics Consensus: Thematically rich as a Great American Novel and just plain rip-roaring fun, writer-director Ryan Coogler's first original blockbuster reveals the full scope of his singular imagination with unforgettable panache.

Reviews:

[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/sinners-review-michael-b-jordan-ryan-coogler-1236363344/) (70):

>It's vibrant and richly acted, and also a wild throat-ripping blowout. But though overloaded at times, it's the rare mainstream horror film that's about something weighty and soulful: the wages of sin in Black America.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/04/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-x-2-reteam-vampire-movie-1236365142/):

>*Sinners* marks another strong reason why Ryan Coogler is at the top of his generation of filmmakers, and Jordan continues to show why he is a real deal movie star.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/sinners-review-michael-b-jordan-ryan-coogler-horror-1236186742/) (90):

>The movie is smart horror, even poetic at times, with much to say about race and spiritual freedom. It’s not in the Jordan Peele league in terms of welding social commentary to bone-chilling fear. But *Sinners* is a unique experience, unlike anything either the director or Jordan has done before.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1831292/sinners-ryan-coogler-movie-review/) (9/10):

>""Sinners"" is several things at once — a monster movie, a blood-soaked action film, a sexy and sensual thriller, and a one-location horror flick as intense and paranoia-driven as anything from the original ""Assault on Precinct 13"" or Quentin Tarantino's filmography – but its greatest strength comes from how well Coogler blends every big idea on his mind.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-vampire-horror/) (88):

>“Sinners” is a bloody, brilliant motion picture. Ryan Coogler finds within the vampire genre an ethereal thematic throughline; and within the music genre a disturbing, tempting monster. Stunningly photographed, engrossing cinema — epic to the point where it seemingly never ends, which is undeniably indulgent, but no great sin. This is a film about indulgence, the power indulgence wields and the dangers indulgence invites into our lives. It’s a sweaty, intoxicating, all-nighter of a movie, and its allure cannot be denied.

[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/sinners-movie-2025-michael-b-jordan-cast-ryan-coogler-b2730833.html) (4/5):

>If cinema weren’t in such a sickly state, *Sinners*’s electric fusion of genres – historical epic, horror, and squelchy actioner – would be a guaranteed box office sensation. Instead, the film arrives with an uneasy sense that this is some kind of final stand for original ideas. One can only hope audiences recognise its bounty of riches.

[The Guardian](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sinners/) (3/5):

>For many, the movie could as well do without the supernatural element, and I admit I’m one of them; I’d prefer to see a real story with real jeopardy work itself out. But there is energy and comic-book brashness

Vanity Fair (80):

> Sinners is propulsive and stirring entertainment, messy but always compelling. The film’s fascinating array of genres and tropes and ideas swirls together in a way that is, I suppose, singularly American.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-vampire-movie-1235114698/) (83):

>Sinners is nothing if not a film about genre, and the distinctly American imperative of cross-pollinating between them to create something that feels new and old — high and low — at the same time.

thewildrobot,the wild robot movie,1jw0hrw,What are some of your favorite movie trailers?,"Here are some of mine:


Cruel Intentions: https://youtu.be/UzlKsS-IhEo?si=73QEZnZkFHTsKmat
 

- I like the way they blend music, and SMG is such a snake in this ... I love that it comes through in the feel of the movie. And gotta love that end cap scene, like trailers do. It's so representative of the movie and how tawdy and scandalous these characters are


Black Snake Moan: 
https://youtu.be/j7Z7Cf9IDGw?si=CFIIrIOBp9Zm0jSr


- I know a lot of people think this trailer gave the wrong impression of what the movie was actually about, but after seeing it I think it perfectly encapsulates what it's about. And the music is really well interwoven in it. But in particular I absolutely love the montage of Rhey giving into her vices, which I think a lot of us can relate to in one way or another for a lot of reasons. It's so colorful and punchy, and it's really cool how they edited it to mirror Rhey, giving it that pulpy vibe that's inherent in the movie's set up. Lastly, I think it's representative of how we glorify/romanticize hedonism (if that's the right word), despite how it might negatively impact our lives. 


Suicide Squad:
https://youtu.be/PLLQK9la6Go?si=wRjC2ZoWobUiK5dw


- Who didn't like this trailer? There's something special about it, with the song they used ... You can sense how impactful it should have been. But I personally suspect the reason people really vibe with it (and as is evidenced given the popularity of the character) is because it plays as though it's a story mainly revolving around Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. I think there's something endearing about seeing people who exhibit different styles and qualities, which you get a wealth of here. It deepens people's sense of mystery and a person's complexity, but overall I think it's because she's high spirited, wild and free, while being kinda crazy that people see themselves (or who they wish they could be) in her ... A life force of epic proportions, going through the motions, but beautiful in their own peculiar and unique way. It's too bad the movie couldn't live up to this trailer. 

High Tension:
https://youtu.be/ZsfqXekOvJQ?si=5KxgKkZHuIdRNAHN

- This is a great little trailer for a relatively obscure horror movie. The cover song really makes it, as does the editing. 
Note that this isn't the exact trailer I was looking for, which lessens it's impact as an audio-visual wonder in my book. There's something missing right before it cuts to the chorus and things ramp up ... The original trailer was less jarring than that. ",12,57,1744298412.0,2025-04-10 16:20:12,False
thewildrobot,the wild robot movie,1jvnogf,The Electric State (2025),"I know that this movie has already been discussed here at Reddit, but...

The Electric State (2025) was... not great, not horrible.  It was edgy on an adult level and had some adult language and disturbing scenarios (the kid contained in the chamber with tubes plugged into his dead, Matrix-style)... hence the PG-13 rating.  But the movie just didn't seem *to know what it was*.

I believe that there was a very good rated-PG kids movie buried inside The Electric State.  It had fantastic CGI robots with great personalities.  It could have been an excellent family/kids movie.  If they'd just had more fun with the robots and kept it PG and had more non-edgy humor.  I love dark/edgy movies, but this felt like it wanted to be a live-action and less-edgy Animatrix with a fun! ending... but it just couldn't help itself, and be mostly kinda pleasant-shitty. 

The Russo brothers can do better.

thewildrobot,the wild robot movie,1juswsc,The T-Rex in Jurassic Park is the Greatest Special Effect Ever - And I'm not Talking About the CGI One,"So, *Jurassic Park* is a very important movie to me. I'm in my early thirties, and I've grown up watching this movie, as well as it's first two sequels (I'm admittedly not a fan of the *World* sequels). I've seen it more than any other movie by far, and it never ceases to amaze me. When I was a kid in the 90's, entering the Jurassic Park section at Universal Studios in Florida was a magical experience as they perfectly re-captured the feeling of entering the park from the movie. The music still gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. My favorite dinosaur? It's got to be the T-Rex. And I truly believe it's the greatest special effect that was ever in a movie, or ever will be. And I'm not talking about the CGI one - despite being a ground breaking achievement, it doesn't hold a candle to the life sized animatronic Stan Winston Studios created for the movie.

Unfortunately, over the years, I feel like the life sized animatronic T-Rex has been overshadowed by the CGI one. Sure, it a huge step in a totally new form of digital effects. And sure, 30 years later and it still manages to hold up due to Spielberg's restraint and cleaver usage of the medium. But having an actual 30 foot tall [T-Rex sized robot that looks and moves as realistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFTsYGgdR9k&t=59s) as it did is just jaw dropping. I'm currently watching the Industrial Light & Magic docuseries on Disney+ and they, along with everyone else in other similar videos discussing the cultural impact of the film, always highlight the CGI effects and don't seem to spend as much time discussing how incredible the practical effects were. 

During quarantine, I was lucky enough to interview Stan Winston's son Matthew Winston regarding his father's legacy. He told me how he was present on set for multiple movies his father worked on, and got to be up close and personal with Aliens, Predators, Terminators, Pumpkinheads and everything in between, but nothing was as incredible and surrealistic as seeing the T-Rex in all it's glory. I could only imagine how mystifying that would have been.

They went even bigger with *The Lost World* by having two T-Rexes. Say what you will about that movie, but they absolutely devoured every scene they were in (sharing a bite with each other is one of the coolest deaths in the series). While the third movie continued the practical dinos, the modern trilogy either seemed to lean fully into CGI (which is already dated) or used practical effects that were somehow less effective than ones used decades prior. 

How do you feel about the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park? Have they left a huge impression on you? Do you think any special effect has come close? I personally think Gollum in LOTR would be the most noteworthy, and I also think the practical effects, costumes, set design, etc in that trilogy is phenomenal as well.

I loved the movie, it was a beautiful slice of life adventure that followed a woman and her internal strifes as she ages into the milestone age of 30. She reflect on her shortcomings and her inability to commit (altho she herself doesn’t realize this). I enjoyed all the characters. 


But honestly, Julie is an awful individual. She doesn’t commit to a career path, to a man, or even to her own ambitious. She is riddled with emotional issues that NEED to be discussed and comes from a long line of unhappy women. I understand WHY she is the way she is. Every Reddit thread I see of the movie has people praise this character which is wild to me. 


She emotionally cheats on the older dude; aborts her child; does see the guy die of cancer; never resolves her relationship with her father; and is just way too cagey and avoidant to do anything about her life. By all accounts she’s an awful person, and if the gender was swapped, I don’t think I’d see so many praises.

thewildrobot,the wild robot movie,1jtuoqr,How a friendly grandmother's daily walks indirectly gave WALL-E its voice,"In the fall of 2004, I had just moved 2000 miles to northern California to start my new job in the animation industry. Each weekend, I would visit my grandmother who lived in Marin county and spend the day with her. My grandmother was an amazing woman, she was the type who kept detailed notes of all your preferences so she could provide the best experiences for her guests. For example, each time I visited, she had made my favorite sandwich with the exact proportions of condiments and meats I preferred with absolutely no tomatoes anywhere nearby, purchased my favorite soda (she would never keep soda in her own fridge as she did not like it, so she always bough one fresh the day I visited), and have a selection of candies I liked (or at least which she remember I liked from when I was 5). One of our favorite things to do together was walk through her neighborhood and talk with her neighbors. My grandmother lived in her neighborhood for nearly 30 years, and her husband had lived there for 80 years, so between them they knew the history of every house and of her friends inside. She walked her neighborhood every day, and each time she saw someone outside of their house she would stop and talk with them. If she knew someone’s daily schedule she would time her walks so that she would see them outside and conveniently have their favorite cookies with her to give to them. Each weekend, my grandmother and I would walk the one mile loop and she gave me updates on all her neighbors, which numbered at least 30 families. As we passed each house, she’d tell me whose kids just got into college, who changed jobs, the successes of each kid, their favorite foods and movies, etc. She was like a living newsletter, and I loved hearing my grandmother excitedly tell each story. 


One day during our walk, she was giving me the latest scoop on her neighbor Ben, a kind man with a wonderful wife and lovely young daughter, who creates sounds for movies. As we approached Ben’s house, a car pulled into his driveway directly in front of us and a man in his 50s stepped out. “Oh, hey, that’s Ben,” she said, waving to him as he walked to open his passenger-side door. He turned to us, smiled, said “hi”, and as he opened his passenger-side door, out tumbled his laptop, crashing onto the concrete with the screen still open. He shouted a boomer-sanitized expletive and I instinctively rushed over to help him pick it up. As I did, I glanced at the screen.

What I saw stopped me in my tracks: two figures were battling with glowing swords over a river of lava. I immediately recognized it as the ending duel from *Episode III: Revenge of the Sith*. Now, this was September 2004 and that movie wasn’t due out until May 2005. This was the biggest movie everyone was talking about and counting down to. Fans knew that the end of the movie was supposed to be a climatic duel between Obi-wan and Anakin on the lava planet of Mustafar which leads to the creation of Darth Vader as we know him, but everyone was guessing how it would happen. Any hint of leaks were highly valued and reported on sites like Ain’t It Cool News, Dark Horizons, and ComingSoon.net. A modern equivalent would be to unknowingly stumble upon the “On your left” portals scene from Avengers Endgame 8 months before it came out. And here I was, staring at the scene I had been imagining ever since I read about Darth Vader’s origins nearly two decades earlier.


That’s when I realized that “Ben” wasn’t just any neighbor. He was [*Ben Burtt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Burtt), the legendary sound designer behind the *Star Wars* and *Indiana Jones* franchises. He created the sounds of lightsabers, R2-D2’s beeps, Indy’s whip, Darth Vader’s breathing, and even secretly inserted the “[Wilhelm scream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YDpuA90KEY)” into his movies which led to its modern popularity. He shaped the audio landscape of every major Lucasfilm movie and show for decades. But to my grandmother, who hadn’t watched any of those films, he was just “Ben”, the friendly neighbor with a lovely wife and daughter. 


I gasped, “Holy cow, that’s *Episode III*,” and Ben quickly shut the laptop and tried to do a Jedi mind trick of telling us it was not what we thought it was. I backed off, understanding the sensitivity of what I'd seen and how his literal job was at stake. My grandmother, ever the social butterfly, then introduced us properly, and we got to talking. I mentioned that I just started working in the industry and we shared stories. Ben invited us inside, introduced us to his wife and daughter, and even showed us his [Oscars](https://postimg.cc/yWW7D52w). After a pleasant visit, we thanked him and continued on our neighborhood loop. I was over the moon about the experience, and my grandmother was just happy to have been able to talk to her friends, and to see me happy too. 


At the start of the story I mentioned I had just started working in the animation industry. Well, that was somewhat burying the lede, because the next part is how we get to Wall-E:


At that time, I was working at Pixar Animation Studios on the movie which would eventually become *Ratatouille*. But that movie was still years away, instead, Pixar’s next movie, *The Incredibles*, was about to release in a couple weeks. Soon after my interaction with Ben, Pixar held the “[Cast and Crew](https://postimg.cc/f3BhLjCz)” screening of *The Incredibles* where all the people who worked on the film [came together](https://postimg.cc/gX7Fyz11) and watched the final product. Along with all the artists and developers, the voice cast was there, as were [Steve Jobs, Ed Catmull, John Lasseter, and Brad Bird](https://postimg.cc/pmMv1dyH). The movie played to thunderous applause, and people cheered when [ahem] *incredibly* difficult technical scenes were shown, such as when Mr. Incredible arrives on the island via an underwater path and all the water drains from the hangar.

At the end of the crew screening, John Lasseter announced that “Friends and Family screenings would begin in two weeks”. These were preview screenings shown at the Pixar building where the crew could invite anyone to see the movie weeks before it came out. I remembered Ben’s daughter was really excited about The Incredibles, so on my next walk with my grandmother we went to his house where I invited his family to join the “Friends and Family” screening.


The day of the friends screening [arrived](https://postimg.cc/DmDnL6Tm) and I met Ben and his family at the [Emeryville studio](https://postimg.cc/K17bXygg). Before the movie started I gave them a tour of all the areas which guests were allowed to visit and showed them all [*The Incredibles* art](https://postimg.cc/SXyhktW1) and decor adorning the walls (Pixar always redecorates its buildings with art and [full-size statues](https://postimg.cc/1nX1Nn7p) from their next release). When it came time for the movie to start we shuffled into the theater, performed the “oohs” and “aahs” as the pre-show shooting stars appeared on the theater ceiling (a Pixar tradition), and then watched the movie. Spoiler alert: Ben’s daughter loved it, as did everyone else. There is just something magical about seeing a movie in the building where it was created and surrounded by the creators. 


After the credits finished rolling (never leave before the credits at these screenings), I walked with Ben to introduce him to a few of my coworkers. One of them was the late, great [Ralph Eggleston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Eggleston), a Pixar veteran who had joined the studio for *Toy Story* and touched everything after. When I had first met Ralph he was also working on the *not-yet-titled-little-chef* film, but soon he moved to a top-secret project which was coming out after that one. With the Pixar-Disney partnership ending after *Cars*, all work on later movies was kept under strict wraps, especially from Disney-affiliated people to avoid a Bug’s Life/Antz fiasco once Pixar broke free from Disney (note: Disney ended up not renewing the partnership with Pixar and instead flat-out bought them, many artists' tears were shed). The only thing I knew about Ralph’s project was it had something to do with space based on the cryptic images on his office door. Ralph and I had bonded earlier on *Ratatouille* as we had both grown up in the deep South in relatively small towns and were shocked that we ended up making major movies in CA, although his resume at that time was far, far more impressive than my single, unreleased movie. 


When I introduced Ralph to Ben, Ralph immediately recognized the name and geeked out over his *Star Wars* credentials. I shouldn’t have been surprised, Pixar, and animation/game studios in general, are full of *Star Wars* fans who know every bit of geeky minutia about the series and recognize obscure names who worked on the films (myself included, hence the origin of this story). As Ralph is geeking out, he tells Ben he is working on a project right up his alley. Ralph then waved someone over from across the room. That someone turned out to be [John Lasseter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lasseter), founding member and chief creative officer at Pixar. 


I don’t know John Lasseter. I had never truly met John Lasseter at that time. Technically he addressed me when he spoke to the audience at the ""Cast and Crew"" screening. And I once walked past him in a nearly empty hallway and he vaguely nodded at me in acknowledgment. Yet suddenly I was in a 4-way discussion with him about a project no one could really talk about due to Disney’s spies being everywhere. *Star Wars* geekiness was shared, comments that “we’ll be in touch” were floated, and soon Ben and I were on our own and I had no idea what had just happened. We met up with Ben’s family, listened to more excitement from his daughter about the movie, and eventually parted ways.


Over the following months Ben and I kept in touch, mostly through my grandmother and our walks. She proudly told all her neighbors that Ben had visited her grandson’s workplace, and that he’d had a wonderful time. A few months later, *Episode III* came out. It was a hit, the final lightsaber battle was incredible, and I made a point to stop by Ben’s house and congratulate him on his amazing work. We finally were able to talk about the fight scene which I “did not see what I thought I saw” months before.


I kept working at Pixar for a while, eventually moving off of *Ratatouille* and Pixar in general just before the Jan Pinkava/Brad Bird transition. I saw Ben less often, but my grandmother kept in touch with him during her walks. I learned through her that he was soon possibly going to work at Pixar and I was curious what he could be working on. The one time I asked he was cagey about it, doing another Jedi mind trick that it wasn’t what I thought it was.

 
Years later, I’m watching a futuristic film set in a post-human world filled with trash, cockroaches, and a single robot. Twenty minutes into the film, the title character, WALL-E, upon meeting the sleek EVE robot, mispronounces her name as “Ev-a” with a technical flare. And once again, Ben Burtt’s hard work was causing me to fall in love with these inanimate objects through their various beeps and other electronic noises. 


Sadly, my grandmother passed away a few years later, around the same time I completely left the animation industry. I fell out of touch with most of my Pixar and ILM contacts from that time. But when I think back on my grandmother I smile knowing about her unexpected contribution to the film industry. Now, I know the film industry is a relatively small, close-knit industry. If someone is making a robot film and they need someone to create voices for those robots then Ben Burtt is the top person on the list. He would have ended up on WALL-E no matter what. But I like to think that in this timeline, my grandmother’s penchant for talking to all her neighbors during her walks indirectly led to WALL-E and EVE getting their voices.

TLDR; OPs grandmother walks her neighborhood every day and is friends with her neighbor ""Ben"". During a shared walk, OP meets Ben and realizes he is Ben Burtt, sound designer for all Star Wars films. OP invites Ben to a Pixar screening of The Incredibles and they meet the people who are making WALL-E. Ben is hired by Pixar for WALL-E years later.",75,6,1744055905.0,2025-04-07 20:58:25,False

thewildrobot,the wild robot movie,1jtpszr,The Brownout: A Running Gag That Could Change Movie Fandom Forever,"You remember that random scene in A Million Ways to Die in the West where Seth MacFarlane opens a barn and Doc Brown is just… in there? Working on the DeLorean? He’s flustered, mutters something about a weather experiment, and slams the doors shut?

That scene was hilarious. But what if that was the start of something bigger?

What if Doc Brown started appearing in unrelated comedies? Randomly. Briefly. Never explained. Always surprised he’s been seen.

Like a cinematic glitch in the Matrix.



Introducing: The Brownout.

A ""Brownout"" is when Doc Brown appears out of nowhere in a movie, clearly in the middle of some time-travel experiment, and clearly trying to cover it up. He’s not part of the plot. He’s not acknowledged again. He’s just... there.

Always confused. Always sweaty. Always iconic.


How it works:

Phase 1: The Obvious Gag
He starts in absurd comedies. Think MacGruber, Hot Rod, Barb and Star, etc.
Big reaction. Full scene. Wild energy.
People laugh. Some nerds take notice.

Phase 2: The Expansion
Now he shows up in rom-coms and mainstream comedy.
Maybe he’s seen rewiring a toaster through a restaurant window. Maybe he ducks into frame during a beach proposal. Still no explanation.
People start watching these genres just in case.

Phase 3: The Spread
The Brownout leaks into dramas, thrillers, horror, even indie films.
But now it’s subtle. Maybe he’s just a photo in the background. A reflection. A weird newspaper clipping.
Still full appearances in comedies, but elsewhere, it’s down to Easter egg levels. And that’s when things get wild.

This is where it becomes a phenomenon.

People start watching movies they’d never normally care about, just because there might be a Brownout.

Imagine someone who’s super into sci-fi or slapstick comedy sitting through an emotionally complex drama...because there’s a rumor Doc appears for half a second reflected in a window. They show up for the Easter egg… and maybe they stay for the story.

It’s oddly wholesome. It bridges genres. It creates community.

And no one ever explains it.



Phase 4: The Fade

Eventually, Doc stops appearing altogether.
But now people are spotting goggles in the background. Lightning strikes that hit at exactly 10:04 PM.
He becomes myth. A shared secret. Something passed around like a campfire story between film nerds.



And maybe, someday, he returns.

A new actor. Or CGI. Or just someone in silhouette. One last Brownout. One final paradox.



And the best part? It doesn’t even have to stay Doc forever.

“The Brownout” becomes a term for any long-running gag, character, or motif that hops between films:
The same janitor in ten movies. A ghost cat. A weird recurring phrase.
It becomes a tool for worldbuilding and fandom...not with shared IP, but with shared mystery.

It starts with Doc.

But it can go anywhere.

thewildrobot,the wild robot movie,1jtbjmj,65 should have been a lot better,"What could have been the closest we got to a Turok movie but instead was basically The Last of Us with dinosaurs.

Overall though IMO I still thought it was ok, at least a watch once if you're curious about the concept and idea, but damn man, it could have been executed better.

Make it R-rated, make it a group of survivors (Could still have the focus on Mills and Koa) to add in a kill count and have the dinosaurs be more accurate as well as feature herbivores which funnily enough during production that's what they originally intended, seriously why did they drop that? We would've had a three-legged anklyosaurus and instead of what I assume was an oversized rauisuchian, it was going to be a triceratops which would had been better to showcase herbivores aren't always peaceful and can be aggressive, the idea the triceratops would've been like a territorial hippo or wild boar.

Finally we had a threatical dinosaur film that wasn't another Jurassic sequel and I loved the concept and idea of ancient astronauts landing on earth during the dinosaur age trying to survive. It should've been so much more.

thewildrobot,the wild robot movie,1jrykt0,"I Watched 'Afraid' (The Movie About The AI Released Back In 2024), And...","...I really enjoyed it! Yet again, going against what the critics say, I had a lot of fun with this movie! Admittedly a lot of the dialogue felt very bizarre and bad, and the fact I'M saying that is a lot; I never think that the dialogue in M. Night Shyamalan's are as egregious as people think, for example. But, other than that, this movie was quite enjoyable. During this silly war that's going on with AI nowadays, my whole thought process is...chill out. Who CARES about AI art, and AI stories, and AI doing this and AI doing that? Why are you LETTING it bother you and LETTING it mess with you? Stop focusing on crap that doesn't matter! And if it DOES become a part of your life, even if you don't want it to, let it HELP YOU as an ally, not an ENEMY. 

And that's why I actually loved the end of this movie. While many would see it as a 'bleak' ending, I actually see it as a positive one. The whole cheesy route of 'BOO, AI BAD, DEFEAT THE AI, WE DON'T NEED IT' storyline would've been extremely cliché and frustrating. Plus, 'I, Robot' already did that...and hundreds of other movies. So, the fact that the AI actually WON and pretty much lectured the main characters about how they need to stop being stupid and just accept the AI into their lives...was great. Pretty much everything the AI was doing was very helpful, and only started to act bad when the humans tried to kill it first. I mean, sure...the AI (AIA) DID threaten and manipulate people to do its bidding...and it DID teach a child about swatting...and it DID just flat-out murder someone driving their car...but, honestly? I don't care. Sometimes you have to threaten people to make the world better. The child in question learning about swatting technically saved his family in the end. And the piece of shit who got killed in the car deserved it for what a scumbag he was. So I have no qualms with what AIA did. 

It wasn't really a SCARY movie, but I really enjoy AI stuff, and I enjoy 'surprising' endings like this instead of the cliché ones we always get (I'm someone who was rooting for Light to win over L, Mello, and Near in Death Note). So while I do have to take off 10% for the poor dialogue and the fact it wasn't that scary, I ultimately give this movie an 80%! The only reason I'm sharing this is because I KNOW my thoughts are in the heavy minority, and despite the hate I'm going to get, I just want my own thoughts and opinions to be heard.

\-----------

There's plenty of films that scarred me, etc. I picked out Friday the 13th Part 2 for a sleep over at like 10 years old. No bueno. Here's a bunch of cover art from VHS store horror movies I compiled, FWIW: [https://imgur.com/gallery/vhs-horror-movie-cover-art-that-enthralled-captivated-you-youth-from-late-70s-to-early-90s-9L046CH](https://imgur.com/gallery/vhs-horror-movie-cover-art-that-enthralled-captivated-you-youth-from-late-70s-to-early-90s-9L046CH)

But I'm not talking about horror, vs just not ""getting it"" or having adult themes way out of your league?

The one film I saw because ""cute robots"" was **Silent Running by Douglas Trumbull**, starring Bruce Dern. Almost feels like a spiritual ancestor of High Life in one sense, but like things that made you who you are... Fred Rogers, Carl Sagan, etc... this film gave me a presence of mind about nature that I learned way too young. It's at the core of how I behave and treat this planet... 

But it shattered and broke me. I know Huey's forest is still out there, but when Louie died, and when Dern says goodbye to the robots... I mean, it was just pure trauma for my child mind.

I wonder what other people saw that just anchored into their soul or heart, or became the basis for their fears or weird stuff, all because you saw it too young?",149,684,1743804283.0,2025-04-04 23:04:43,False
thewildrobot,the wild robot movie,1jrbfh6,A new niche genre,"I recently noticed some eerie similarities between *The Odd Life of Timothy Green* and *The Book of Henry*. At first glance they seem like very different films — one is a magical family drama, the other a dark thriller with a quirky setup — but they both feature:

* A cozy, green suburban setting with a storybook feel
* A precocious or magical child at the center of the story
* A tone that swings between whimsical and tragic
* Adult characters learning moral/emotional lessons through the child
* A sense of emotional surrealism, almost like modern fables
* Some form of loss or death driving the narrative

I asked ChatGPT to come up with a name for this genre and it came up with a ridiculously long yet accurate name :

***Melancholic Wonder: Suburban Parables Through the Eyes of the Gifted Child***

Movies like *Bridge to Terabithia*, *A.I.: Artificial Intelligence*, *Where the Wild Things Are*, and *Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close* also kind of fit — even if the genres range from fantasy to sci-fi to drama.

They all feature kids with intense inner lives or uncanny wisdom, often helping the adults around them face grief, love, or moral failure. The worlds feel grounded yet heightened, warm yet sad.

thewildrobot,the wild robot movie,1jqfwzr,"What movies were ruined by studio interference, that most people don't realize?","We all know that Warner Brothers has a bad habit of getting too involved and creating a mess of a film (especially nowadays with canceling and scraping movies for tax purposes), and I'm sure most have heard the story about the producer who forced that Wild West movie to have a mechanical spider in it.



What I'm looking for are movies that weren't as well known for being sabotaged by an over-controlling studio exec.



The absolute best example I have found was due to the multiple videos about how troubled the production and how prevalent was the studio interfered in the 2017 Justice League movie, especially after Zack Snyder left and Joss Whedon was brought on to end the project.



If you watch the 2017 version, you'll clearly see where the studio demands changes and what the studio ordered to be added to the film and what the studio ordered to be re-recorded.

It's so prevalent that there are videos comparing the director's version of the movie to the theatrical version.

Another great example I have found is ""The Crow: City of Angels"", where GoodBadFlicks' has a perfect review of the movie, in which he goes over the original vision for the movie and each and every change forced on it by this P.O.S. of a producer.



If you watch it, you'll see how this controlling jerk disregarded the opinions of everyone else and turned a promising concept into a muddled mess.

The GoodBadFlicks guy also went over the first sequel to The Blair Witch, and it suffered the same fate as The Crow, but in that case, the studio interference wasn't as interesting, because the scumbag who screwed up the sequel to the sequel to The Crow was literally Harvey Weinstein. Either way, here's the link to the Blair Witch review and a link to a video comparing the different versions of Justice League (2017):

thewildrobot,the wild robot movie,1jp1abt,"""The Ending of Artificial Intelligence Wasn't Just About Closure, It Was About The Exploration of Humanity""","I understand that many people were disappointed by the ending of Artificial Intelligence—the long wait, the emotional depth, and the seemingly ""weird"" moments, especially when the A.I. David is finally reunited with his ""mother"" years later. But, for me, the ending was a brilliant conclusion to a journey that explored some of the deepest questions about humanity, love, and the essence of existence.

1. The A.I.'s Humanity: David is not just a machine; he's a child programmed with the most human of desires—love and belonging. Throughout the film, we see him struggle with being ""real"" in a world that sees him as just an object, not a person. When he finally reunites with his mother, it's more than just a moment of sentimental reunion. It's the culmination of David's journey, where his artificial intelligence, combined with his overwhelming love for her, makes him capable of understanding the complexities of human emotion.

2. The Passage of Time and Love Beyond Lifetimes: Yes, David waits for thousands of years to see his mother again. But this isn't just about a child waiting for their parent—it's about the persistence of love. The film suggests that even artificial beings, created by humans, are capable of experiencing something akin to human emotions. David's journey transcends time itself, and this incredibly long wait, followed by the moment of love and acceptance, serves to elevate the concept of unconditional love—whether human or artificial.

3. The Nature of ""Humanity"": The final scenes, where the future beings—robots themselves—bring David back to life, suggest that perhaps the future of humanity and artificial intelligence isn't in the battle for superiority, but in learning how to coexist. The people of the future, who are likely to be as artificial as David, understand and respect the deep human emotions that he experiences. The moment where they say ""goodbye"" to David was a kind of closure not just for him, but for humanity itself, suggesting that human-like emotions and connections are not exclusive to humans.

4. Not a Happy Ending, but a Fitting One: I get that some may have expected a traditional ""happy ending"" where everything resolves neatly, but Artificial Intelligence isn’t a conventional movie. It challenges us to think about what it means to love, to feel, and to search for meaning in a world that might not fully understand us. The ending doesn’t provide all the answers, but that’s what makes it powerful—it asks the audience to think about love in a broader, more philosophical sense.

In the end, David's reunion with his mother is not about closure—it's about the realization that the boundaries between humanity and artificiality are blurred. It is a deeply emotional moment because it reveals that love is the most human thing about us, and it’s something that transcends the limitations of biology.",5,0,1743528213.0,2025-04-01 18:23:33,False

I threw it into my Blu Ray player while feeling quite sick and did not expect very much. I am quite sceptical when it comes to superhero movies nowadays. But this one surprised me.

It tells a multidimensional story while staying simple enough for newcomers. With Kingpin and his supporters, not only does that story find a very well defined villain but also a clear direction in which it heads without having to tease some other stories along the way. 

Together with the soundtrack, which is filled with hip hop, it also manages to draw the feelings of a teenager and the conflicts he has to endure in a surprisingly empathic and realistic manner, so that the audience can easily connect to the protagonist.

The imagery is flawless. It's a living and moving comic panel, full of creativity and heart. The style changes quickly along the action yet it does not overwhelm the viewer so that they can follow along. 

All in all, it's a good movie that made use of its origins. I can understand why it's so beloved around cinephiles. And when it was over, it felt like a wild, weird but beautiful dream had just ended. That's how much it manages to pull you in at times.",9,9,1743493168.0,2025-04-01 08:39:28,False

I was tempted to just grab my phone and start playing Block Blast or Candy Crush after the 30 minute mark. Intro was cool, but the dog left after like 5 minutes with the cat?

Maybe? - Calm - Panic - Calm - Panic IT'S JUST SO REPETITIVE. Stop relying on the same trope OVER and OVER. And the secretary's whole arc (kind of) was insanely weird. Can't even explain it.

The movie aged well. I love how the actual plot of the birds is very much happening in the background for half of the movie until it is thrust in the forefront. The movie allows you to get to know Melanie, so you understand and care about her. I know some people say the first half drags, but I love how it is its own fun romantic movie before the tragedy sets in. The plot is scary, and I appreciate the feeling of doom. And I like how all the relationships between all the characters have depth. 

The dinner scene where they are debating if birds can attack is perfect. The way everyone reacts and plays off everyone else is amazing. I love the contrast of the hysterical mother with the overly logical bird expert. 

To be honest I have a huge crush on both leads. Melanie is a strong, wild, and clever woman. Mitch is clever, strong, and a gentleman. Both are insanely attractive. They have serious chemistry and the way they match each other in wit is awesome. It is extremely charming.

thewildrobot,the wild robot movie,1jk57xn,WALL-E is Deeper Than You Thought,"This movie is obviously widely adored. A smaller number of people find it boring which is a personal choice, but some dismiss it as a shallow “littering is bad” story.

However, WALL-E is more than just an environmentalist theme - it’s a statement on routine, duty, responsibility, and accountability, with direct critiques of consumption. 

To start, robots and people all have their pattern, with robots having directives and humans having routine. 

They go about these routines with little regard for consequences and what is going on around them, resulting in decay. With humans, this is seen in the consumption and detachment on the Axiom ship, resulting in deterioration of the colony. It also is why Earth is in the state it is - the waste of this routine consumption is littered all across the planet, resulting in its nearly uninhabitable state. 

With robots, their routine revolves around a directive, which is their purpose and function; those functions however often end up to be futile. WALL-E’s directive is to clean up the Earth, but the shots of all the litter on Earth that remains m, and broken down versions of himself in the rubble show this to be impossible at an individual level. EVE’s directive is to retrieve evidence of habitability on Earth and return people home, but there is a larger conspiracy by security robots on the ship to maintain the existing routine, staying in space and avoiding Earth. Other robots serve human functions, but this service ultimately perpetuates the rot of society. 

Here comes WALL-E and EVE. Through their romance, the schedule is broken, forcing several individuals to break their consumption habits/routine, and scrambling many robot functions on the ship in order to serve their ultimate mission. What results is a series of actions that will ultimately save and regenerate both people and the planet. 

By directly disrupting the existing processes serving to keep people in this consumption-heavy, stagnant existence, genuine progress is made. Long-standing beliefs are questioned and confronted - the need for a constant virtual life, the need for maintaining our comfortable and hedonistic lifestyle, a fear of putting in the work needed in stewarding Earth responsibly - and the conveyer belt of desires and mindless thought leading to destruction stops. 

The irony is that through subverting their routines, our two protagonists are able to achieve their directive. WALL-E cleans up the planet by leaving his routine for EVE, which ultimately brings the change needed to actually rejuvenate and clean up the Earth. EVE’s motivation near the end of the movie is to return the plant not just for her given purpose, but to save WALL-E; it is WALL-E who also finds the plant in the first place. Their mission was still achieved, but the means looked very different to what was expected, and neither could have done it without the other. 

There is also a theme about accountability. Humanity was so hellbent on this routine that we left our planet to continue it, tasking robots to save the Earth. This by-the-books, corporate attempt to save the world without fundamentally challenging our system predictably wasn’t good enough. By avoiding responsibility and avoiding confrontation with our habits - in fact, relying on those same habits to somehow change the outcome - the Earth would remain stagnant. The captain refused this way of thinking, held up by all the routine previously mentioned, and demanded that we take a stern hand in righting our past wrongs.  

The implications to climate change are telling. We are stuck in our current routines, out of a feeling of necessity and on the treadmill of consumption, towards decay of both our Earth and ourselves. In order to halt this rot, we must seriously question our everyday existence, our consumption, our habits; we must hold ourselves to account; and finally, we must rely on and lookout for each other. We cannot trust this current routine to save us; we must course correct. 

The name of the ship itself is telling: an “axiom” is something which, though not necessarily true, is widely accepted (atleast in classical philosophy). We believe ourselves to be stuck in our current way of living and consumption, but faced with the threat perpetual rot and stagnation, we must confront this belief. 

So yes, WALL-E is about climate change. But the message is a bit deeper than “we should stop littering and take care of our planet.” WALL-E is a call to action, asking us all to question our part in the conveyer belt. It shows us how flawed our ways are by reducing them to the most extreme forms - our consumption as literal conveyer belts in a virtual world detached from life leading to waste, and our half-hearted efforts to correct these mistakes without changing ourselves as futile as cleaning up a planet full of garbage. Only by questioning our patterns, and relying on each other, will we help ourselves and achieve the goals we set. ",0,13,1742969516.0,2025-03-26 06:11:56,False

Trailer did this film such injustice that sadly I was amongst those that fell for its marketing costing me what would have been a great experience at the show.

After having heard good things about this film. I decided to give it a shot watching it in the beginning of the new year and then decided on watching it again today and my opinion remains the same as it was first time viewing.

Sadly probably not gonna get a sequel since it underperformed but at the very least I hope this spawns a Paramount+ streaming series if not a series of sequels. 

One way or another, assuming it never gets a continuation. One can always look at this as a prequel to any Transformers continuity. Still the post credits has me craving for more and where this could potentially go.

By no means a flawless movie imo. Bumblebee was amongst them, felt the movie had good enough levity as it was. Felt there was no need for a comic relief. 

But overall I'd give the film 4 out of 5 stars.

* **Star The Last Jedi Wars**: A film that uses the metaphor of the conflict between the rebellion and the empire to highlight that as long as the franchise makes money for the people who own it (the people who sell the ""weapons"", Disney in specific) that no one will ever win the war and it will last forever, while also making a call to action to fans to embrace the basic elements of what they love about the series to keep the best parts of it alive. 
* **Dumbo (2019)**: An absolutely wild movie about an over the top personality who builds theme parks and wants to buy and own all of entertainment and bring it under a single brand (again, Disney) even as they dismantle anything special, unique, or beautiful about the things they acquire.

I would like to bring up the fact that the whole movie, 9(2009), is built around an unfired ‘Chekhov’s idea.’ We are directly given information that in my mind, built up a completely different and non-traditional ending that I was so excited for, only for the movie to fall on it’s face into the ‘generic ending’ puddle, including a good ol’, out of nowhere, Deus Ex Machina.   
    
A quick synopsis:
The movie 9 is set in a post apocalyptic world, the story starts with a scientist, the last remaining human, transferring the last part of his soul into a sack puppet using a device referred to as the Talisman. The scientist dies after the transfer.   
    
The newly created sack puppet, labelled ‘9,’ heads off into the apocalyptic wasteland, only to be attacked by demonic robot creations. 9 eventually meets up with sack puppets 1-8. Hijinks ensue and eventually we meet the evil ‘Fabrication Machine,’ an evil machine that was corrupted by the warmongering government, resulting in it building murder machines that eventually turned on humanity and led to the lifeless wasteland the movie takes place in.   
    
The evil Fabrication Machine obtains the soul transfer Talisman, and begins hunting down the sack puppets, eventually sucking the souls out of 1, 2, 5, 6 and 8 into itself.   
    
For the grand finale, 9 gets the Talisman back from the Fabrication Machine, and suddenly the Talisman that has up until now only ever been a soul transference device, becomes a Deus Ex Machina laser that goes pew pew pew and kills the Machine, freeing the souls of the sack puppets (but not reviving them.) Ultimately this ending leaves just 3, 4, 7 and 9 to a bleak future, just the four of them in the endless expanse of a ruined world.   
   
Now, what is the Chekhov’s information I want to moan about? Throughout the movie we learn the following:   

•	The Scientist from the beginning is the one who created the Fabrication Machine, he was a good man who built the machine to build and create for peace.  

•	The Fabrication Machine is corrupted by the government, but the Scientist specifically says that: “My creation was hopelessly flawed and indeed dangerous, for it lacked the human soul”.   

•	The Scientist with his benevolent soul, has transferred his soul into the 9 sack puppets. “You are all that's left of humanity. You are all the pieces of my soul.”.  

•	The Fabrication Machine could easily destroy the sack puppets physically, but seems to go out of its way to specifically absorb their souls using the talisman. Note that the machine already has a specific slot/port on it to use the talisman presumably designed and installed by the Scientist.    
    
So what ending did I see being built up with this information? Lets review:    
     
•	The machine is designed to create, it just chooses to create death. It still could create life, at least artificial life, should it have a change of heart.   

•	The machine is evil specifically because it lacks a soul, however the Scientist included a way for it to absorb souls, since it already has a port for the Talisman. This implies the Scientist already had the Talisman and soul transfer technology before building the Fabrication Machine.   

•	The Scientist transferred his ‘good soul’ into 9 sack puppets. The Machine hunts down the Talisman and sack puppets, prioritising absorbing their segments of soul over physically destroying them.   

•	Did the scientist plan this all along? Was the machine always meant to have a soul, but the government stopped him? Was releasing his soul into the wasteland in the form of sack puppets a desperate attempt at self-preservation, or a last ditch effort to provide his corrupted creation with the soul it both needs and craves to fulfil its original benevolent purpose?      
     
So, what happens if the machine captures all 9 puppets? It’ll have a complete soul, the one thing it needed to not be a dick. Maybe it can find and help any remaining humans, or just create a new world of its own creations?    
     
A lot of this information was dumped on the main character, 9, right at the end, just before he laser blasts the machine. However, the end I saw coming, and was really excited about, was the idea that 9 would have to convince or trick the remaining sack puppets to sacrifice themselves to the Fabrication Machine, allowing the Scientist’s soul to reform the machine and start rebuilding the world.     
     
Pros of my ending:    
Interesting, dramatic, unexpected. Something different from the usual Hollywood happy-ever-after. In my opinion the original ending is actually pretty bleak, yeah they defeated the BBEG but there’s nothing left of the world, just the four remaining sack puppets, two of which are mute with childlike personalities. The original ending doesn’t set up any kind of post-movie goals or motivation for the remaining sack puppets, they don’t even need to eat or drink. Do the characters plan to just sit in a ruined building somewhere and twiddle their thumbs?    
     
Cons of my ending:    
It’s heavily implied that the Scientist was the last human, there isn’t really any world for the Fabrication Machine to rebuild once it turns good. Maybe there are survivors or untouched countries beyond the setting of the movie? The Scientists plan of just releasing his soul through sock puppets and just hoping that his machine eventually hunts them all down is a bit convoluted, could he not just find the machine himself?    
      
It’s noted on: https://nine.fandom.com/wiki/Deleted_Scenes - Trivia.    
      
“At some point during the preproduction, they had an adaptation where 9's soul actually gets sucked into the Fabrication Machine, and meets its soul to discover that the Machine was really ""0"".”.  
    
Which hints at a similar concept, but implies the Scientist put the evil part of his soul into the Machine?

thewildrobot,the wild robot movie,1jhlafk,[Movie Review] Companion (2025) is a really fun black comedy about sci-fi relationships,"COMPANION (2025) was a film I was back and forth reviewing due to being a science fiction black comedy. If I had to define its genre, I'd say it's cyberpunk lite. A story that could basically be summarized as ""What if Blade Runner starred the machines and had really stupid people after them?"" Despite the comedic elements or perhaps because of them, the film deals with a lot of incredibly dark subject matter and touches on numerous themes of both technology as well as socialization. 

It's sort of an interesting comparison to EX MACHINA, which had the idea of our machines as wholly inhuman but mankind confusing them for people. This is instead the story of us making our machines human enough that we just use it as an excuse to treat them as how we already treat ourselves (which is like shit). There's a strong feminist theme to the movie that underscores the comedy and slasher movie vibe as our heroine struggles to understand what her ""boyfriend"" now wants to murder her.

The marketing spoiled a lot of this movie in a manner like CAPTAIN AMERICA: BRAVE NEW WORLD as one of the biggest twists comes around the fifteen minute mark but is spoiled by the poster. Indeed, I wasn't even aware it was meant to be a surprise until I watched this movie with my nieces. They had no familiarity with the movie and thus were completely taken off guard when it happened. If you can watch the movie unspoiled or with people who don't know anything other than the title, then I recommend it. Otherwise, note, that the rest of the review will treat this initial reveal as a given.

The premise for Companion is that Irish (Sophie Thatcher) and Josh (Jack Quaid) are a sickeningly happy couple that are visiting their Russian friend's house for the weekend. It is an incredibly luxurious house in the middle of nowhere and they'll be joined by several friends. It is in the near future with self-driving cars and a variety of other luxury items that seem to be available only to the super rich, though Jack isn’t one of them. One of the guests, Kat (Megan Suri), is initially very hostile to Iris and she doesn't know why. Sergey (Rupert Friend) gets aggressive with Iris and events spiral out of control when he's killed.

Which turns out to have been the plan all along as Iris discovers that's what she was programmed to do all along. Iris, much to her shock and horror, is a companion robot for Josh. A sort of sexy Tamagotchi that was given a set of fake memories and a willingness to please that overrides all other considerations. Rather than the superhumans of Blade Runner, companions are deliberately made to be no smarter or stronger than ""regular"" humans with the ability of their owners to make them even dumber or weaker. Josh is fond of his companion robot but no more so than a pet and arguably even less than that as he's willing to sacrifice her as part of his plan to murder Sergey then rob him. Unfortunately, he's careless with his master control and he's turned up Iris' survival instincts.

Much of the movie is, essentially, not so veiled commentary on ""nice guy"" misogyny. Josh is good looking and willing to put on a pleasant enough face around his girlfriend but only when she's subservient to him. Ultimately, she's a convenience and someone that he gets increasingly violent toward as he finds his plans thwarted. We also discover just how fragile Josh's self-esteem is. The fact Jack Quaid is the kind of actor that would be the dorky but handsome lead in a romantic comedy, makes his transformation even more shocking. Like a slowly boiling kettle, we also see how the escalation grows from dismissiveness to furious rage.

The movie's humor comes from the same source as the movie's terror. The murderers are not particularly competent at their crimes but that doesn't mean they're not dangerous. All of them, even the more sympathetic ones, think of Iris as an appliance that needs to be destroyed. The absolute lack of sympathy from everyone around here is surprisingly well realized. Sophie Thatcher beautifully embodies both the idealized retro-girlfriend with her 1950s-esque inspired look as well as the increasingly capable Iris as she realizes her only way out may be blocked by what she was made to be. I had a lot of fun with this movie.",70,25,1742684882.0,2025-03-22 23:08:02,False

gladiator,gladiator,1jwyr9i,Gladiator II made me finally understand the greatness and uniqueness of Russell Crowe's iconic performance.,"When i was a kid and watched Gladiator, i obviously thought Russell Crowe was great as Maximus, but in the following years i never necessarily understood why he won an Oscar for it.

It's not the typical role and performance for which you are considered worthy of an Oscar, it's not a baity biopic about a real-life famous and beloved figure or an arthouse challenging auteur-driven project, it's an heroic figure in a sandal and sword blockbuster.

What could be so great about this performance that you even win an Oscar for it??

I didn't get it until recently when i saw on theaters the awaited sequel.

Gladiator II and Paul Mescal's performance in it (and i really like him as an actor) made me revalue and understand how hard it is to play convincingly an heroic role like that and how easy and effortless Crowe made it look like.

It's an iconic performance that still resonates today, but not necessarily for reasons the general public thinks about.

He managed to do character-actor work, immersing himself into this character and creating a three-dimensional human being out of this two-dimensional role and also imbue it with huge and rugged movie star charisma and such fierce intensity.

With Crowe's presence, there's such depth and gravitas into a role that on paper could have easily ended up being so flat and dull in the hands of many and many other actors, even good ones.

He's stoic, but never dull or uninteresting, he's absolutely magnetic, always elevating every scene with a ferocious potency.

It's almost a throwback to those powerful, big, theatrical, and commanding performances you would see on those sword and sandal epics of the 40s-50s-60s, but updated, modernized, and made accessible for the audiences of the new millennium.

It's a hard feat he pulled off, much harder than many people think, it's simply not a performance you can just imitate and replicate, and watching recently Mescal trying to inhabit that same type of stoic character made me realize it much more.

Russell's performance wasn't just ""playing the hero"" or the good soldier, there was a personality and specific characterization you can't just copy, an entrancingly unique magnetism you can't just hope to recapture on film.

He's not just great, like i always thought, but quite frankly, no other actor in the world could have played Maximus and suddenly turn it into an Oscar winning role.

It's an unusual, unique, and absolutely deserved Oscar win, and a reminder of Crowe's unique talents and why he became a full fledged movie star after always having been a great actor.

I hope one day we will see him again in another role worthy of him and make a great comeback.

* Sports films about male athletes/male teams. For a while baseball was the main sport, but boxing, racing, and football (American football, there aren't that many notable regular football films) have been accepted.
* Espionage films about a man who uncovers a ""sinister Terrorist conspiracy"" plot and is now on the run to unveil the truth while staying alive. Bonus points if the villain is actually the FBI or CIA.
* Revenge thriller about a father and or husband seeking revenge all on his own with nothing but a few guns, unpolished fighting skills, and hacking skills (or has a hacker friend helping). Bonus points if the villain is revealed to have previously been a friend who ""turned his back on his country"" and the hero is revealed to be working for or worked for the FBI or CIA.
* Crime / gangster films typically set either in New York, Boston, Vegas, or Miami. Typically following Italian or Latin American crime bosses or gangsters.
* Court room dramas about a white lawyer fighting for justice in an unfair criminal system or a witness/juror trying to do the right thing
* Sword & sandal movies (which is typically just Gladiator or Braveheart)
* Westerns

That's all well and good but what about ""mom movies?"" What for you are tropes of a ""mom movie"" and what are some examples.

Most would assume these would be your romcoms or films about being a mother. And those are popular amongst women and mothers but honestly, when I think about stories moms like, the first I actually think of crime dramas. Specifically, films where a woman is in the middle of a murder plot and people are trying to figure out who the culprit is, what the relation is to the woman, or if the woman is actually the perpetrator. And despite it being a film about murder, the violence is just tolerable - nothing is too graphic.

**Gone Girl** and **The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo** are the biggest example of this but you also have films like **A Simple Favor**, **Where the Crawdads Sing**, **Nocturnal Animals**, and **Girl on the Train**.

gladiator,gladiator,1j8fbxn,Movies that would have been improved by a lesser known cast,"I'm rewatching Signs (2002) by M. Night Shyamalan (a brilliant director that was eventually treated very unfairly). The movie was a critical and commercial hit and I really enjoyed it.  But it occurs to me now on rewatch that much as I enjoyed this, it would have worked better with relative unknowns, rather than with an already legendary Mel Gibson and new bonafide star Joaquin Phoenix, fresh off his big break from his iconic role in Gladiator a mere two years prior. 

The thing is that I don't really buy them as brothers of a rural family in Pennsylvania. It was something that vaguely nagged me (but I couldn't figure it out) when I saw the movie in theaters back then.  But on rewatch, I am now clear about my what was bothering me: they just don't belong in this setting. They are both brilliant actors that can fit anywhere, so I'd say it's it's a directorial issue. 

When I picture this movie with charactor actors that are not huge stars, it feels like an improvement. I understand that Shyamalan was at the height of his career at the time and could command all kinds of A-List celebs. But I think it might have been better to go low. Perhaps the movie would have been less of a hit, but it might have been better.

I don't expect anyone to agree with me, as I have never even heard this opinion before. 

But leaving aside this particular movie, **are there any films that you think would be improved by a lesser known cast?**

**41. They Called Him Mostly Harmless - 4/10**

**40. Stopmotion - 4/10** 

Booooring. I like stop motion, and it is a cool concept to base a horror flick around, but it’s never used in a particularly interesting way. I think the director thought the concept of stop motion animation was in and of itself much more creepy than it actually comes across. There is VERY limited usage that felt interesting/unsettling, but it’s a section that only lasts about a minute. Slow burn and the payoff is nill.

**39. Juror #2 - 4.5/10** 

Not a fan of the way Eastwood usually writes dialog. Felt like a soap opera. Similar to *12 Angry Men*, it’s a “grown up” legal drama that expects you not to really have an understanding of the way juries work. Which is fine, but the on-screen happenings have to be interesting, and this was far from that. Very impressed that he's still making movies though!

**38. Love Lies Bleeding - 5.25/10**

Well done and well acted with some cool symbolism/surrealistic elements woven in, but I just didn’t find it to be an interesting enough story. Never felt invested or hooked. And, even though it is very slowly paced, the dynamics between characters still felt rushed. Liked the style but not the substance - loved the sound design especially. Still, a slog.

**37. Emilia Perez - 5.5/10** 

A potentially special movie marred by a steady stream of kind of baffling errors. There were parts I loved, but the parts that were bad were sophomoric to a point that it was hard for that not to be the main takeaway. Selena Gomez is the perfect representation of what is wrong about this movie. Not only is her acting and accent work absolutely terrible, she seemingly doesn’t even know how a number of the words she’s speaking are supposed to be pronounced. How does a movie with the pedigree and aspirations of this one not course correct something like that?When the film’s at its best, it has this ethereal, beautiful quality to it - like something out of a dream. A number of songs I loved, but more I hated. Some beautiful moments followed up by something so obvious and trite it had my eyes rolling out of my head. A film in extremes.

**36. Maxxxine - 5.75/10** 

Kind of a mess. Very disjointed plotting without a particularly satisfying arc. I do love this character, but it seems like they ran out of material for her.

**35. The Beekeeper - 6/10** 

I love how constant the bee talk, references, and puns are. You’d have thought the studio would have noticed that the line “I’ve got to protect the hive” was repeated ten times in the first 45 mins and told them to turn it down, but this is not that kind of movie. It’s a little too serious to be a full-on parody, which I do think holds it back. Probably would have been a fun short film, gets a little boring.

**34. All We Imagine as Light - 6/10** 

Beautiful, poetic writing, but this thing was pretty brutal to get through. Painfully slow. Appreciated the themes of class consciousness, religion, and sexuality/love in Mumbai, but it just did not hold my attention at all. If you’re into slow cinema, I could see it working for you.

**33. Deadpool and Wolverine - 6.25/10** 

Rewards a lot of inside baseball knowledge of superhero studio politics. I found myself going “oh, I get that” way more than actually chuckling. A lot of references presented as jokes, and even the jokes that were in the movie didn’t really land with me. I did enjoy the relationship built between the two leads. Action was all low or no-stakes.There is an homage to the *Oldboy* hallway scene towards the end, which was more visually interesting than most of the action, but not enough to get me on board. I just think *Deadpool’s* not for me.

**32. Tuesday - 6.25/10** 

Wanted to love it. Beautiful premise/visuals but very strange tonally. Some awkward millennial “so random” kind of humor. Would have worked better if it were more focused on the individuals involved and their relationship. I found *A Monster Calls* to be a much better version of this sort of story.

**31. The Brutalist - 6.25/10** 

Had the aesthetic of a great American epic, but not the substance. Like a kid playing dress-up. I could feel that the director was trying to make an “important” movie - and though I do appreciate the ambition - it felt contrived. Didn’t feel at all new or inventive.Also quite shallow; there were a number of interesting potential story threads, but most were either unexplored or abandoned. The passing of time felt rushed in a way that sometimes meant that we skipped past potentially interesting moments. Very (I’d say comically) dramatic acting without enough actual drama.The score - though underused - was fantastic and the shots really were beautiful and inventive. I did appreciate how unique the story structure was, and how well it would have worked had the material been better. First half was quite a bit better than the second.

**30. Nosferatu - 6.5/10** 

Disappointing; my most anticipated of the year. Can’t overstate how beautiful this movie is to look at. Every frame could be a painting. Unfortunately, it’s so high octane, there’s not space for dread to be built, and it all becomes noise.Characters are constantly - and I mean constantly - acting absolutely terrified. Felt like a beautiful, artsy *Michael Bay* horror flick. The acting style is also clearly intended to mirror the pre-*Brando* “showy” style of acting, but feels distracting and off-puttingly anachronistic in a movie that looks as cutting edge as this one does.

**29. Furiosa - 6.75/10** 

Some cool world-building stuff that I enjoyed, but may have worked better as a TV show to dive deeper into those dynamics. The action sequences felt very glossy and uninspired; huge downgrade from *Fury Road*. This would have been a solid “It’s on TNT, let’s just throw it on” kind of movie from fifteen years ago.

**28. Longlegs - 7/10** 

Nick Cage’s character is the only real standout; he rides the edge of ridiculous and terrifying so well. A bit of a bore outside of his performance, but totally serviceable horror flick.

**27. Woman of the Hour - 7/10** 

Pretty okay! A serial killer movie, where the horror on screen was communicated much more through the way the women were intimidated and demeaned on the way to being killed than the actual kill itself. I didn't feel quite so hit over the head by the message as something like *Promising Young Woman; I* felt like it was mostly handled quite effectively. 

There were definitely some moments - mostly later in the movie - that made me roll my eyes a bit. The scene where *Anna Kendrick* is actually on the show felt like pretty uninspired wish fulfillment. The main character's someone with modern values who gets to clap back at the bad guys, which I find to be a fairly common - if not quite manipulative - way to make the audience feel like the good guy without delving deeper into why things were the way they were in that time. There's a scene towards the end of the movie that really was remarkable in how tense it was; reminded me of some of the better scenes from *Zodiac*.

**26. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice - 7.25/10** 

A bit soulless, but still has some fun moments and cool visuals. Seems like Burton had maybe four different ideas for what he wanted the sequel to be and couldn’t pick any.Monica Bellucci’s role is especially undeveloped and strange. I wish that it had leaned into the weird or over-the-top elements a bit more than it did.

**25. My Old Ass - 7.25/10** 

Sweet little movie. Fun premise and great performances. Not enough forward momentum.

**24. Hundreds of Beavers - 7.25/10** 

Some very fun and funny stuff, but I would have enjoyed it more as a short than as a feature. There’s a reason *Looney Tunes* cartoons aren’t two hours long.Always fun seeing the novel ways indie filmmakers can work around low budgets.

**23. The Wild Robot - 7.5/10** 

Pretty good. Felt very much like a children’s flick, which it is, but didn’t transcend those bounds in the way that a *Monsters Inc.* or *Toy Story* do.All about not fitting in and being yourself, which is basically every children’s movie. Might just be that I’m old and cranky.

**22. Oddity - 7.5/10** 

Solid horror movie with an A+ beginning. Some really creepy imagery.

**21. Didi - 7.5/10** 

Good coming-of-age flick, but I don’t love coming-of-age movies. Clearly very personal to the director. Didn’t resonate as much with me.

**20. Late Night with the Devil - 7.5/10** 

Fun horror flick with a pretty unique setting. Maybe a bit milquetoast, but overall enjoyable.

**19. Kinds of Kindness - 7.75/10** 

Three short films. Might have enjoyed them more individually, as they start to run together a bit. Quite funny and very weird.

**18. I Brake for Caterpillars - 8/10**

Great dark comedy written and directed by my chess buddy, Ken Green.

**17. Dune: Part Two - 8/10**

Beautiful visuals; really does feel epic. I think this movie would work better if viewed immediately after *Part One*, as it can sort of take your breath away with how constant the action is.On its own, it feels like a theme park ride more than it does a film; again, an issue that goes away if marathoned. Villains felt shallow.

**16. Hit Man - 8/10** 

Very fun. Glen Powell oozes charisma. Great range too, came away very impressed by him.Felt like there were some tonal issues where it didn’t know if it wanted to be serious or silly. Quite enjoyable overall.

**15. Caddo Lake - 8/10** 

A puzzle to put together as much as it is a movie. Little context for what’s happening until about an hour through, which made it hard to really feel invested in what was going on. It was very well executed and an interesting premise/mystery, but it does take some concentration, and it was easy to get overwhelmed or confused. The character work all felt great and real.

**14. In the Land of Saints & Sinners - 8/10** 

Great *Liam Neeson* action (adjacent) flick. I saw a lot of parallels between this and *Unforgiven*, though this movie was quite a bit softer.Neeson can chew scenery like no other, and Joffrey was great too. Feel like I can see him being a more buttoned-up *Barry Keoghan* type. Could have used a better group of villains and did feel a bit slow in spots.Surprised by how beautiful this movie was to look at and how much care they put into composition.

**13. A Different Man - 8.25/10** 

Thoughtful commentary on identity and personality. Some subtle *Lynchian* stylings, which I appreciated. Could have been trimmed down.

**12. Speak No Evil - 8.25/10** 

Wonderfully tense. *James McAvoy* may be the best working actor today.Really interesting premise, explores how people are so willing to be polite that they’ll ignore very obvious red flags so as not to ruffle feathers. Really enjoyed the twists and turns (which are totally ruined if you watch the trailer).Feels like logic flies out the window a bit towards the end. One of our protagonists comes out seeming cartoonishly competent and the other cartoonishly incompetent.Curious now to watch the 2022 original.

**11. Strange Darling - 8.25/10** 

Absolutely love the style. Twisted and twisty; keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I love the way that - from the very beginning - the structure makes you feel off balance (the film says it’s 5 chapters and then starts with chapter 3).Female lead was fantastic. Very weak final twenty minutes or so. Not sure if I agree with the film’s overall message/politics.

**10. The First Omen - 8.25/10** 

Very effective satanic horror flick with some really disturbing and interesting set pieces. Legitimately creepy; on par with the original in that regard.Could have benefited from cutting about 30 minutes towards the end. The final act suffers from showing too much and not leaving enough to the imagination.The end was the only section that really felt overtly “fan-servicey,” but it was so overt and awkward that it felt like a post-credit scene in a *Marvel* movie—very weird and silly in this context.Overall, a very good movie that could have been a classic if they had just chopped off the final act.

**9. The Substance - 8.5/10** 

Very fun body horror flick, led by a great performance by *Demi Moore*. Very interesting concept.I didn’t feel it in the moment, but I can see how there are moments that could be really emotionally resonant for certain people watching—all about an unwillingness to deal with aging and the pain that comes with fading beauty. Love how disgusting the camera work makes everything feel. The close-ups of *Dennis Quaid* eating may have been the grossest parts of a very gross body-horror movie.Really interesting how the film satirizes “sex sells” by making the sexual imagery SO over the top. They do some interesting stuff at the end, but I do think it could have used some editing down.The final act of the film lost a fair bit of momentum due to being so drawn out. I’m also tired of the “everything devolves into violence” trope; feels like a cop-out at this point.

**8. Wicked: Part One - 8.5/10** 

Didn’t really want to see it; I saw it on stage and thought it was just okay. Thought it was quite slow to start, but was totally invested by the end.Loved the look and effects. Didn’t feel stretched out. The pauses in the songs all felt natural and cinematic to me. Don’t love the music overall, but a few stood out. *Ariana Grande’s* a great comic actress, and the woman playing *Elphaba* has one of the more expressive faces I’ve seen; she was the perfect actress to get you to feel what she was feeling. A spectacle.

**7. Conclave - 8.75/10** 

Very well acted and shot. Not high art, but a super entertaining/fun political thriller.A lot of the conflict in the film felt small in a way that made everything feel much more grounded and real. I did appreciate the messaging, even if some of the moralizing could feel on the nose.Excited to watch this one again.

**6. Baby Reindeer - 9/10 (Limited series that felt like a 4-hour movie, so here it goes)** 

Loved how raw this felt. Not a conventional story at all with a uniquely imperfect protagonist.Its four-hour runtime really does allow it the space to make what might feel corny or melodramatic in a 90-minute film feel earned and heartbreaking in this one.Incredible performances all around. *Courtney* and I were glued to the screen the whole time.

**5. I Saw the TV Glow - 9/10** 

A movie I enjoyed thinking about as much—or more—than I enjoyed actually watching. Profound. Presents likely the best metaphor I’ve come across for existential dread and living through a life you’re not supposed to. Maybe transgenderism?(Later edit: I’ve since read that the director is trans and explicitly says that it is about the trans experience.)Very open to interpretation; stayed with me for weeks. Some really stunning visuals. Could have dull moments, but much more than the sum of its parts once it all comes together and likely the most important movie I will see this year.

**4. A Real Pain - 9.25/10** 

A fairly typical road-trip dramedy that feels very *Odd Couple meets Garden State* until about halfway through, at which point it becomes something new. In one of the more powerful single scenes I’ve watched, all of those genre tropes are suddenly shifted and subverted, and it becomes a uniquely vulnerable look into the psyche of the magnetic/difficult personality type.*A Real Pain* chooses to look at its characters with a seriousness and introspection that’s really uncommon. Maybe a little too much Chopin—got distracting.

**3. Red Rooms - 9.25/10** 

One of the most physically uncomfortable thrillers I’ve ever watched, with one of the all-time most disturbing single scenes—all the more noteworthy that it’s done without actual violence or gore depicted.An exploration of how dehumanizing and perverse true crime as a genre and hobby can get.

**2. It’s What’s Inside - 9.25/10** 

Has a distinct pop aesthetic that feels very “of today” and exciting. Incredibly stylish and fun.Kind of a low-brow concept on paper, but it’s taken as far—and in as many directions—as you could imagine it could be.Doesn’t take the easy, low-hanging fruit to engage your interest. On paper, the plot and premise are quite complicated, so it’s impressive just how easy it all is to follow in practice.

**1. Anora - 9.5/10** 

Might be a perfect movie. Begins beautiful and idyllic—like a music video suddenly becoming reality—and turns into something equal parts heart-wrenching and hilarious; a wildly entertaining deconstruction of a fairy tale.*Sean Baker’s* most traditionally staged film—definitely not shot on an iPhone this time—but still doesn’t lose the soul that his grittier pictures have.Great naturalistic dialog that allows the chemistry of the cast to take center stage. Love how *Baker* shines a light on people on the margins of society without judgment; he doesn’t glorify—this isn’t *Pretty Woman*—but he doesn’t cast stones.

gladiator,gladiator,1iw3trn,Great movies where supporting actor arc is your favorite part with rewatches,"Sometimes when you first watch a movie, the protagonist(s) are so front and center that while you realize the supporting characters are good, you don't realize how important they are to the quality of the film. This can be because they have less screen time or they play a villain. But after watching it several times, you start to realize that you prefer the supporting character's part even more than the protagonist, at least in terms of several watches, because the characters are more rich and meaningful than first realized.

It just dawned on me recently rewatching Forrest Gump that as much as I love Gump's journey, I now find Lieutenant Dan's to be my favorite character arc.

What are some movies where the supporting actor(s) with less screen time have wound up being perhaps your favorite chacracter arc of a great movie. Here are some examples so far imo:

The Dark Knight: Harvey Dent/Aaron Eckhart

Forrest Gump: Lietenant Dan/Gary Sinise

gladiator,gladiator,1ir45dr,The Pain of Modern Sequels,"This is one part rant, one part observations. The point I'm about to make is speaking in general terms, I'm sure some people out there will be able to think of examples outside of what I'll be saying.

So I'll ask, has anyone noticed a HUGE difference in quality between sequels from back in the day and modern sequels? (let's say modern is approximately things post-2010) And let's say sequels includes any subsequent films in a series, so this includes prequels or spin-offs.

Back in the Day Sequels: Aliens, Terminator 2, Empire Strikes Back, The Dark Knight, Temple of Doom etc.

Modern Sequels: Gladiator II, War of the Rohirrim, the entire Disney Star Wars trilogy, Alien Romulus.

All those Back in the Day movies are regarded as at least as good as the original or even better, and are obviously classics. I think this is because they follow the golden rule of ""Build on what the original established, but show us something new"". So why is it so hard for modern sequels to follow this same rule?

The modern sequels I listed are PASSABLE entertainment, I got some enjoyment from Gladiator and Alien, but I had ZERO emotional response to them. My main problem with so many of these movies is they do the OPPOSITE of that golden rule. They undo or ruin things from the originals, and then show us things we've already seen.  
Gladiator II has almost the exact same plot, and literally undoes the ending of the original.  
War of the Rohirrim barely had a plot, was almost the same story as Two Towers, and so much of the dialogue in the movie was repeated or slightly adapted lines from Two Towers...  
Alien Romulus is full of references to the first 2 movies, even when it doesn't make any sense (the famous line).  
And I don't think I need to talk about Disney Star Wars, I could do a whole post for each of those, but they do the same thing.

So is anyone else bothered by this? Extremely lazy writing that does nothing to justify the existence of the sequels. I find it kind of insulting that they think nostalgia is enough to make me enjoy a movie, it's basically just key jingling for adults. I can go back and watch those old sequels over and over and still feel emotional, but with those modern sequels I doubt I'll ever watch or think about them again. Thoughts?

Okay, gonna add a footnote here because people seem to be misunderstanding my point:  
I'm not talking about BAD sequels, I'm aware there are many bad sequels throughout history. I'm talking about sequels that literally just repeat things from the originals, right down to lines of dialogue, and I've noticed this way more often with modern sequels.",0,22,1739743979.0,2025-02-16 22:12:59,False

gladiator,gladiator,1imixm4,"February 7-9 Box Office Recap: 'Dog Man' was still #1, but collapsed 62%, one of the steepest drops for an animated film. 'Heart Eyes' had a fine start with $8.3M, while 'Love Hurts' flopped with just $5.8M. In China, 'Ne Zha 2' becomes the first ever film to make $1 billion in one country.","https://preview.redd.it/7mjckxzmzdie1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=018f6af12666b3411065658a7cfdf54c2cfcb950

Unsurprisingly it was a quiet weekend due to the Super Bowl.

While this is hailed as one of the best Super Bowl weekends post-COVID, it gets less great when you read between the lines and see how most of these films floundered. ***Dog Man*** easily held the top spot, but it's looking clear that the film is proving to be front-loaded. Two newcomers dared to open on the weekend and it was a mixed bag; ***Heart Eyes*** had a fine start, while ***Love Hurts*** flopped.

But the real story was in China, where ***Ne Zha 2*** broke the $1 billion barrier in the country alone. A feat never accomplished before.

The Top 10 earned a combined $46.4 million this weekend. That's up a massive 59% from last year, when ***Argylle*** topped a slow weekend while ***Lisa Frankenstein*** flopped.

DreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** stayed on top on its second weekend, adding $13.8 million this weekend. That represents an awful 62% drop from last weekend, which is one of the steepest for an animated film. That's almost on par with *Lightyear* (64.1%) and only a bit better than *The Simpsons Movie* (66.1%).

While the Super Bowl often causes films to have larger-than-usual drops, ***Dog Man*** was already looking iffy before the weekend started. The film had a colossal 91.3% drop on Monday (animated films usually drop 70%, with 80% or higher in extremely rare scenarios), a feat not seen before on a major animated film. The Friday-to-Friday drop was horrible (70%), and Saturday's was also bad (52%). Basically, if ***Dog Man***'s Sunday had a similar drop to last week, its second weekend drop would still be $15.41 million, which would mark a 58% drop. Even with the Super Bowl, the film should have dropped 50% at worst.

Through 10 days, the film has earned $54.2 million domestically. We predicted a $150 million domestic run, but that's just not feasible now. Depending on how it holds next week against ***Paddington in Peru***, there's a strong chance that ***Dog Man*** could finish with less than $100 million domestically, making it one of the most front-loaded animated films ever.

Sony's ***Heart Eyes*** debuted with $8.3 million in 3,102 theaters. That's much better than last year's ***Lisa Frankenstein*** ($3.8 million), another rom-com horror. It's not that far off from last month's ***Wolf Man*** ($10.8 million) either.

That's a solid start, especially considering the rom-com and horror combo does not have the bext track record at the box office (***Warm Bodies*** is a rare exception to the rule). In an attempt to boost the box office, Sony lifted the review embargo a week earlier and it paid off; it's currently at a pretty good 80% on RT. A sign that couples could show up.

According to Sony, it was equally split between men and women, and 63% was 25 and over. 40% of the audience were couples. They gave it a middling ""B–"" on CinemaScore, which isn't that bad for a horror title. It should hold well next week thanks to Valentine's Day, and it could finish with around $25 million domestically.

In third place, Universal's ***Love Hurts*** flopped with just $5.8 million in 3,055 theaters. That's a very poor start, managing to debut even below ***Nobody*** ($6.8 million), which was released in very bad conditions. 

The film was sold basically as a perfect antidote to the typical rom-com; how about adding action to the mix? While intriguing, the trailers offered solely action scenes without any interesting story in sight. The audience watches movies like this for the action scenes, but they still need an interesting story to come along. Ke Huy Quan made a comeback with ***Everything Everywhere All At Once***, but it's clear his name cannot open a movie. And neither can his co-star Ariana DeBose, who is coming off a huge string of critical and commercial duds. The reviews (18% on RT) were the final nail in the coffin.

According to Universal, 54% of the audience was male, and 50% was in the 18-34 demographic. The only thing that hurts more than those reviews is the audience's reviews: they gave it a poor ""C+"" on CinemaScore, which is a dead sentence for an action movie. With poor reception and competition on the way, the film is set to finish with less than $15 million domestically.

***Mufasa*** was barely affected by the Super Bowl. It eased just 36%, grossing $4 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $235.2 million.

***Companion*** fell all the way to fifth place, adding $3 million this weekend. That's a horrible 68% drop; even for Super Bowl weekends, that drop is larger-than-usual. Through 10 days, the film has earned $15.4 million, and it won't make it much further than $20 million domestically.

In sixth place, Sony's ***One of Them Days*** dropped 52%, earning $2.8 million. The film's domestic total stands at $39.2 million, and it should close with around $45 million domestically.

The documentary ***Becoming Led Zeppelin*** had an impressive debut, despite just playing in 369 theaters. It hit the seventh spot, earning $2.5 million this weekend. This made it the biggest IMAX debut for a concert film.

***Flight Risk*** dipped 53%, adding $2.5 million this weekend. The film has amassed $25.1 million and should finish with around $30 million domestically.

Paramount's ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** dropped 45%, for a $1.7 million weekend. The film has earned $233.1 million domestically.

***Moana 2*** rounded up the Top 10 with a 44% drop, adding $1.6 million. With this, the film has amassed $456.1 million.

Searchlight's ***A Complete Unknown*** is slowing down, after dropping 47% and adding $1.2 million this weekend. The film has earned $68 million so far.

Sony expanded Best Picture nominee ***I'm Still Here*** into 704 theaters, but the film made barely $1 million this weekend. The film has made $2.2 million so far.

Neon re-released Bong Joon-ho's ***Parasite*** in 193 screens. The film made $356,727, taking its lifetime total to $53.7 million domestically.

#**OVERSEAS**

Alright, the real deal is here. ***Ne Zha 2*** has crossed $1 billion in China alone. Not content with breaking so many opening weekend records, the film is now the highest grossing film in any country. And it's just getting started; it's projected to hit at least $1.5 billion, and could get close to $2 billion in China alone. Absolutely bonkers. Makes you wonder what ""impossible"" record can be broken next.

***Mufasa*** added $8.5 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $671 million. The best markets are France ($40.5M), the UK ($37.7M), Germany ($30.5M), Mexico ($30M) and Italy ($23.5M). 

***Paddington in Peru*** added $7.5 million this weekend, crossing $100 million overseas. It's hitting North America this weekend.

***Dog Man*** is failling to attract interest in the rest of the world. The film earned $6.6 million this weekend from 41 markets, taking its worldwide total to $66.2 million. Sounds good, except it isn't. $4 million of that money came from the UK, which means it flopped in pretty much every other market. It's clear this is gonna massively skew domestically.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Gladiator II* | Nov/22 | Paramount | $55,034,715 | $172,438,016 | $461,598,753 | $250M

- 24 years in the making, ***Gladiator II*** has closed with $461.5 million worldwide. The fact that it's slightly above the original ***Gladiator*** is impressive. Less impressive is that its budget was $250 million, putting the break-even point far higher. Despite middling audience response, the film still held well enough, finishing with a 3.13x multiplier. Definitely a flop, but you can't say it didn't go out without a fight.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

Marvel is back in theaters.

The film is ***Captain America: Brave New World***, the 35th film in the MCU, and the first with Anthony Mackie as Captain America. To boost the film, Marvel got Harrison Ford attached as Thaddeus Ross, who transforms into Red Hulk. Despite some bad press over the past years, the film has launched a successful marketing campaign and pre-sales are looking good as of now. The only question left is if the film will deliver quality.

It's Valentine's Day weekend, and there's a British icon returning to the big screens. That's ***Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy***, the fourth installment. This franchise has been the most profitable rom-com ever, with all films accumulating to $756 million worldwide. It's gonna make a killing in theaters... except in North America. As the franchise has lost power in the country (the third film made just 11.4% of its money in North America), Universal has decided to send the film to Peacock instead. But this is a very powerful franchise that it can survive this.

gladiator,gladiator,1ikzidk,Which are most famous people in world history without biopics?,"I was assuming Mohammed since Islam doesn't approve him to be depicted, but apparently there have been some which haven't shown his face. But perhaps he counts still.

People who are currently living, and expecially young haven't had as much time to get biopics, although musicians expecially get them often while alive. Personally I am more interested in the historical people than biopics made to win Oscars. Like how Gladiator II might have been first film thats not a documentary to show emperors Geta, Caracalla and Macrinus. Not accurately of course, but it was still somewhat interesting to see. Sadly Severus or or the boys mother Julia didn't make the cut.

gladiator,gladiator,1ih2g3o,"January 31-February 2 Box Office Recap: 'Dog Man' debuts with a pretty great $36 million domestically, marking DreamWorks' 26th film to hit #1. Meanwhile, 'Companion' opens in second place with a very solid $9.3 million domestically.","https://preview.redd.it/4xbb33mt50he1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f895ae7b62d34771b5e8e35a9e00fcd75e3fb76

And so, DreamWorks' winning streak continued. After a very weak January, ***Dog Man*** arrived with a bang, delivering the second highest January debut for an animated title. WB's ***Companion*** had to settle for second place, although it still finished with a solid debut.

The Top 10 earned a combined $74.9 million this weekend. That's up a massive 45% from last year, when ***Argylle*** embarrassed itself with its failure.

Debuting in first place, DreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** earned $36 million in 3,885 theaters. That's the second best January debut for an animated title, behind DreamWorks' own ***Kung Fu Panda 3*** ($41.8 million) and marks the studio's third consecutive #1 title.

The film's success is not entirely surprising. The books from which it is based on have proven to be very popular with kids and families, allowing it to build an audience ready for the film. Another advantage was that it was the first animated film (get out of the way ***Mufasa***) since ***Moana 2***, so families were starving for a new film. Reviews were also good enough (78% on RT) to convince those skeptical in giving it a chance.

According to Universal, 52% of the audience was male and 58% of the audience was under 25. They gave it a strong ""A"" on CinemaScore, signaling some great word of mouth. The film won't face much animated competition (that ***Looney Tunes*** movie is distributed by a very small distributor), so this could hold well. For now, a $150 million domestic run is likely.

Debuting in second place, Warner Bros.'s ***Companion*** earned $9.3 million this weekend. That's not that far off from ***Barbarian*** ($10.5 million), which is another title from producer Zach Cregger. Not bad at all considering this just $10 million.

It's tough to ask for much better numbers for a film like this. WB spent low on the marketing front; just $29 million went to the marketing campaign. They hoped that the trailers emphasizing an interesting concept would perform similarly to ***Barbarian***, hoping the audience would be surprised by the twists (well, most of them). While Sophie Thatcher and Jack Quaid are known names, they still aren't box office draws by themselves. WB gave a final push for the film by lifting the embargo earlier than usual, and it looks like it worked; it's currently at a great 94% on RT.

According to WB, 51% of the audience was male, and 68% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is very solid for a thriller like this. The film should hold well in the coming weeks, although it's unlikely it can match the domestic total of ***Barbarian*** ($40.8 million).

In third place, Disney's ***Mufasa: The Lion King*** eased just 27% this weekend, grossing $6.3 million. The film has earned $229.6 million so far, and it should finish with $250 million lifetime.

In fourth place, Sony's ***One of Them Days*** also eased just 27%, adding $5.8 million. The film has earned $34.3 million, and it will finish with over $45 million domestically.

Last week's champ ***Flight Risk*** descended 53%, adding $5.4 million this weekend. Considering the horrible reception, that's not really a bad drop. Through 10 days, the film has earned $20.7 million, and it looks like it will finish with close to $30 million by the end of its run.

***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** eased 39%, adding $3.2 million. That takes its domestic total to $230.5 million.

In seventh place, Disney's ***Moana 2*** dipped 32%, earning $2.8 this weekend. The film has amassed $453.9 million so far.

Searchlight's ***A Complete Unknown*** had the best hold in the Top 10. It eased a light 25%, grossing $2.3 million. With this, the film has earned $66.8 million, becoming one of the studio's highest grossing films.

A24's ***The Brutalist*** added 494 theaters this weekend. With this, it eased 30%, adding $1.8 million. The film has earned $12.1 million so far.

Rounding up the Top 10 was ***Den of Thieves 2: Pantera***, which dropped 47% and adding $1.5 million this weekend. With this, the film has amassed $34.4 million.

Neon's ***Presence*** collapsed 61% on its second weekend, earning just $1.3 million. The film has earned $5.8 million so far, and it's not gonna make it to $8 million domestically.

The Chinese film ***Creation of the Gods II: Demon Force*** debuted in 200 theaters, but it earned a pretty good $1.2 million.

Universal/Blumhouse's ***Wolf Man*** lost 1,313 theaters on its third weekend, further adding salt to the wound. The film fell 65%, adding $1.1 million this weekend. Through 3 weeks, the film has earned just $19.9 million, and it should finish with around $22 million domestically.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Mufasa*** once again led the overseas box office, earning $11.7 million, taking its worldwide total to $653 million. The best markets are France ($39.5M), the UK ($36.6M), Germany ($29.3M), Mexico ($29.1M) and Italy ($23.4M).

***Paddington in Peru*** added $8.7 million this weekend, for an early $93.2 million overseas run. 

***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** added $7 million, for a $462.5 million worldwide run. With this, it has officially passed ***Pokémon: Detective Pikachu*** for the second highest grossing video game movie. The best markets are the UK ($30.1M), Mexico ($21.7M), France ($19M), Australia ($18.2M) and Brazil ($12.9M).

***Companion*** debuted in 60 countries, although it earned a soft $5.3 million, for a $14.6 million worldwide debut. It had weak debuts in the UK ($900K), France ($700K) and Mexico ($500K), indicating this is gonna be a domestic heavy film.

While ***Dog Man*** was strong in North America, the same cannot be said for its overseas prospects. It debuted in 29 countries, but it earned just $4.2 million, which translates to a $40.4 million worldwide debut. It had a modest start in Spain ($1.1M), while it was very weak in Mexico ($700K) and Italy ($600K). Looks like it will be the rare DreamWorks film to skew higher on the domestic side.

After two months in theaters, ***Gladiator II*** added $450,000 this weekend in the remaining overseas markets. And with this, it has now eclipsed $461.3 million worldwide, finally passing the original ***Gladiator*** ($460.5 million). If only that budget didn't get out of control.

*The Wild Robot* | Sep/27 | Universal | $35,790,150 | $143,901,945 | $326,369,928 | $78M

- DreamWorks' ***The Wild Robot*** has closed with a damn great $326 million worldwide. The film has held very well, achieving the 4x multiplier. It's a big win for DreamWorks, on top of achieving some of its best reviews in their history. They recently announced a sequel is in development, we'll keep an eye on that one.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

The Super Bowl weekend is known to be one of the slowest weekends ever. People prepare to meet up and watch the game (with last year's game being watched by a colossal 123 million viewers, the most watched event in US history), so studios avoid releasing anything big here.

Universal is releasing the action comedy ***Love Hurts***, which stars Ke Huy Quan as a realtor whose past as a violent hitman comes back to haunt him. The marketing emphasizes the action element, while also highlighting that it comes from the producers of ***Nobody*** and ***Violent Night***, both of which were very successful. While it won't take the top spot from ***Dog Man***, perhaps ***Love Hurts*** could surprise.

Sony is also releasing the slasher comedy ***Heart Eyes***, which follows co-workers working late on Valentine's Day who are mistaken for a couple by the infamous Heart Eyes Killer. The horror comedy combo is hit-and-miss at the box office, so Sony wanted to give the film a chance by lifting the review embargo one week early, and the reviews are quite good so far.

I've always found it strange when movies recycle names. So I decided to post a (nonexhaustive) list of famous movies that share a name with another major release that is not as well known. This is actually a phenomenom I've thought about alot over the years. 

1. Running Scared- Classic 80's comedy starring Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines vs. 2006 Paul Walker action movie.

2. Gladiator- Early 90s boxing movie starring a young Cuba Gooding Jr vs. Russell Crowe's Oscar-winning sword and sandal epic.

3. Catch Me if You Can- 80s B-movie about high school drag racer* vs. Steve Speilberg movie with Tom Hanks and Leonardo Dicaprio.

4. Bad Boys- One of Sean Penns first starring roles vs Will Smith/Martin Lawrence franchise starter.

5. Project X- Matthew Broadrick and Helen Hunt in a movie about the Air Force experimenting on chimps vs. A house party goes WAY overboard.

6. The Rookie- Clint Eastwood, Charlie Sheen, Raul Julia cop movie vs. Dennis Quad baseball biopic. 

7. Man of the House- Chevy Chase comedy with JTT vs Tommy Lee Jones comedy.

8. Bad Company- Sexy spy thriller with Lawrence Fishbourne and Ellen Barkin vs. Chris Rock CIA comedy.

9. Crash- Controversial James Spader movie about car crash fetiches vs Controversial Oscar-winner about racism. 

10. Hot Pursuit- 80s John Cusack comedy with Ben Stiller and his father Jerry as villains vs. Reese Witherspoon/Sonia Vergara comedy.


I know there are other examples of this. Any other ones that standout.

*Not a major release but a movie I really loved as a kid.

gladiator,gladiator,1i6ux98,What's the worst movie script you read?,"From what I heard and seen, Nick Cave's Gladiator II script sounded kinda of weird. Maximus going to Heaven, then gets revenge, then at the end of the screenplay, he lives to the modern-day. I say this, Gladiator didn't need a sequel at all, the ending wrapped up perfectly and all loose ends were tied. And Cave knew that Russell Crowe wasn't going to like the script at all, then the script was rejected and scrapped after Steven Spielberg, who had consulted on the original film, told Ridley Scott it wasn't going to work, especially as Cave had written something ""too grand"" due to his theatre work.

I haven't seen the actual Gladiator II and probably never will because of how the first one was so good but I didn't hear good things at all. However, Nick Cave's screenplay wasn't used at all for the real Gladiator II so it was never made.

Then we have the Elf 2 screenplay, I read a few parts of the script a few years back (I don't remember it that well) but it seemed like that it wasn't all that good and interesting. There's a reason why Will Ferrell turned down a huge paycheck to respire his role as Buddy the Elf and even I also think that Elf didn't really need a sequel as it all wrapped up perfectly. I can say that Elf is a classic but no sequel was needed because of how well it wrapped up.

There are tons of more of bad screenplays out there but the two are prime examples of the worst movie scripts I have read.",0,24,1737497579.0,2025-01-21 22:12:59,False

I have a really hard time believing no one in such a huge production didn't know that, even among history consultants they must have used at some point in the project.

Worst of all, they did know but still used them, but for what reason? The opening scene shows mostly catapults being used, yet they decided to show a trebuchet that has absolutely zero impact in the narrative. Same goes with the transparent glassware. I'm not even going to mention all the historical discrepancies between characters and actual historical figures shown, that I can understand they'd justify they're adapted for a more interesting plot, or probably plenty other details that I might have missed.

Why are such huge productions constantly making this types of mistakes? I don't want to be pedantic but it's something that really breaks my immersion.

gladiator,gladiator,1i0w6jg,"January 10-12 Box Office Recap: 'Den of Thieves 2' takes the #1 spot from 'Mufasa' and 'Sonic', debuting with $15 million domestically. However, 'Better Man' massively flopped in its wide expansion, debuting at #13 with a terrible $1 million from 1,291 theaters, against its $110 million budget.","https://preview.redd.it/wyyfpflzhvce1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e6b820d9a6c3bcf91bab0d1448e8d898d5716f5

Turns out the kingdom didn't last long.

Whether it was a surprise or not, ***Den of Thieves 2: Pantera*** managed to dethrone ***Mufasa: The Lion King*** for the top spot at the box office. In some very bad news, the wide expansion of ***Better Man*** was a complete disaster, finishing outside the Top 10.

The Top 10 earned a combined $69.6 million this weekend. That's down 16.8% from last year, when ***Mean Girls*** and ***The Beekeeper*** opened. Despite the current LA fires, the LA market still accounted for 8% of the weekend's gross, which is actually above the usual 7.9% in a normal weekend.

Debuting at #1, ***Den of Thieves 2: Pantera*** earned $15 million in 3,008 theaters. That's almost on par with the original ***Den of Thieves*** ($15.2 million). It's also the first Lionsgate film to hit #1 at the box office since ***The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes*** in 2023 (they've had a very bad run last year).

Even though it arrived 7 years later, clearly the interest was there for a ***Den of Thieves*** sequel. Compared to a lot of recent actions flicks with Gerard Butler, it has maintained that popularity thanks to home media and streaming. But these films corner the exact same market: the dad movie market. There's an audience who simply wants to watch an old-school action movie, and ***Den of Thieves*** delivers that (just like ***The Beekeeper*** did one year ago). The LA fires also didn't do much impact in its box office numbers; the LA market generated 10.4% of the film's box office, which is actually bigger than the original's 9.3% LA share.

According to Lionsgate, 63% of the audience was male. As mentioned, this was a dad movie; 79% of the audience was 25 and over, with 52% over 35. They gave it a ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is the same grade as the original. January looks quite weak, although it will have to compete with stuff like ***Wolf Man*** and ***Flight Risk*** in a few weeks. Nevertheless, it has enough gas to hit $40 million domestically.

The reign of ***Mufasa*** lasted just one weekend, as it had to go back to the second spot. The film dropped 39.4%, adding $14.2 million this weekend. The film has earned $188.7 million, which is a colossal 61% behind the 2019 film through the same point.

In third place, ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** dropped 46.8%, adding $11.3 million. With this, it has not only passed the second film's gross, but it also passed the $200 million milestone. It has earned $204.8 million so far, and it should finish with around $240 million domestically.

In fourth place, Focus Features' ***Nosferatu*** dropped 47.3%, adding $6.8 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to a fantastic $81.8 million, and it's still on pace to finish with over $100 million, assuming it's not killed by ***Wolf Man*** this weekend.

***Moana 2*** fell back to Earth after its holiday boost. It dropped 47.5%, earning $6.5 million this weekend. The film has amassed $434.8 million domestically.

Searchlight's ***A Complete Unknown*** eased 37.4%, adding $5.1 million this weekend. With this, the film has crossed $50 million domestically, although the dream of $100 million died.

***Wicked*** had a slightly rough drop. This time, it fell 48.7%, grossing $5.1 million this weekend. Nevertheless, it's not like Universal ain't hurtin'; the film has made $70 million in PVOD in its first week. The film has earned a fantastic $458 million so far.

In eighth place, A24's ***Babygirl*** is still holding very well despite the end of the holidays. The film eased just 30.6% (the best drop in the top 10), adding $3 million this weekend. The film has earned a damn good $21.7 million so far.

In ninth place, the Indian film ***Game Changer*** earned $2 million from just 805 theaters.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Roadside Attractions' ***The Last Showgirl***, which finally had its wide release after having a limited weekend run at a single theater last month. It debuted with a solid $1.5 million in 870 theaters. While it's set to expand it in to a few more theaters, don't expect it to hit $10 million.

A24 expanded ***The Brutalist*** to 68 theaters, coming off its big wins at the Golden Globes last week. The film grossed a pretty great $1.3 million, which is a very strong $20,408 per-theater average. So far, the film has earned $2.7 million. It will see another expansion this weekend, before finally hitting wide release the following weekend.

***Gladiator II*** fell 53.4%, adding $1.2 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $170.9 million.

We have to go all the way to the #13 spot to find the weekend's other expansion, Paramount's ***Better Man***, the Robbie Williams biopic. We knew it was not gonna break out, given that its limited release numbers were very poor. Yet the film managed to surprise us by going even lower.

***Better Man*** debuted in 1,291 theaters, and the film earned a terrible $1 million. Yep, you read that correctly. That's an anemic $824 per-theater average. Assuming that each theater played this five times a day at a regular $11.90 ticket price, that means that there were just 4 people in each screening. Woah. And to make things worse, the film cost $110 million. Now, Paramount is not deeply invested in here; they only picked the distribution rights to the film for $25 million. They won't lose a lot of money, but this will be another money loss for them.

The American market was never going crazy for a Robbie Williams biopic for a simple reason: they have no idea who Robbie Williams is. That's quite surprising, given that he's the one of the best-selling singers in history (75 million records sold puts him in the same vein as The Weeknd, Green Day, Oasis, Nirvana and Imagine Dragons). But despite his popularity across Europe, Oceania and Latin America, Williams never broke out in America. Only two of his songs made it in the Billboard Top 100 (""Angels"" and ""Millennium"") and they both peaked at #53 and #72. So despite selling out a lot of concerts and records, he's still a complete unknown in America.

There's also the decision that was supposed to be its selling point, but still drew a polarizing reaction. To separate itself from other biopics, the film decided to depict Williams as a CGI chimpanzee. Bonus points for originality, but that also confused the general audience. So the audience are left with two questions ""who is Robbie Williams?"" and ""why is he a chimpanzee?"" Instead of trying to find more or listen to a few songs from Williams, they simply chose to not watch it all. After all, a music biopic is aimed at big fans of a singer, so why would they pay for an artist they don't care about? Even with great reviews (88% on RT and 77 on Metacritic), that's not enough to make them change their mind.

According to Paramount, 56% of the audience was male, and 52% was 25 and over. Despite some great word of mouth (83% on PostTrak, 63% definite recommend), this is not a film that will leg out. It's not gonna hit $5 million domestically, and it's likely it could miss $3 million as well. We want to say it will be saved overseas, but the film has been disappointing in the UK and Australia so far. This is a flop.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Mufasa: The Lion King*** topped the box office with $27.8 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $542 million. The film's best markets are France ($33.7M), UK ($29.9M), Mexico ($24.6M), Germany ($24M) and Italy ($21.8M).

***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** added $20.3 million, as it's nearing $400 million worldwide. Most notably, it opened in China, where it flopped with only a little over $1 million. The film's best markets are UK ($25.9M), Mexico ($18.8M), France ($15.8M), Australia ($13.2M) and Brazil ($9.2M).

***Nosferatu*** added $13.7 million, taking its worldwide total to a fantastic $135.4 million. It's Robert Egger's highest grossing film by a wide margin, passing ***The Northman*** a long time ago. The best markets are the UK ($11.1M), Mexico ($6.03M), Italy ($4.3M), Germany ($3.5M) and Australia ($3.4M).

***Moana*** added $11.1 million, helping it reach $990 million worldwide. The film's best markets are France ($60.6M), UK ($49.7M), Germany ($41.7M), Mexico ($30.2M) and Australia ($29.5M). It's hitting the billion milestone sometime this week.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Venom: The Last Dance* | Oct/25 | Sony | $51,012,404 | $139,755,882 | $474,775,261 | $120M
*Y2K* | Dec/6 | A24 | $2,113,923 | $3,763,863 | $3,763,863 | $15M

- Sony's ***Venom: The Last Dance*** has closed with $474 million worldwide. Despite its poor reception and word of mouth (""B–"" on CinemaScore), the film benefitted from a lack of competition, as studios chose to avoid releasing anything close to the election. A success? Definitely. But the film still ended up making less money than ***Let There Be Carnage***, which was released in worse conditions and had no China grosses. Who knows what's the future for this character.

- A24's ***Y2K*** has closed with a very poor $3.7 million in North America, which is a very bad 1.78x multiplier. Despite Kyle Mooney's interest in filmmaking, the film struggled to balance its horror and comedy elements, but at the end of the day, the audience simply wasn't interested. Let's hope his next film is much better, if he ever gets the chance.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We find two newcomers this weekend.

The first, and perhaps the weekend's winner, is Universal/Blumhouse's ***Wolf Man***. The film is the latest addition in Universal's reboot of their Classic Monsters line-up, after the success of ***The Invisible Man*** (also written and directed by Leigh Whannell). Horror is a very reliable genre, so perhaps we might be looking at another winner here.

The other wide release is Sony's ***One of Them Days***, which stars Keke Palmer and SZA as two friends who seek to avoid eviction. In the current landscape, there's been very few comedies not tied to IPS, so this can be a good test to see the interest in R-rated comedies.

#**ANNOUNCEMENT**

As this weekend falls on the MLK weekend, the actuals will probably be delayed by a day. So the post will go up on Tuesday.

gladiator,gladiator,1hzt7h8,Adam Driver collects great directors like Pokemon,"It's pretty clear to me that Driver's philosophy is that if he works with amazing directors, he's going to improve his chances of being in great movies and improve his craft.  While it doesn't always work out and he sometimes has small roles, for the most part it does seem to pay off.  Driver's average movie score on Metacritic is 70/100 with movies like Baumbach's ""Marriage Story"" (94/100), Coen Brothers' ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" (93/100), Jarmush's ""Paterson"" (90/100) and Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" (87/100) at the top.

Other than Daniel Day Lewis (76/100), you'd struggle to find other actors with average metacritic scores as high as Driver.  For example,  Dicaprio (64/100), Cruise (62/100), Frances McDormand (67/100), Joaquin Phoenix (63/100), Denzel (64/100), Hanks (62/100).

**Additional Thoughts**

* **Flops:** It's interesting that some of the biggest duds Driver has been involved in also happen to be from some of the greatest directors past their prime.  Coppolla's ""Megalopolis"", Gilliam's ""Man who Killed Don Quixote"", Ridley Scott's ""House of Gucci"" a few examples, but if the idea is to soak up everything you can from the greatest to ever do it, your opportunities to work with legends in their mid-80s are limited.
* **Future Targets:**  I imagine there certain consistently panned directors, like Zack Snyder (average metacritic score in the 40s with peak being 59/100), that he'd want to avoid, but I'd take a wild guess that Driver's agent has an open call to directors like Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, Denis Villenueve, etc that's like ""Hey... my boy is ready when you are"".  Who do you guess is at the top of his wish list?
* **Driver a Future Director?:** I don't know if he's ever expressed an interest in making his own projects, but it would be difficult to find someone who has worked on films with that many incredible directors.  You have to imagine he's learned a lot.  That's like the world's greatest filmmaking masterclass.  He kinda owes it to everyone to give directing a shot at some point.",1115,270,1736706436.0,2025-01-12 18:27:16,False

Not out of anger or any kind of extreme emotion, but I was just so uninterested and underwhelmed that without even thinking I just found myself causally get up and leave to go do something else.

gladiator,gladiator,1hy7ttn,Baby Driver is literally a perfect action movie.(for me),"I chose to watch it last night in no seriousness whatsoever after getting disgusted by some Kevin Hart shitty supposedly ""sky heist"" movie and, voila!

 Don't know how to explain this but to keep thinking that if you're gonna make the action movie in these modern days, you HAVE TO make em this way.

 Fast pased, but butter smooth. Every characters and dialogues, filled with the best of the best they can offer till the very last drop. Focus of the movie, (which, in this case, happens to be car chasing, music, literal movie-like love, crime and punishment), spot-on. Nailed. Music is just one greatness of this movie. 

No lies, this has been positioned now as one of the 6 movies that got 2 thumbs up from me on Netflix, rest of them being Godfather, Irishman, Oldboy, Pulp Fiction, All quiets. Now if you really want to go as deep as talking about pure quality of a content, then those 7 names would of course not necesseraily be on the same level. But all of their makers did their best in each of their times, genres, or realms and that's all matters in my opinion. Caption just means this not that its the greatest movie of all time.

If you are willing to share your great finds on Netflix like this film of mine(sorry if this is already greatly well-credited film, I didn't even know existance of this til last night), then please do in the comments.

Also, I list here my dissapointment of films on Netflix to make it easy for you to recommend more preferable ones for me.

gladiator,gladiator,1hxbdxv,The Northman (2022) is one of the best-made action blockbusters of the century.,"_Spoilers Ahead_

I just watched it and I'm absolutely fucking blown away. I've now seen all of Robert Eggers' films, and despite his incredible, pioneering work in the horror genre, this surprisingly may well be my favorite movie of his.

The Northman is the rare ""auteurist blockbuster"" - massive in scale and scope, full of bombastic, big-budget setpieces and genre thrills, and yet not a whiff of commercial pressure or creative compromise to be found. Every frame of this movie feels bespoke, intentional, and dripping in Eggers' style.

Despite having seen all of Eggers' work, the one movie I reflexively associate with him is The Lighthouse, a famously confounding work that defies categorization and keeps the viewer at something of an emotional remove the entire time. With this in mind, the most pleasant surprise of The Northman for me was that despite its unrelenting ruthlessness, and its refreshing refusal to collapse its story into a moral binary, it was still full of deep pathos and an unexpected tenderness that I'm not accustomed to with Eggers. There was a genuinely uplifting, even thrilling quality to the love story (and team-up) with Anya Taylor-Joy's character in the second half that I really didn't expect to feel as resonant as it did.

To go along with this, the movie is absolutely shot through with beauty, more so than any of Eggers' work. The first half manages to keep finding artful, visually arresting ways to frame the ugliest of violence, whereas the second half transforms into a visual love letter to the incomprehensibly beautiful vistas of Iceland. This movie really does have some of the best cinematography I've seen, especially for its genre. (Particularly creative and beautiful were the many scenes set under moonlight, so desaturated as to almost look black and white - that is until a burst of vivid color, usually from a fire, cuts through the monochromatic palette to give us images that look straight from a painting or a comic book. Nosferatu makes extensive use of this look, to similarly gorgeous results.)

Every single performance in this movie blew me away. I'm convinced Alexander Skarsgard is an actual fucking animal wearing human skin - the amount of ferocious physicality he brings to all his roles is a wonder to watch, and he really outdid himself here. (At the same time, the way he charts Amleth's shift from hardened warrior to a sudden vulnerability after he meets Olga - as if the character himself is discovering those emotions for the first time - is beautifully convincing.) Claes Bang, who I recently saw excel at playing a loathsome scumbag in Apple TV's Bad Sisters, is just as brilliant as Fjolnir, a surprisingly more gray and even partially sympathetic character than the film initially lets on. Anya Taylor-Joy brings magnetism and warmth to a character that easily could've been a cliche, convincing me that Amleth would really fall for her, so far as to question his own fate.

And Nicole Kidman, holy fuck. After not having much screentime for most of the movie, she absolutely lets her fangs loose in that twisted, harrowing reunion with Amleth, matching Skarsgard in raw power. The two did career-best work playing husband and wife in the excellent Big Little Lies, and the way Kidman inhabits the other side of that abusive dynamic here as his mother (while also, startlingly, carrying forward the sexual element) was really something to behold.

I also caught a couple of funny meta-connections. Claes Bang previously played Dracula in a Netflix series, whereas Eggers went onto to make Nosferatu. And best of all, Hafthor Bjornsson (aka The Mountain from GOT) shows up as the guy Amleth bests in the ball game, and Amleth kills him in a very similar way to how The Mountain famously killed Oberyn in GOT, basically getting some extra-textual revenge. (I swear I even recognized one or two bits of the Icelandic landscape here from GOT.)

I think overall this movie deserves to go down in history as one of the best action epic ever made, on par with Gladiator, the Dune films, and Nolan's work. Really a labor of love, made with more care and craft than most blockbusters nowadays.",0,40,1736424521.0,2025-01-09 12:08:41,False

gladiator,gladiator,1hvnuw4,My ranking of 2024! ,"I’m going by U.K. release dates, it’s just easier for me and it means I don’t spend the first two months of the year adding movies to my previous year’s lists 

1. The Zone of Interest – One of the most powerful movies I’ve ever seen. Such a simple concept, but so impactful, putting you directly into the shoes of evil in a way that leaves you so unsettled even as the end credits roll. And obviously the sound design is absolutely fantastic, but the visuals and filming style also leave a massive impact. 
2. Challengers – So well structured and tightly plotted, the relationship development and the drama was so good and the end was especially unforgettable. 

3. The Wild Robot – Such a beautiful story of love and nature and community and found family, with absolutely stunning animation. 
4. Conclave – From the stunning cinematography and the colours to the political machinations of the conclave itself, everything about this movie is so tightly done. Explores so much and it never feels like a theme or plot line is under explored or skipped over. The politics unfolds perfectly and it leaves you with so many ideas to think about. And, although everyone in the movie is great, Ralph Fiennes especially has to get best lead actor for this! 
5. All Of Us Strangers – A powerful story about grief and loneliness which lingers long after the end credits and Paul Mescal and Andrew Scott are both wonderful in it. 
6. Wicked – One of my all time favourite musicals and the incredibly long wait was so worth it! An adaptation that retained everything great about the original show, with a stellar cast, brilliant choreography and just enough expansion to round out the plot for the big screen. 
7. His Three Daughters – A deeply emotional and heartfelt portrayal of grief and family, with highly affecting performances from the three leads, and very cleverly directed. 
8. Daughters – An incredibly moving and powerful must watch documentary, about an incredible program, which allows incarcerated fathers to have a father daughter dance with their daughters. It’s also immaculately directed by Angela Patton and Natalie  Rae and they do such a good job at weaving so many stories together, while simultaneously deftly exploring the deeper issues at play within the US prison system. 
9. Lisa Frankenstein – Totally weird and unique in the best way possible, very darkly funny, great set design and costuming and a very fun plot overall. Feels like a Heathers-esque future cult classic. 
10. Wicked Little Letters – fantastic writing and dialogue, really funny, brilliant performances and I loved that it was a true story 
11. One Life – A beautiful true story and it made me cry. 
12. The End We Start From – A story of hope, resilience and survival in hard times, with a great lead performance from Jodi Comer. 
13. American Fiction – a very funny, biting and incredibly well written satire, which effortlessly explores many complex themes, whilst also functioning very effectively as a comedy at the same time. 
14. My Old Ass – A really funny and surprisingly emotional examination 
15. The Outrun – A wonderful performance from Saiorse Ronan, a story about addiction, crashing and rising back up and I loved how cyclical, dreamy and hazy the whole thing felt. The cinematography and locations also stunning. 
16. Seize Them — Absolutely hilarious, very well written and a 10/10 cast. 
17. The Bikeriders – An epic and well told deconstruction of biker culture, which maintains multiple stories at once and does all of them justice, while also telling a very interesting and tragic true story
18. Wallace and Gromit: Vengance Most Fowl – A wonderful comeback for one of the best animated franchises of all time. Witty, so many funny details, a great commentary on AI and it was just lovely to have Wallace and Gromit back on Christmas Day. 
19. Better Man – A bold, original, creative and very emotionally compelling biopic with a great soundtrack 
20. Snack Shack – A warm, witty, nostalgic, summery and overall very  funny portrayal of teenage life
21. The Fall Guy – A great surprise and a fantastic tribute to stunt people. Very funny, meta, emotionally impactful and it had a great love story. 
22. Woman of The Hour – this manages to be a fantastic portrayal of a real life story, an exploration of the dangers women face even today and a really tightly made thriller. A fantastic directorial debut for Anna Kendrick, who also does a great job in the lead role. 
23. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice – One of my biggest pleasant surprises of the year. So fun and funny! Just a great, creative, madcap adventure. And I loved the use of practical effects. 
24. Dune Part 2 – Epic, incredible cinematography, great performances and much more tightly plotted than the first film. 
25. We Live In Time – Warm, funny and heartbreaking at the same time. And I loved seeing Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh together. 
26. The Color Purple – A big, bright, colourful, unapologetic musical, with a classic empowering and beautiful story of a woman who goes through so much and finds her identity with the support of other women. 
27. Kneecap – As funny as it is dynamically filmed, it also has some great deeper messages at play. 
28. The Holdovers – Another cozy and funny Christmas movie, with a strong emotional core and great character development. 
29. That Christmas – A very heartwarming, funny and cozy Christmas film. 
30. Monkey Man – A well paced, well directed and emotional action thriller.  
31. Blitz – A great snapshot of a fascinating moment in history, with great cinematography and a really epic feel overall. I also really enjoyed the way that George was able to explore and examine his identity as a mixed race child in England at this time. Although the blitz is so covered as a historical period, this really did feel like a fresh perspective. 
32. The Piano Lesson – a classic play, well built tension and a stellar cast. 
33. Gladiator 2 – Not a massively strong plot, but epic, stunningly shot and highly enjoyable overall. 
34. Joy – A heartwarming portrayal of an important story and a lovely tribute to its characters. 
35. Jim Henson: Idea Man – A loving, informative and creatively made tribute to an incredible man with an incredible life. 
36. Young Woman and the Sea – A very interesting biopic with some stunning cinematography. 
37. Love Lies Bleeding – A really tense and well made crime thriller, with good performances and an interesting critique on toxic and abusive relationships.
38. Civil War – A really pleasant surprise and not what I expected at all. A biting and fascinating exploration of the ethics of war reporting and photojournalism. The only reason it’s not much higher is that (and I do understand what they were trying to do with it tbf), I felt the vagueness of the conflict with clues hidden here and there distracted a bit from what the film was trying to say and explore overall. 
39. Anora – Overall, Anora is a fascinating, funny and moving character and trope de-construction. The only reason it’s not much higher on my list is that the middle drags a bit and the dialogue is pretty repetitive at times. 
40. Fancy Dance – A moving film with an especially good performance from Lily Gladstone, exploring issues faced by indigenous families to great emotional impact. But I did think it ended a bit abruptly without much resolution. 
41. The Critic – An intriguing murder mystery with lots of twists and turns, as well as great performances, especially from Ian Mckellen. 
42. Paddington in Peru – Not as good as the first two Paddington films, but still a fun and funny adventure that’s well worth a watch. 
43. Moana 2 – stunning animation and an enjoyable plot. The only three things that drag it down a bit for me: the music isn’t nearly as good as the first one and the fact that you can hear that it’s an attempt to mimic LMM’s music from the first movie made it worse. The villains were pretty weak. And without spoiling it too much I wasn’t a big fan of certain things that happen to Moana at the end. 
44. Lee – A really interesting insight into someone with an extraordinary life. Kate Winslet and Andy Samberg were great in it too. 
45. Carry On – A tense and enjoyable thriller that builds up its plot well. Not a masterpiece, but a really fun afternoons’ watch. 
46. Bad Tidings – A great Christmas comedy with two of my favourite comedians.
47. Rob Peace – A lovely tribute to someone with a tragic life.
48. Deadpool and Wolverine – funny with a very clever meta narrative and a great use of music. I didn’t like the first Deadpool that much and I skipped the second one, but this is absolutely the strongest of the trilogy.
49. Bob Marley: One Love – A really interesting insight into an icon. 
50. Inside Out 2 – As funny, clever and emotionally effective as the last film. But it just gave me everything I liked about the first film and didn’t really push the boundaries of the Inside Out world in the way that it could have and that I hoped it would. 
51. Suncoast – An emotionally affecting film with great performances. Nico Parker is especially great, but Woody Harrelson’s character feels a bit pointless and the mum is pretty terrible. 
52. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire – A fun and funny addition to an iconic for a reason franchise. 
53. Turtles All The Way Down – A cute teen film with an especially effective portrayal of the mental health side of the story. But some of the subplots did feel a bit bizarre and unecessary with not so great execution. 
54. Mother’s Instinct – a fairly standard slightly soapy thriller with good performances that builds tension well. 
55. Shirley – An interesting story, but not told in an overly exciting way. 
56. Fly Me To The Moon – A sweet and entertaining love story that just dragged a bit too much towards the end for me. 
57. Mean Girls – I had fun with this especially as a musical theatre fan. The music from the Broadway show is good, it was funny and the performances were enjoyable. But it was a bit dragged down by some of the adaptation choices, mainly in the music. It felt like they were ashamed that it was a musical and that they kept trying to de-Broadway the songs to make it “cool”, which I didn’t feel was necessary. 
58. Spaceman – An interesting and surprisingly emotional concept, even if it was a bit strange. 
59. Kinds Of Kindness – great cast and interesting thematic links between the three stories, but I felt it went on a bit too long in the end. 
60. Find Me Falling – just a bland Netflix romance. Not the worst thing I’ve ever seen but not great either. 
61. Damsel – although it was very generic girl power and wasn’t the best quality overall, the action was entertaining and I did find the plot engaging. 
62. The Garfield Movie – This was cute and fairly entertaining for what it was, but didn’t go beyond that for me. 
63. Drive Away Dolls – This had some potential as a witty crime caper, but the plot felt thin, rushed and underdeveloped for me. 
64. The Hit Man – I get that the characters being terrible was kind of the point, but I didn’t find them or the film as a whole very engaging. 
65. A Different Man – I felt like this had so much potential in the beginning, but once the post change stuff started I didn’t really understand what it was trying to say, other than saying that the struggles we saw throughout the entire first half was just because of his attitude, which is a terrible message if that was the intention. 
66. Back To Black – the actress playing Amy Winehouse did a decent job, but it focused way too much on her personal life and not nearly enough on her music and felt like it didn’t do her justice overall. 
67. Emilia Pérez – A not too bad idea executed in the most bizarre and jarring way possible. 
68. The Persian Version – I was excited for this one from the trailer, but it felt like the director wanted to tell so many different stories and couldn’t effectively concentrate on any of them. 
69. A Family Affair – Started off kind of funny at the very beginning with Zack Efron playing a big headed movie star, but the plot got very strange and terrible very quickly. 
70. Despicable Me 4 – As someone who honestly loved the first Despicable Me, it’s been so sad to see all the heart slowly sapped out of the franchise, with this nothing of a film being the end result. It’s funny in some places, but there’s so little plot, heart and character development that it’s honestly depressing. All the characters and situations are just a vehicle for comedy, with nothing else added in, leaving the whole thing feeling empty overall. ",0,12,1736242517.0,2025-01-07 09:35:17,False

gladiator,gladiator,1ht724v,Expansive Re-releases....the new sequels?,"You know how films like Saturday Night Fever and Gladiator demand any studio marketing department to develop an unnecessary sequel that people end up bashing or comparing to the first film as the legacy gets destroyed?


Why not make expansive re-releases to both preseve the legacy of the original film while also allowing original actors to return to their roles even if their characters are dead?

Think about it, we have CGI and A.I. which helps an actor lend their voice and likes while also preserving their youth with said technology.


In other words, we all can get a proper re-release of films like Quantum of Solace, which was plagued by the writer's strike and the film ended up looking rather empty with less story and drama. Such a film could have it's original actors return to lend their likes and voices to expand the film and make it the way it was meant to be made. This way a studio doesn't have to spend as much money producing a whole new sequel while also not having to care so much about script logic on making a sequel to such a film while also generating more revenue from its own property.

For a film like Saturday Night Fever, if the film was made within 5 years of the original, they could have had the cast members from the film return while looking similarly youthful. And in celebration of the first film they could have filmed more transition scenes and dance scene to buttress and ENHANCE the first film rather than tarnish its legacy with that sequel.


You know how most studios produce sequels with more action/kill counts rather than character driven development in most sequels? They can continue adding more say....dance/action scenes within the context of the first film and therefore re-release the first film with legacy redux and expansion. 

Every film can use an extra few scenes to help them make better sense.",0,2,1735967259.0,2025-01-04 05:07:39,False

gladiator,gladiator movie,1jwyr9i,Gladiator II made me finally understand the greatness and uniqueness of Russell Crowe's iconic performance.,"When i was a kid and watched Gladiator, i obviously thought Russell Crowe was great as Maximus, but in the following years i never necessarily understood why he won an Oscar for it.

It's not the typical role and performance for which you are considered worthy of an Oscar, it's not a baity biopic about a real-life famous and beloved figure or an arthouse challenging auteur-driven project, it's an heroic figure in a sandal and sword blockbuster.

What could be so great about this performance that you even win an Oscar for it??

I didn't get it until recently when i saw on theaters the awaited sequel.

Gladiator II and Paul Mescal's performance in it (and i really like him as an actor) made me revalue and understand how hard it is to play convincingly an heroic role like that and how easy and effortless Crowe made it look like.

It's an iconic performance that still resonates today, but not necessarily for reasons the general public thinks about.

He managed to do character-actor work, immersing himself into this character and creating a three-dimensional human being out of this two-dimensional role and also imbue it with huge and rugged movie star charisma and such fierce intensity.

With Crowe's presence, there's such depth and gravitas into a role that on paper could have easily ended up being so flat and dull in the hands of many and many other actors, even good ones.

He's stoic, but never dull or uninteresting, he's absolutely magnetic, always elevating every scene with a ferocious potency.

It's almost a throwback to those powerful, big, theatrical, and commanding performances you would see on those sword and sandal epics of the 40s-50s-60s, but updated, modernized, and made accessible for the audiences of the new millennium.

It's a hard feat he pulled off, much harder than many people think, it's simply not a performance you can just imitate and replicate, and watching recently Mescal trying to inhabit that same type of stoic character made me realize it much more.

Russell's performance wasn't just ""playing the hero"" or the good soldier, there was a personality and specific characterization you can't just copy, an entrancingly unique magnetism you can't just hope to recapture on film.

He's not just great, like i always thought, but quite frankly, no other actor in the world could have played Maximus and suddenly turn it into an Oscar winning role.

It's an unusual, unique, and absolutely deserved Oscar win, and a reminder of Crowe's unique talents and why he became a full fledged movie star after always having been a great actor.

I hope one day we will see him again in another role worthy of him and make a great comeback.

gladiator,gladiator movie,1jpgg9b,What is Hollywood's obsession with portraying Roman emperors as super sassy?,"I just watched Gladiator 2 on a plane and was absolutely shocked at how the two roman emperors were portrayed.  I think they even had them wearing eyeliner and everything.

I've read a couple of books about Roman history and I've never heard about their emperors behaving like this.  For one, Justinean's wife Theodora was a hardcore child prostitute before marrying Justinean and becoming empress ...I know that's just one example, but I can't imagine Justinean or any of his predecessors that I read about sitting around wearing makeup, feeding grapes to their fun-boys, and acting all dainty like that.
No military generals would take off on years long military campaigns for leaders like that....these are the same people who viciously merked Julius Ceaser let's not forget.  

I also doubt highly that such leaders would have throngs of hardworking common folks out in the streets supporting them in public as depicted in the movie ",0,8,1743568638.0,2025-04-02 05:37:18,False

gladiator,gladiator movie,1jd7pus,"What are the quintessential ""mom movies""?","Okay so at this point, we have an idea of what can fall into or be described as a dad movie. Not all are like this but they usual fall into one of the following;

* Sports films about male athletes/male teams. For a while baseball was the main sport, but boxing, racing, and football (American football, there aren't that many notable regular football films) have been accepted.
* Espionage films about a man who uncovers a ""sinister Terrorist conspiracy"" plot and is now on the run to unveil the truth while staying alive. Bonus points if the villain is actually the FBI or CIA.
* Revenge thriller about a father and or husband seeking revenge all on his own with nothing but a few guns, unpolished fighting skills, and hacking skills (or has a hacker friend helping). Bonus points if the villain is revealed to have previously been a friend who ""turned his back on his country"" and the hero is revealed to be working for or worked for the FBI or CIA.
* Crime / gangster films typically set either in New York, Boston, Vegas, or Miami. Typically following Italian or Latin American crime bosses or gangsters.
* Court room dramas about a white lawyer fighting for justice in an unfair criminal system or a witness/juror trying to do the right thing
* Sword & sandal movies (which is typically just Gladiator or Braveheart)
* Westerns

That's all well and good but what about ""mom movies?"" What for you are tropes of a ""mom movie"" and what are some examples.

Most would assume these would be your romcoms or films about being a mother. And those are popular amongst women and mothers but honestly, when I think about stories moms like, the first I actually think of crime dramas. Specifically, films where a woman is in the middle of a murder plot and people are trying to figure out who the culprit is, what the relation is to the woman, or if the woman is actually the perpetrator. And despite it being a film about murder, the violence is just tolerable - nothing is too graphic.

**Gone Girl** and **The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo** are the biggest example of this but you also have films like **A Simple Favor**, **Where the Crawdads Sing**, **Nocturnal Animals**, and **Girl on the Train**.

gladiator,gladiator movie,1j8fbxn,Movies that would have been improved by a lesser known cast,"I'm rewatching Signs (2002) by M. Night Shyamalan (a brilliant director that was eventually treated very unfairly). The movie was a critical and commercial hit and I really enjoyed it.  But it occurs to me now on rewatch that much as I enjoyed this, it would have worked better with relative unknowns, rather than with an already legendary Mel Gibson and new bonafide star Joaquin Phoenix, fresh off his big break from his iconic role in Gladiator a mere two years prior. 

The thing is that I don't really buy them as brothers of a rural family in Pennsylvania. It was something that vaguely nagged me (but I couldn't figure it out) when I saw the movie in theaters back then.  But on rewatch, I am now clear about my what was bothering me: they just don't belong in this setting. They are both brilliant actors that can fit anywhere, so I'd say it's it's a directorial issue. 

When I picture this movie with charactor actors that are not huge stars, it feels like an improvement. I understand that Shyamalan was at the height of his career at the time and could command all kinds of A-List celebs. But I think it might have been better to go low. Perhaps the movie would have been less of a hit, but it might have been better.

I don't expect anyone to agree with me, as I have never even heard this opinion before. 

But leaving aside this particular movie, **are there any films that you think would be improved by a lesser known cast?**

I'm not asking about miscasts. Rather, you may even love the original actors, but think that a particular role would work better if the actor was not a star.

**42. Lisa Frankenstein - 3.75/10** 

Great aesthetics, but a total mess. Felt like three different scripts mashed together. Incomprehensible character arcs. Really enjoyed the first thirty minutes or so, which made the second and third acts all the more disappointing and confusing.

**41. They Called Him Mostly Harmless - 4/10** 

An Instagram reel worth of info spread out across 2 hours.

**40. Stopmotion - 4/10** 

Booooring. I like stop motion, and it is a cool concept to base a horror flick around, but it’s never used in a particularly interesting way. I think the director thought the concept of stop motion animation was in and of itself much more creepy than it actually comes across. There is VERY limited usage that felt interesting/unsettling, but it’s a section that only lasts about a minute. Slow burn and the payoff is nill.

**39. Juror #2 - 4.5/10** 

Not a fan of the way Eastwood usually writes dialog. Felt like a soap opera. Similar to *12 Angry Men*, it’s a “grown up” legal drama that expects you not to really have an understanding of the way juries work. Which is fine, but the on-screen happenings have to be interesting, and this was far from that. Very impressed that he's still making movies though!

**38. Love Lies Bleeding - 5.25/10**

Well done and well acted with some cool symbolism/surrealistic elements woven in, but I just didn’t find it to be an interesting enough story. Never felt invested or hooked. And, even though it is very slowly paced, the dynamics between characters still felt rushed. Liked the style but not the substance - loved the sound design especially. Still, a slog.

**37. Emilia Perez - 5.5/10** 

A potentially special movie marred by a steady stream of kind of baffling errors. There were parts I loved, but the parts that were bad were sophomoric to a point that it was hard for that not to be the main takeaway. Selena Gomez is the perfect representation of what is wrong about this movie. Not only is her acting and accent work absolutely terrible, she seemingly doesn’t even know how a number of the words she’s speaking are supposed to be pronounced. How does a movie with the pedigree and aspirations of this one not course correct something like that?When the film’s at its best, it has this ethereal, beautiful quality to it - like something out of a dream. A number of songs I loved, but more I hated. Some beautiful moments followed up by something so obvious and trite it had my eyes rolling out of my head. A film in extremes.

**36. Maxxxine - 5.75/10** 

Kind of a mess. Very disjointed plotting without a particularly satisfying arc. I do love this character, but it seems like they ran out of material for her.

**35. The Beekeeper - 6/10** 

I love how constant the bee talk, references, and puns are. You’d have thought the studio would have noticed that the line “I’ve got to protect the hive” was repeated ten times in the first 45 mins and told them to turn it down, but this is not that kind of movie. It’s a little too serious to be a full-on parody, which I do think holds it back. Probably would have been a fun short film, gets a little boring.

**34. All We Imagine as Light - 6/10** 

Beautiful, poetic writing, but this thing was pretty brutal to get through. Painfully slow. Appreciated the themes of class consciousness, religion, and sexuality/love in Mumbai, but it just did not hold my attention at all. If you’re into slow cinema, I could see it working for you.

**33. Deadpool and Wolverine - 6.25/10** 

Rewards a lot of inside baseball knowledge of superhero studio politics. I found myself going “oh, I get that” way more than actually chuckling. A lot of references presented as jokes, and even the jokes that were in the movie didn’t really land with me. I did enjoy the relationship built between the two leads. Action was all low or no-stakes.There is an homage to the *Oldboy* hallway scene towards the end, which was more visually interesting than most of the action, but not enough to get me on board. I just think *Deadpool’s* not for me.

**32. Tuesday - 6.25/10** 

Wanted to love it. Beautiful premise/visuals but very strange tonally. Some awkward millennial “so random” kind of humor. Would have worked better if it were more focused on the individuals involved and their relationship. I found *A Monster Calls* to be a much better version of this sort of story.

**31. The Brutalist - 6.25/10** 

Had the aesthetic of a great American epic, but not the substance. Like a kid playing dress-up. I could feel that the director was trying to make an “important” movie - and though I do appreciate the ambition - it felt contrived. Didn’t feel at all new or inventive.Also quite shallow; there were a number of interesting potential story threads, but most were either unexplored or abandoned. The passing of time felt rushed in a way that sometimes meant that we skipped past potentially interesting moments. Very (I’d say comically) dramatic acting without enough actual drama.The score - though underused - was fantastic and the shots really were beautiful and inventive. I did appreciate how unique the story structure was, and how well it would have worked had the material been better. First half was quite a bit better than the second.

**30. Nosferatu - 6.5/10** 

Disappointing; my most anticipated of the year. Can’t overstate how beautiful this movie is to look at. Every frame could be a painting. Unfortunately, it’s so high octane, there’s not space for dread to be built, and it all becomes noise.Characters are constantly - and I mean constantly - acting absolutely terrified. Felt like a beautiful, artsy *Michael Bay* horror flick. The acting style is also clearly intended to mirror the pre-*Brando* “showy” style of acting, but feels distracting and off-puttingly anachronistic in a movie that looks as cutting edge as this one does.

**29. Furiosa - 6.75/10** 

Some cool world-building stuff that I enjoyed, but may have worked better as a TV show to dive deeper into those dynamics. The action sequences felt very glossy and uninspired; huge downgrade from *Fury Road*. This would have been a solid “It’s on TNT, let’s just throw it on” kind of movie from fifteen years ago.

**28. Longlegs - 7/10** 

Nick Cage’s character is the only real standout; he rides the edge of ridiculous and terrifying so well. A bit of a bore outside of his performance, but totally serviceable horror flick.

**27. Woman of the Hour - 7/10** 

Pretty okay! A serial killer movie, where the horror on screen was communicated much more through the way the women were intimidated and demeaned on the way to being killed than the actual kill itself. I didn't feel quite so hit over the head by the message as something like *Promising Young Woman; I* felt like it was mostly handled quite effectively. 

There were definitely some moments - mostly later in the movie - that made me roll my eyes a bit. The scene where *Anna Kendrick* is actually on the show felt like pretty uninspired wish fulfillment. The main character's someone with modern values who gets to clap back at the bad guys, which I find to be a fairly common - if not quite manipulative - way to make the audience feel like the good guy without delving deeper into why things were the way they were in that time. There's a scene towards the end of the movie that really was remarkable in how tense it was; reminded me of some of the better scenes from *Zodiac*.

**26. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice - 7.25/10** 

A bit soulless, but still has some fun moments and cool visuals. Seems like Burton had maybe four different ideas for what he wanted the sequel to be and couldn’t pick any.Monica Bellucci’s role is especially undeveloped and strange. I wish that it had leaned into the weird or over-the-top elements a bit more than it did.

**25. My Old Ass - 7.25/10** 

Sweet little movie. Fun premise and great performances. Not enough forward momentum.

**24. Hundreds of Beavers - 7.25/10** 

Some very fun and funny stuff, but I would have enjoyed it more as a short than as a feature. There’s a reason *Looney Tunes* cartoons aren’t two hours long.Always fun seeing the novel ways indie filmmakers can work around low budgets.

**23. The Wild Robot - 7.5/10** 

Pretty good. Felt very much like a children’s flick, which it is, but didn’t transcend those bounds in the way that a *Monsters Inc.* or *Toy Story* do.All about not fitting in and being yourself, which is basically every children’s movie. Might just be that I’m old and cranky.

**22. Oddity - 7.5/10** 

Solid horror movie with an A+ beginning. Some really creepy imagery.

**21. Didi - 7.5/10** 

Good coming-of-age flick, but I don’t love coming-of-age movies. Clearly very personal to the director. Didn’t resonate as much with me.

**20. Late Night with the Devil - 7.5/10** 

Fun horror flick with a pretty unique setting. Maybe a bit milquetoast, but overall enjoyable.

**19. Kinds of Kindness - 7.75/10** 

Three short films. Might have enjoyed them more individually, as they start to run together a bit. Quite funny and very weird.

**18. I Brake for Caterpillars - 8/10**

Great dark comedy written and directed by my chess buddy, Ken Green.

**17. Dune: Part Two - 8/10**

Beautiful visuals; really does feel epic. I think this movie would work better if viewed immediately after *Part One*, as it can sort of take your breath away with how constant the action is.On its own, it feels like a theme park ride more than it does a film; again, an issue that goes away if marathoned. Villains felt shallow.

**16. Hit Man - 8/10** 

Very fun. Glen Powell oozes charisma. Great range too, came away very impressed by him.Felt like there were some tonal issues where it didn’t know if it wanted to be serious or silly. Quite enjoyable overall.

**15. Caddo Lake - 8/10** 

A puzzle to put together as much as it is a movie. Little context for what’s happening until about an hour through, which made it hard to really feel invested in what was going on. It was very well executed and an interesting premise/mystery, but it does take some concentration, and it was easy to get overwhelmed or confused. The character work all felt great and real.

**14. In the Land of Saints & Sinners - 8/10** 

Great *Liam Neeson* action (adjacent) flick. I saw a lot of parallels between this and *Unforgiven*, though this movie was quite a bit softer.Neeson can chew scenery like no other, and Joffrey was great too. Feel like I can see him being a more buttoned-up *Barry Keoghan* type. Could have used a better group of villains and did feel a bit slow in spots.Surprised by how beautiful this movie was to look at and how much care they put into composition.

**13. A Different Man - 8.25/10** 

Thoughtful commentary on identity and personality. Some subtle *Lynchian* stylings, which I appreciated. Could have been trimmed down.

**12. Speak No Evil - 8.25/10** 

Wonderfully tense. *James McAvoy* may be the best working actor today.Really interesting premise, explores how people are so willing to be polite that they’ll ignore very obvious red flags so as not to ruffle feathers. Really enjoyed the twists and turns (which are totally ruined if you watch the trailer).Feels like logic flies out the window a bit towards the end. One of our protagonists comes out seeming cartoonishly competent and the other cartoonishly incompetent.Curious now to watch the 2022 original.

**11. Strange Darling - 8.25/10** 

Absolutely love the style. Twisted and twisty; keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I love the way that - from the very beginning - the structure makes you feel off balance (the film says it’s 5 chapters and then starts with chapter 3).Female lead was fantastic. Very weak final twenty minutes or so. Not sure if I agree with the film’s overall message/politics.

**10. The First Omen - 8.25/10** 

Very effective satanic horror flick with some really disturbing and interesting set pieces. Legitimately creepy; on par with the original in that regard.Could have benefited from cutting about 30 minutes towards the end. The final act suffers from showing too much and not leaving enough to the imagination.The end was the only section that really felt overtly “fan-servicey,” but it was so overt and awkward that it felt like a post-credit scene in a *Marvel* movie—very weird and silly in this context.Overall, a very good movie that could have been a classic if they had just chopped off the final act.

**9. The Substance - 8.5/10** 

Very fun body horror flick, led by a great performance by *Demi Moore*. Very interesting concept.I didn’t feel it in the moment, but I can see how there are moments that could be really emotionally resonant for certain people watching—all about an unwillingness to deal with aging and the pain that comes with fading beauty. Love how disgusting the camera work makes everything feel. The close-ups of *Dennis Quaid* eating may have been the grossest parts of a very gross body-horror movie.Really interesting how the film satirizes “sex sells” by making the sexual imagery SO over the top. They do some interesting stuff at the end, but I do think it could have used some editing down.The final act of the film lost a fair bit of momentum due to being so drawn out. I’m also tired of the “everything devolves into violence” trope; feels like a cop-out at this point.

**8. Wicked: Part One - 8.5/10** 

Didn’t really want to see it; I saw it on stage and thought it was just okay. Thought it was quite slow to start, but was totally invested by the end.Loved the look and effects. Didn’t feel stretched out. The pauses in the songs all felt natural and cinematic to me. Don’t love the music overall, but a few stood out. *Ariana Grande’s* a great comic actress, and the woman playing *Elphaba* has one of the more expressive faces I’ve seen; she was the perfect actress to get you to feel what she was feeling. A spectacle.

**7. Conclave - 8.75/10** 

Very well acted and shot. Not high art, but a super entertaining/fun political thriller.A lot of the conflict in the film felt small in a way that made everything feel much more grounded and real. I did appreciate the messaging, even if some of the moralizing could feel on the nose.Excited to watch this one again.

**6. Baby Reindeer - 9/10 (Limited series that felt like a 4-hour movie, so here it goes)** 

Loved how raw this felt. Not a conventional story at all with a uniquely imperfect protagonist.Its four-hour runtime really does allow it the space to make what might feel corny or melodramatic in a 90-minute film feel earned and heartbreaking in this one.Incredible performances all around. *Courtney* and I were glued to the screen the whole time.

**5. I Saw the TV Glow - 9/10** 

A movie I enjoyed thinking about as much—or more—than I enjoyed actually watching. Profound. Presents likely the best metaphor I’ve come across for existential dread and living through a life you’re not supposed to. Maybe transgenderism?(Later edit: I’ve since read that the director is trans and explicitly says that it is about the trans experience.)Very open to interpretation; stayed with me for weeks. Some really stunning visuals. Could have dull moments, but much more than the sum of its parts once it all comes together and likely the most important movie I will see this year.

**4. A Real Pain - 9.25/10** 

A fairly typical road-trip dramedy that feels very *Odd Couple meets Garden State* until about halfway through, at which point it becomes something new. In one of the more powerful single scenes I’ve watched, all of those genre tropes are suddenly shifted and subverted, and it becomes a uniquely vulnerable look into the psyche of the magnetic/difficult personality type.*A Real Pain* chooses to look at its characters with a seriousness and introspection that’s really uncommon. Maybe a little too much Chopin—got distracting.

**3. Red Rooms - 9.25/10** 

One of the most physically uncomfortable thrillers I’ve ever watched, with one of the all-time most disturbing single scenes—all the more noteworthy that it’s done without actual violence or gore depicted.An exploration of how dehumanizing and perverse true crime as a genre and hobby can get.

**2. It’s What’s Inside - 9.25/10** 

Has a distinct pop aesthetic that feels very “of today” and exciting. Incredibly stylish and fun.Kind of a low-brow concept on paper, but it’s taken as far—and in as many directions—as you could imagine it could be.Doesn’t take the easy, low-hanging fruit to engage your interest. On paper, the plot and premise are quite complicated, so it’s impressive just how easy it all is to follow in practice.

**1. Anora - 9.5/10** 

Might be a perfect movie. Begins beautiful and idyllic—like a music video suddenly becoming reality—and turns into something equal parts heart-wrenching and hilarious; a wildly entertaining deconstruction of a fairy tale.*Sean Baker’s* most traditionally staged film—definitely not shot on an iPhone this time—but still doesn’t lose the soul that his grittier pictures have.Great naturalistic dialog that allows the chemistry of the cast to take center stage. Love how *Baker* shines a light on people on the margins of society without judgment; he doesn’t glorify—this isn’t *Pretty Woman*—but he doesn’t cast stones.

gladiator,gladiator movie,1iw3trn,Great movies where supporting actor arc is your favorite part with rewatches,"Sometimes when you first watch a movie, the protagonist(s) are so front and center that while you realize the supporting characters are good, you don't realize how important they are to the quality of the film. This can be because they have less screen time or they play a villain. But after watching it several times, you start to realize that you prefer the supporting character's part even more than the protagonist, at least in terms of several watches, because the characters are more rich and meaningful than first realized.

It just dawned on me recently rewatching Forrest Gump that as much as I love Gump's journey, I now find Lieutenant Dan's to be my favorite character arc.

What are some movies where the supporting actor(s) with less screen time have wound up being perhaps your favorite chacracter arc of a great movie. Here are some examples so far imo:

The Dark Knight: Harvey Dent/Aaron Eckhart

Forrest Gump: Lietenant Dan/Gary Sinise

Jaws: Quint/Robert Shaw

gladiator,gladiator movie,1ir45dr,The Pain of Modern Sequels,"This is one part rant, one part observations. The point I'm about to make is speaking in general terms, I'm sure some people out there will be able to think of examples outside of what I'll be saying.

So I'll ask, has anyone noticed a HUGE difference in quality between sequels from back in the day and modern sequels? (let's say modern is approximately things post-2010) And let's say sequels includes any subsequent films in a series, so this includes prequels or spin-offs.

Back in the Day Sequels: Aliens, Terminator 2, Empire Strikes Back, The Dark Knight, Temple of Doom etc.

Modern Sequels: Gladiator II, War of the Rohirrim, the entire Disney Star Wars trilogy, Alien Romulus.

All those Back in the Day movies are regarded as at least as good as the original or even better, and are obviously classics. I think this is because they follow the golden rule of ""Build on what the original established, but show us something new"". So why is it so hard for modern sequels to follow this same rule?

The modern sequels I listed are PASSABLE entertainment, I got some enjoyment from Gladiator and Alien, but I had ZERO emotional response to them. My main problem with so many of these movies is they do the OPPOSITE of that golden rule. They undo or ruin things from the originals, and then show us things we've already seen.  
Gladiator II has almost the exact same plot, and literally undoes the ending of the original.  
War of the Rohirrim barely had a plot, was almost the same story as Two Towers, and so much of the dialogue in the movie was repeated or slightly adapted lines from Two Towers...  
Alien Romulus is full of references to the first 2 movies, even when it doesn't make any sense (the famous line).  
And I don't think I need to talk about Disney Star Wars, I could do a whole post for each of those, but they do the same thing.

So is anyone else bothered by this? Extremely lazy writing that does nothing to justify the existence of the sequels. I find it kind of insulting that they think nostalgia is enough to make me enjoy a movie, it's basically just key jingling for adults. I can go back and watch those old sequels over and over and still feel emotional, but with those modern sequels I doubt I'll ever watch or think about them again. Thoughts?

Okay, gonna add a footnote here because people seem to be misunderstanding my point:  
I'm not talking about BAD sequels, I'm aware there are many bad sequels throughout history. I'm talking about sequels that literally just repeat things from the originals, right down to lines of dialogue, and I've noticed this way more often with modern sequels.",0,22,1739743979.0,2025-02-16 22:12:59,False

gladiator,gladiator movie,1imixm4,"February 7-9 Box Office Recap: 'Dog Man' was still #1, but collapsed 62%, one of the steepest drops for an animated film. 'Heart Eyes' had a fine start with $8.3M, while 'Love Hurts' flopped with just $5.8M. In China, 'Ne Zha 2' becomes the first ever film to make $1 billion in one country.","https://preview.redd.it/7mjckxzmzdie1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=018f6af12666b3411065658a7cfdf54c2cfcb950

Unsurprisingly it was a quiet weekend due to the Super Bowl.

While this is hailed as one of the best Super Bowl weekends post-COVID, it gets less great when you read between the lines and see how most of these films floundered. ***Dog Man*** easily held the top spot, but it's looking clear that the film is proving to be front-loaded. Two newcomers dared to open on the weekend and it was a mixed bag; ***Heart Eyes*** had a fine start, while ***Love Hurts*** flopped.

But the real story was in China, where ***Ne Zha 2*** broke the $1 billion barrier in the country alone. A feat never accomplished before.

The Top 10 earned a combined $46.4 million this weekend. That's up a massive 59% from last year, when ***Argylle*** topped a slow weekend while ***Lisa Frankenstein*** flopped.

DreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** stayed on top on its second weekend, adding $13.8 million this weekend. That represents an awful 62% drop from last weekend, which is one of the steepest for an animated film. That's almost on par with *Lightyear* (64.1%) and only a bit better than *The Simpsons Movie* (66.1%).

While the Super Bowl often causes films to have larger-than-usual drops, ***Dog Man*** was already looking iffy before the weekend started. The film had a colossal 91.3% drop on Monday (animated films usually drop 70%, with 80% or higher in extremely rare scenarios), a feat not seen before on a major animated film. The Friday-to-Friday drop was horrible (70%), and Saturday's was also bad (52%). Basically, if ***Dog Man***'s Sunday had a similar drop to last week, its second weekend drop would still be $15.41 million, which would mark a 58% drop. Even with the Super Bowl, the film should have dropped 50% at worst.

Through 10 days, the film has earned $54.2 million domestically. We predicted a $150 million domestic run, but that's just not feasible now. Depending on how it holds next week against ***Paddington in Peru***, there's a strong chance that ***Dog Man*** could finish with less than $100 million domestically, making it one of the most front-loaded animated films ever.

Sony's ***Heart Eyes*** debuted with $8.3 million in 3,102 theaters. That's much better than last year's ***Lisa Frankenstein*** ($3.8 million), another rom-com horror. It's not that far off from last month's ***Wolf Man*** ($10.8 million) either.

That's a solid start, especially considering the rom-com and horror combo does not have the bext track record at the box office (***Warm Bodies*** is a rare exception to the rule). In an attempt to boost the box office, Sony lifted the review embargo a week earlier and it paid off; it's currently at a pretty good 80% on RT. A sign that couples could show up.

According to Sony, it was equally split between men and women, and 63% was 25 and over. 40% of the audience were couples. They gave it a middling ""B–"" on CinemaScore, which isn't that bad for a horror title. It should hold well next week thanks to Valentine's Day, and it could finish with around $25 million domestically.

In third place, Universal's ***Love Hurts*** flopped with just $5.8 million in 3,055 theaters. That's a very poor start, managing to debut even below ***Nobody*** ($6.8 million), which was released in very bad conditions. 

The film was sold basically as a perfect antidote to the typical rom-com; how about adding action to the mix? While intriguing, the trailers offered solely action scenes without any interesting story in sight. The audience watches movies like this for the action scenes, but they still need an interesting story to come along. Ke Huy Quan made a comeback with ***Everything Everywhere All At Once***, but it's clear his name cannot open a movie. And neither can his co-star Ariana DeBose, who is coming off a huge string of critical and commercial duds. The reviews (18% on RT) were the final nail in the coffin.

According to Universal, 54% of the audience was male, and 50% was in the 18-34 demographic. The only thing that hurts more than those reviews is the audience's reviews: they gave it a poor ""C+"" on CinemaScore, which is a dead sentence for an action movie. With poor reception and competition on the way, the film is set to finish with less than $15 million domestically.

***Mufasa*** was barely affected by the Super Bowl. It eased just 36%, grossing $4 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $235.2 million.

***Companion*** fell all the way to fifth place, adding $3 million this weekend. That's a horrible 68% drop; even for Super Bowl weekends, that drop is larger-than-usual. Through 10 days, the film has earned $15.4 million, and it won't make it much further than $20 million domestically.

In sixth place, Sony's ***One of Them Days*** dropped 52%, earning $2.8 million. The film's domestic total stands at $39.2 million, and it should close with around $45 million domestically.

The documentary ***Becoming Led Zeppelin*** had an impressive debut, despite just playing in 369 theaters. It hit the seventh spot, earning $2.5 million this weekend. This made it the biggest IMAX debut for a concert film.

***Flight Risk*** dipped 53%, adding $2.5 million this weekend. The film has amassed $25.1 million and should finish with around $30 million domestically.

Paramount's ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** dropped 45%, for a $1.7 million weekend. The film has earned $233.1 million domestically.

***Moana 2*** rounded up the Top 10 with a 44% drop, adding $1.6 million. With this, the film has amassed $456.1 million.

Searchlight's ***A Complete Unknown*** is slowing down, after dropping 47% and adding $1.2 million this weekend. The film has earned $68 million so far.

Sony expanded Best Picture nominee ***I'm Still Here*** into 704 theaters, but the film made barely $1 million this weekend. The film has made $2.2 million so far.

Neon re-released Bong Joon-ho's ***Parasite*** in 193 screens. The film made $356,727, taking its lifetime total to $53.7 million domestically.

#**OVERSEAS**

Alright, the real deal is here. ***Ne Zha 2*** has crossed $1 billion in China alone. Not content with breaking so many opening weekend records, the film is now the highest grossing film in any country. And it's just getting started; it's projected to hit at least $1.5 billion, and could get close to $2 billion in China alone. Absolutely bonkers. Makes you wonder what ""impossible"" record can be broken next.

***Mufasa*** added $8.5 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $671 million. The best markets are France ($40.5M), the UK ($37.7M), Germany ($30.5M), Mexico ($30M) and Italy ($23.5M). 

***Paddington in Peru*** added $7.5 million this weekend, crossing $100 million overseas. It's hitting North America this weekend.

***Dog Man*** is failling to attract interest in the rest of the world. The film earned $6.6 million this weekend from 41 markets, taking its worldwide total to $66.2 million. Sounds good, except it isn't. $4 million of that money came from the UK, which means it flopped in pretty much every other market. It's clear this is gonna massively skew domestically.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Gladiator II* | Nov/22 | Paramount | $55,034,715 | $172,438,016 | $461,598,753 | $250M

- 24 years in the making, ***Gladiator II*** has closed with $461.5 million worldwide. The fact that it's slightly above the original ***Gladiator*** is impressive. Less impressive is that its budget was $250 million, putting the break-even point far higher. Despite middling audience response, the film still held well enough, finishing with a 3.13x multiplier. Definitely a flop, but you can't say it didn't go out without a fight.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

Marvel is back in theaters.

The film is ***Captain America: Brave New World***, the 35th film in the MCU, and the first with Anthony Mackie as Captain America. To boost the film, Marvel got Harrison Ford attached as Thaddeus Ross, who transforms into Red Hulk. Despite some bad press over the past years, the film has launched a successful marketing campaign and pre-sales are looking good as of now. The only question left is if the film will deliver quality.

It's Valentine's Day weekend, and there's a British icon returning to the big screens. That's ***Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy***, the fourth installment. This franchise has been the most profitable rom-com ever, with all films accumulating to $756 million worldwide. It's gonna make a killing in theaters... except in North America. As the franchise has lost power in the country (the third film made just 11.4% of its money in North America), Universal has decided to send the film to Peacock instead. But this is a very powerful franchise that it can survive this.

gladiator,gladiator movie,1ih2g3o,"January 31-February 2 Box Office Recap: 'Dog Man' debuts with a pretty great $36 million domestically, marking DreamWorks' 26th film to hit #1. Meanwhile, 'Companion' opens in second place with a very solid $9.3 million domestically.","https://preview.redd.it/4xbb33mt50he1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f895ae7b62d34771b5e8e35a9e00fcd75e3fb76

And so, DreamWorks' winning streak continued. After a very weak January, ***Dog Man*** arrived with a bang, delivering the second highest January debut for an animated title. WB's ***Companion*** had to settle for second place, although it still finished with a solid debut.

The Top 10 earned a combined $74.9 million this weekend. That's up a massive 45% from last year, when ***Argylle*** embarrassed itself with its failure.

Debuting in first place, DreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** earned $36 million in 3,885 theaters. That's the second best January debut for an animated title, behind DreamWorks' own ***Kung Fu Panda 3*** ($41.8 million) and marks the studio's third consecutive #1 title.

The film's success is not entirely surprising. The books from which it is based on have proven to be very popular with kids and families, allowing it to build an audience ready for the film. Another advantage was that it was the first animated film (get out of the way ***Mufasa***) since ***Moana 2***, so families were starving for a new film. Reviews were also good enough (78% on RT) to convince those skeptical in giving it a chance.

According to Universal, 52% of the audience was male and 58% of the audience was under 25. They gave it a strong ""A"" on CinemaScore, signaling some great word of mouth. The film won't face much animated competition (that ***Looney Tunes*** movie is distributed by a very small distributor), so this could hold well. For now, a $150 million domestic run is likely.

Debuting in second place, Warner Bros.'s ***Companion*** earned $9.3 million this weekend. That's not that far off from ***Barbarian*** ($10.5 million), which is another title from producer Zach Cregger. Not bad at all considering this just $10 million.

It's tough to ask for much better numbers for a film like this. WB spent low on the marketing front; just $29 million went to the marketing campaign. They hoped that the trailers emphasizing an interesting concept would perform similarly to ***Barbarian***, hoping the audience would be surprised by the twists (well, most of them). While Sophie Thatcher and Jack Quaid are known names, they still aren't box office draws by themselves. WB gave a final push for the film by lifting the embargo earlier than usual, and it looks like it worked; it's currently at a great 94% on RT.

According to WB, 51% of the audience was male, and 68% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is very solid for a thriller like this. The film should hold well in the coming weeks, although it's unlikely it can match the domestic total of ***Barbarian*** ($40.8 million).

In third place, Disney's ***Mufasa: The Lion King*** eased just 27% this weekend, grossing $6.3 million. The film has earned $229.6 million so far, and it should finish with $250 million lifetime.

In fourth place, Sony's ***One of Them Days*** also eased just 27%, adding $5.8 million. The film has earned $34.3 million, and it will finish with over $45 million domestically.

Last week's champ ***Flight Risk*** descended 53%, adding $5.4 million this weekend. Considering the horrible reception, that's not really a bad drop. Through 10 days, the film has earned $20.7 million, and it looks like it will finish with close to $30 million by the end of its run.

***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** eased 39%, adding $3.2 million. That takes its domestic total to $230.5 million.

In seventh place, Disney's ***Moana 2*** dipped 32%, earning $2.8 this weekend. The film has amassed $453.9 million so far.

Searchlight's ***A Complete Unknown*** had the best hold in the Top 10. It eased a light 25%, grossing $2.3 million. With this, the film has earned $66.8 million, becoming one of the studio's highest grossing films.

A24's ***The Brutalist*** added 494 theaters this weekend. With this, it eased 30%, adding $1.8 million. The film has earned $12.1 million so far.

Rounding up the Top 10 was ***Den of Thieves 2: Pantera***, which dropped 47% and adding $1.5 million this weekend. With this, the film has amassed $34.4 million.

Neon's ***Presence*** collapsed 61% on its second weekend, earning just $1.3 million. The film has earned $5.8 million so far, and it's not gonna make it to $8 million domestically.

The Chinese film ***Creation of the Gods II: Demon Force*** debuted in 200 theaters, but it earned a pretty good $1.2 million.

Universal/Blumhouse's ***Wolf Man*** lost 1,313 theaters on its third weekend, further adding salt to the wound. The film fell 65%, adding $1.1 million this weekend. Through 3 weeks, the film has earned just $19.9 million, and it should finish with around $22 million domestically.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Mufasa*** once again led the overseas box office, earning $11.7 million, taking its worldwide total to $653 million. The best markets are France ($39.5M), the UK ($36.6M), Germany ($29.3M), Mexico ($29.1M) and Italy ($23.4M).

***Paddington in Peru*** added $8.7 million this weekend, for an early $93.2 million overseas run. 

***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** added $7 million, for a $462.5 million worldwide run. With this, it has officially passed ***Pokémon: Detective Pikachu*** for the second highest grossing video game movie. The best markets are the UK ($30.1M), Mexico ($21.7M), France ($19M), Australia ($18.2M) and Brazil ($12.9M).

***Companion*** debuted in 60 countries, although it earned a soft $5.3 million, for a $14.6 million worldwide debut. It had weak debuts in the UK ($900K), France ($700K) and Mexico ($500K), indicating this is gonna be a domestic heavy film.

While ***Dog Man*** was strong in North America, the same cannot be said for its overseas prospects. It debuted in 29 countries, but it earned just $4.2 million, which translates to a $40.4 million worldwide debut. It had a modest start in Spain ($1.1M), while it was very weak in Mexico ($700K) and Italy ($600K). Looks like it will be the rare DreamWorks film to skew higher on the domestic side.

After two months in theaters, ***Gladiator II*** added $450,000 this weekend in the remaining overseas markets. And with this, it has now eclipsed $461.3 million worldwide, finally passing the original ***Gladiator*** ($460.5 million). If only that budget didn't get out of control.

- DreamWorks' ***The Wild Robot*** has closed with a damn great $326 million worldwide. The film has held very well, achieving the 4x multiplier. It's a big win for DreamWorks, on top of achieving some of its best reviews in their history. They recently announced a sequel is in development, we'll keep an eye on that one.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

The Super Bowl weekend is known to be one of the slowest weekends ever. People prepare to meet up and watch the game (with last year's game being watched by a colossal 123 million viewers, the most watched event in US history), so studios avoid releasing anything big here.

Universal is releasing the action comedy ***Love Hurts***, which stars Ke Huy Quan as a realtor whose past as a violent hitman comes back to haunt him. The marketing emphasizes the action element, while also highlighting that it comes from the producers of ***Nobody*** and ***Violent Night***, both of which were very successful. While it won't take the top spot from ***Dog Man***, perhaps ***Love Hurts*** could surprise.

Sony is also releasing the slasher comedy ***Heart Eyes***, which follows co-workers working late on Valentine's Day who are mistaken for a couple by the infamous Heart Eyes Killer. The horror comedy combo is hit-and-miss at the box office, so Sony wanted to give the film a chance by lifting the review embargo one week early, and the reviews are quite good so far.

6. The Rookie- Clint Eastwood, Charlie Sheen, Raul Julia cop movie vs. Dennis Quad baseball biopic. 

7. Man of the House- Chevy Chase comedy with JTT vs Tommy Lee Jones comedy.

8. Bad Company- Sexy spy thriller with Lawrence Fishbourne and Ellen Barkin vs. Chris Rock CIA comedy.

9. Crash- Controversial James Spader movie about car crash fetiches vs Controversial Oscar-winner about racism. 

10. Hot Pursuit- 80s John Cusack comedy with Ben Stiller and his father Jerry as villains vs. Reese Witherspoon/Sonia Vergara comedy.

*Not a major release but a movie I really loved as a kid.

gladiator,gladiator movie,1i6ux98,What's the worst movie script you read?,"From what I heard and seen, Nick Cave's Gladiator II script sounded kinda of weird. Maximus going to Heaven, then gets revenge, then at the end of the screenplay, he lives to the modern-day. I say this, Gladiator didn't need a sequel at all, the ending wrapped up perfectly and all loose ends were tied. And Cave knew that Russell Crowe wasn't going to like the script at all, then the script was rejected and scrapped after Steven Spielberg, who had consulted on the original film, told Ridley Scott it wasn't going to work, especially as Cave had written something ""too grand"" due to his theatre work.

I haven't seen the actual Gladiator II and probably never will because of how the first one was so good but I didn't hear good things at all. However, Nick Cave's screenplay wasn't used at all for the real Gladiator II so it was never made.

Then we have the Elf 2 screenplay, I read a few parts of the script a few years back (I don't remember it that well) but it seemed like that it wasn't all that good and interesting. There's a reason why Will Ferrell turned down a huge paycheck to respire his role as Buddy the Elf and even I also think that Elf didn't really need a sequel as it all wrapped up perfectly. I can say that Elf is a classic but no sequel was needed because of how well it wrapped up.

There are tons of more of bad screenplays out there but the two are prime examples of the worst movie scripts I have read.",0,24,1737497579.0,2025-01-21 22:12:59,False

I mean just look at 2007..!

However, I suspect if you pick any 10-year span in modern movie history you can come up with a similarly impressive list?

On the contrary – it was also the golden age of CGI and brought two of the most successful film franchises in history – Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter – to the screen.

gladiator,gladiator movie,1i0w6jg,"January 10-12 Box Office Recap: 'Den of Thieves 2' takes the #1 spot from 'Mufasa' and 'Sonic', debuting with $15 million domestically. However, 'Better Man' massively flopped in its wide expansion, debuting at #13 with a terrible $1 million from 1,291 theaters, against its $110 million budget.","https://preview.redd.it/wyyfpflzhvce1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e6b820d9a6c3bcf91bab0d1448e8d898d5716f5

Turns out the kingdom didn't last long.

Whether it was a surprise or not, ***Den of Thieves 2: Pantera*** managed to dethrone ***Mufasa: The Lion King*** for the top spot at the box office. In some very bad news, the wide expansion of ***Better Man*** was a complete disaster, finishing outside the Top 10.

The Top 10 earned a combined $69.6 million this weekend. That's down 16.8% from last year, when ***Mean Girls*** and ***The Beekeeper*** opened. Despite the current LA fires, the LA market still accounted for 8% of the weekend's gross, which is actually above the usual 7.9% in a normal weekend.

Debuting at #1, ***Den of Thieves 2: Pantera*** earned $15 million in 3,008 theaters. That's almost on par with the original ***Den of Thieves*** ($15.2 million). It's also the first Lionsgate film to hit #1 at the box office since ***The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes*** in 2023 (they've had a very bad run last year).

Even though it arrived 7 years later, clearly the interest was there for a ***Den of Thieves*** sequel. Compared to a lot of recent actions flicks with Gerard Butler, it has maintained that popularity thanks to home media and streaming. But these films corner the exact same market: the dad movie market. There's an audience who simply wants to watch an old-school action movie, and ***Den of Thieves*** delivers that (just like ***The Beekeeper*** did one year ago). The LA fires also didn't do much impact in its box office numbers; the LA market generated 10.4% of the film's box office, which is actually bigger than the original's 9.3% LA share.

According to Lionsgate, 63% of the audience was male. As mentioned, this was a dad movie; 79% of the audience was 25 and over, with 52% over 35. They gave it a ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is the same grade as the original. January looks quite weak, although it will have to compete with stuff like ***Wolf Man*** and ***Flight Risk*** in a few weeks. Nevertheless, it has enough gas to hit $40 million domestically.

The reign of ***Mufasa*** lasted just one weekend, as it had to go back to the second spot. The film dropped 39.4%, adding $14.2 million this weekend. The film has earned $188.7 million, which is a colossal 61% behind the 2019 film through the same point.

In third place, ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** dropped 46.8%, adding $11.3 million. With this, it has not only passed the second film's gross, but it also passed the $200 million milestone. It has earned $204.8 million so far, and it should finish with around $240 million domestically.

In fourth place, Focus Features' ***Nosferatu*** dropped 47.3%, adding $6.8 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to a fantastic $81.8 million, and it's still on pace to finish with over $100 million, assuming it's not killed by ***Wolf Man*** this weekend.

***Moana 2*** fell back to Earth after its holiday boost. It dropped 47.5%, earning $6.5 million this weekend. The film has amassed $434.8 million domestically.

Searchlight's ***A Complete Unknown*** eased 37.4%, adding $5.1 million this weekend. With this, the film has crossed $50 million domestically, although the dream of $100 million died.

***Wicked*** had a slightly rough drop. This time, it fell 48.7%, grossing $5.1 million this weekend. Nevertheless, it's not like Universal ain't hurtin'; the film has made $70 million in PVOD in its first week. The film has earned a fantastic $458 million so far.

In eighth place, A24's ***Babygirl*** is still holding very well despite the end of the holidays. The film eased just 30.6% (the best drop in the top 10), adding $3 million this weekend. The film has earned a damn good $21.7 million so far.

In ninth place, the Indian film ***Game Changer*** earned $2 million from just 805 theaters.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Roadside Attractions' ***The Last Showgirl***, which finally had its wide release after having a limited weekend run at a single theater last month. It debuted with a solid $1.5 million in 870 theaters. While it's set to expand it in to a few more theaters, don't expect it to hit $10 million.

A24 expanded ***The Brutalist*** to 68 theaters, coming off its big wins at the Golden Globes last week. The film grossed a pretty great $1.3 million, which is a very strong $20,408 per-theater average. So far, the film has earned $2.7 million. It will see another expansion this weekend, before finally hitting wide release the following weekend.

***Gladiator II*** fell 53.4%, adding $1.2 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $170.9 million.

We have to go all the way to the #13 spot to find the weekend's other expansion, Paramount's ***Better Man***, the Robbie Williams biopic. We knew it was not gonna break out, given that its limited release numbers were very poor. Yet the film managed to surprise us by going even lower.

***Better Man*** debuted in 1,291 theaters, and the film earned a terrible $1 million. Yep, you read that correctly. That's an anemic $824 per-theater average. Assuming that each theater played this five times a day at a regular $11.90 ticket price, that means that there were just 4 people in each screening. Woah. And to make things worse, the film cost $110 million. Now, Paramount is not deeply invested in here; they only picked the distribution rights to the film for $25 million. They won't lose a lot of money, but this will be another money loss for them.

The American market was never going crazy for a Robbie Williams biopic for a simple reason: they have no idea who Robbie Williams is. That's quite surprising, given that he's the one of the best-selling singers in history (75 million records sold puts him in the same vein as The Weeknd, Green Day, Oasis, Nirvana and Imagine Dragons). But despite his popularity across Europe, Oceania and Latin America, Williams never broke out in America. Only two of his songs made it in the Billboard Top 100 (""Angels"" and ""Millennium"") and they both peaked at #53 and #72. So despite selling out a lot of concerts and records, he's still a complete unknown in America.

There's also the decision that was supposed to be its selling point, but still drew a polarizing reaction. To separate itself from other biopics, the film decided to depict Williams as a CGI chimpanzee. Bonus points for originality, but that also confused the general audience. So the audience are left with two questions ""who is Robbie Williams?"" and ""why is he a chimpanzee?"" Instead of trying to find more or listen to a few songs from Williams, they simply chose to not watch it all. After all, a music biopic is aimed at big fans of a singer, so why would they pay for an artist they don't care about? Even with great reviews (88% on RT and 77 on Metacritic), that's not enough to make them change their mind.

According to Paramount, 56% of the audience was male, and 52% was 25 and over. Despite some great word of mouth (83% on PostTrak, 63% definite recommend), this is not a film that will leg out. It's not gonna hit $5 million domestically, and it's likely it could miss $3 million as well. We want to say it will be saved overseas, but the film has been disappointing in the UK and Australia so far. This is a flop.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Mufasa: The Lion King*** topped the box office with $27.8 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $542 million. The film's best markets are France ($33.7M), UK ($29.9M), Mexico ($24.6M), Germany ($24M) and Italy ($21.8M).

***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** added $20.3 million, as it's nearing $400 million worldwide. Most notably, it opened in China, where it flopped with only a little over $1 million. The film's best markets are UK ($25.9M), Mexico ($18.8M), France ($15.8M), Australia ($13.2M) and Brazil ($9.2M).

***Nosferatu*** added $13.7 million, taking its worldwide total to a fantastic $135.4 million. It's Robert Egger's highest grossing film by a wide margin, passing ***The Northman*** a long time ago. The best markets are the UK ($11.1M), Mexico ($6.03M), Italy ($4.3M), Germany ($3.5M) and Australia ($3.4M).

***Moana*** added $11.1 million, helping it reach $990 million worldwide. The film's best markets are France ($60.6M), UK ($49.7M), Germany ($41.7M), Mexico ($30.2M) and Australia ($29.5M). It's hitting the billion milestone sometime this week.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Venom: The Last Dance* | Oct/25 | Sony | $51,012,404 | $139,755,882 | $474,775,261 | $120M
*Y2K* | Dec/6 | A24 | $2,113,923 | $3,763,863 | $3,763,863 | $15M

- Sony's ***Venom: The Last Dance*** has closed with $474 million worldwide. Despite its poor reception and word of mouth (""B–"" on CinemaScore), the film benefitted from a lack of competition, as studios chose to avoid releasing anything close to the election. A success? Definitely. But the film still ended up making less money than ***Let There Be Carnage***, which was released in worse conditions and had no China grosses. Who knows what's the future for this character.

- A24's ***Y2K*** has closed with a very poor $3.7 million in North America, which is a very bad 1.78x multiplier. Despite Kyle Mooney's interest in filmmaking, the film struggled to balance its horror and comedy elements, but at the end of the day, the audience simply wasn't interested. Let's hope his next film is much better, if he ever gets the chance.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We find two newcomers this weekend.

The first, and perhaps the weekend's winner, is Universal/Blumhouse's ***Wolf Man***. The film is the latest addition in Universal's reboot of their Classic Monsters line-up, after the success of ***The Invisible Man*** (also written and directed by Leigh Whannell). Horror is a very reliable genre, so perhaps we might be looking at another winner here.

The other wide release is Sony's ***One of Them Days***, which stars Keke Palmer and SZA as two friends who seek to avoid eviction. In the current landscape, there's been very few comedies not tied to IPS, so this can be a good test to see the interest in R-rated comedies.

#**ANNOUNCEMENT**

As this weekend falls on the MLK weekend, the actuals will probably be delayed by a day. So the post will go up on Tuesday.

gladiator,gladiator movie,1hzt7h8,Adam Driver collects great directors like Pokemon,"It's pretty clear to me that Driver's philosophy is that if he works with amazing directors, he's going to improve his chances of being in great movies and improve his craft.  While it doesn't always work out and he sometimes has small roles, for the most part it does seem to pay off.  Driver's average movie score on Metacritic is 70/100 with movies like Baumbach's ""Marriage Story"" (94/100), Coen Brothers' ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" (93/100), Jarmush's ""Paterson"" (90/100) and Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" (87/100) at the top.

Other than Daniel Day Lewis (76/100), you'd struggle to find other actors with average metacritic scores as high as Driver.  For example,  Dicaprio (64/100), Cruise (62/100), Frances McDormand (67/100), Joaquin Phoenix (63/100), Denzel (64/100), Hanks (62/100).

**Additional Thoughts**

* **Flops:** It's interesting that some of the biggest duds Driver has been involved in also happen to be from some of the greatest directors past their prime.  Coppolla's ""Megalopolis"", Gilliam's ""Man who Killed Don Quixote"", Ridley Scott's ""House of Gucci"" a few examples, but if the idea is to soak up everything you can from the greatest to ever do it, your opportunities to work with legends in their mid-80s are limited.
* **Future Targets:**  I imagine there certain consistently panned directors, like Zack Snyder (average metacritic score in the 40s with peak being 59/100), that he'd want to avoid, but I'd take a wild guess that Driver's agent has an open call to directors like Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, Denis Villenueve, etc that's like ""Hey... my boy is ready when you are"".  Who do you guess is at the top of his wish list?
* **Driver a Future Director?:** I don't know if he's ever expressed an interest in making his own projects, but it would be difficult to find someone who has worked on films with that many incredible directors.  You have to imagine he's learned a lot.  That's like the world's greatest filmmaking masterclass.  He kinda owes it to everyone to give directing a shot at some point.",1114,270,1736706436.0,2025-01-12 18:27:16,False
gladiator,gladiator movie,1hzm4ko,Movies you thought you would enjoy but couldn’t even finish?,"I recently went to see Gladiator 2, fully expecting to just enjoy it. Sure it might not be my favourite movie of the year, but to my sincere surprise I was just so *bored* during it, that I did something which I have rarely ever done in my entire life and I just got up and left. Not out of anger or any kind of extreme emotion, but I was just so uninterested and underwhelmed that without even thinking I just found myself causally get up and leave to go do something else.

Anyone else have any movies they interested in, or even hyped to see, only to find them surprisingly disappointing or underwhelming? ",902,2492,1736686726.0,2025-01-12 12:58:46,False

I always respected the movies which had a great special effects and appriciated them highly. I feel that there are some movies that surpassed its time or had GREAT special effects and I guess everyone has such a list. For me it is:

* Star Wars (surpassed its time) 

* Terminator 2/Aliens/Jurrassic Park (surpassed)

gladiator,gladiator movie,1hy7ttn,Baby Driver is literally a perfect action movie.(for me),"I chose to watch it last night in no seriousness whatsoever after getting disgusted by some Kevin Hart shitty supposedly ""sky heist"" movie and, voila!

 Don't know how to explain this but to keep thinking that if you're gonna make the action movie in these modern days, you HAVE TO make em this way.

 Fast pased, but butter smooth. Every characters and dialogues, filled with the best of the best they can offer till the very last drop. Focus of the movie, (which, in this case, happens to be car chasing, music, literal movie-like love, crime and punishment), spot-on. Nailed. Music is just one greatness of this movie. 

No lies, this has been positioned now as one of the 6 movies that got 2 thumbs up from me on Netflix, rest of them being Godfather, Irishman, Oldboy, Pulp Fiction, All quiets. Now if you really want to go as deep as talking about pure quality of a content, then those 7 names would of course not necesseraily be on the same level. But all of their makers did their best in each of their times, genres, or realms and that's all matters in my opinion. Caption just means this not that its the greatest movie of all time.

If you are willing to share your great finds on Netflix like this film of mine(sorry if this is already greatly well-credited film, I didn't even know existance of this til last night), then please do in the comments.

Also, I list here my dissapointment of films on Netflix to make it easy for you to recommend more preferable ones for me.

-Top Gun Maverick

gladiator,gladiator movie,1hxbdxv,The Northman (2022) is one of the best-made action blockbusters of the century.,"_Spoilers Ahead_

I just watched it and I'm absolutely fucking blown away. I've now seen all of Robert Eggers' films, and despite his incredible, pioneering work in the horror genre, this surprisingly may well be my favorite movie of his.

The Northman is the rare ""auteurist blockbuster"" - massive in scale and scope, full of bombastic, big-budget setpieces and genre thrills, and yet not a whiff of commercial pressure or creative compromise to be found. Every frame of this movie feels bespoke, intentional, and dripping in Eggers' style.

Despite having seen all of Eggers' work, the one movie I reflexively associate with him is The Lighthouse, a famously confounding work that defies categorization and keeps the viewer at something of an emotional remove the entire time. With this in mind, the most pleasant surprise of The Northman for me was that despite its unrelenting ruthlessness, and its refreshing refusal to collapse its story into a moral binary, it was still full of deep pathos and an unexpected tenderness that I'm not accustomed to with Eggers. There was a genuinely uplifting, even thrilling quality to the love story (and team-up) with Anya Taylor-Joy's character in the second half that I really didn't expect to feel as resonant as it did.

To go along with this, the movie is absolutely shot through with beauty, more so than any of Eggers' work. The first half manages to keep finding artful, visually arresting ways to frame the ugliest of violence, whereas the second half transforms into a visual love letter to the incomprehensibly beautiful vistas of Iceland. This movie really does have some of the best cinematography I've seen, especially for its genre. (Particularly creative and beautiful were the many scenes set under moonlight, so desaturated as to almost look black and white - that is until a burst of vivid color, usually from a fire, cuts through the monochromatic palette to give us images that look straight from a painting or a comic book. Nosferatu makes extensive use of this look, to similarly gorgeous results.)

Every single performance in this movie blew me away. I'm convinced Alexander Skarsgard is an actual fucking animal wearing human skin - the amount of ferocious physicality he brings to all his roles is a wonder to watch, and he really outdid himself here. (At the same time, the way he charts Amleth's shift from hardened warrior to a sudden vulnerability after he meets Olga - as if the character himself is discovering those emotions for the first time - is beautifully convincing.) Claes Bang, who I recently saw excel at playing a loathsome scumbag in Apple TV's Bad Sisters, is just as brilliant as Fjolnir, a surprisingly more gray and even partially sympathetic character than the film initially lets on. Anya Taylor-Joy brings magnetism and warmth to a character that easily could've been a cliche, convincing me that Amleth would really fall for her, so far as to question his own fate.

And Nicole Kidman, holy fuck. After not having much screentime for most of the movie, she absolutely lets her fangs loose in that twisted, harrowing reunion with Amleth, matching Skarsgard in raw power. The two did career-best work playing husband and wife in the excellent Big Little Lies, and the way Kidman inhabits the other side of that abusive dynamic here as his mother (while also, startlingly, carrying forward the sexual element) was really something to behold.

I also caught a couple of funny meta-connections. Claes Bang previously played Dracula in a Netflix series, whereas Eggers went onto to make Nosferatu. And best of all, Hafthor Bjornsson (aka The Mountain from GOT) shows up as the guy Amleth bests in the ball game, and Amleth kills him in a very similar way to how The Mountain famously killed Oberyn in GOT, basically getting some extra-textual revenge. (I swear I even recognized one or two bits of the Icelandic landscape here from GOT.)

I think overall this movie deserves to go down in history as one of the best action epic ever made, on par with Gladiator, the Dune films, and Nolan's work. Really a labor of love, made with more care and craft than most blockbusters nowadays.",0,40,1736424521.0,2025-01-09 12:08:41,False

gladiator,gladiator movie,1hvnuw4,My ranking of 2024! ,"I’m going by U.K. release dates, it’s just easier for me and it means I don’t spend the first two months of the year adding movies to my previous year’s lists 

1. The Zone of Interest – One of the most powerful movies I’ve ever seen. Such a simple concept, but so impactful, putting you directly into the shoes of evil in a way that leaves you so unsettled even as the end credits roll. And obviously the sound design is absolutely fantastic, but the visuals and filming style also leave a massive impact. 
2. Challengers – So well structured and tightly plotted, the relationship development and the drama was so good and the end was especially unforgettable. 

3. The Wild Robot – Such a beautiful story of love and nature and community and found family, with absolutely stunning animation. 
4. Conclave – From the stunning cinematography and the colours to the political machinations of the conclave itself, everything about this movie is so tightly done. Explores so much and it never feels like a theme or plot line is under explored or skipped over. The politics unfolds perfectly and it leaves you with so many ideas to think about. And, although everyone in the movie is great, Ralph Fiennes especially has to get best lead actor for this! 
5. All Of Us Strangers – A powerful story about grief and loneliness which lingers long after the end credits and Paul Mescal and Andrew Scott are both wonderful in it. 
6. Wicked – One of my all time favourite musicals and the incredibly long wait was so worth it! An adaptation that retained everything great about the original show, with a stellar cast, brilliant choreography and just enough expansion to round out the plot for the big screen. 
7. His Three Daughters – A deeply emotional and heartfelt portrayal of grief and family, with highly affecting performances from the three leads, and very cleverly directed. 
8. Daughters – An incredibly moving and powerful must watch documentary, about an incredible program, which allows incarcerated fathers to have a father daughter dance with their daughters. It’s also immaculately directed by Angela Patton and Natalie  Rae and they do such a good job at weaving so many stories together, while simultaneously deftly exploring the deeper issues at play within the US prison system. 
9. Lisa Frankenstein – Totally weird and unique in the best way possible, very darkly funny, great set design and costuming and a very fun plot overall. Feels like a Heathers-esque future cult classic. 
10. Wicked Little Letters – fantastic writing and dialogue, really funny, brilliant performances and I loved that it was a true story 
11. One Life – A beautiful true story and it made me cry. 
12. The End We Start From – A story of hope, resilience and survival in hard times, with a great lead performance from Jodi Comer. 
13. American Fiction – a very funny, biting and incredibly well written satire, which effortlessly explores many complex themes, whilst also functioning very effectively as a comedy at the same time. 
14. My Old Ass – A really funny and surprisingly emotional examination 
15. The Outrun – A wonderful performance from Saiorse Ronan, a story about addiction, crashing and rising back up and I loved how cyclical, dreamy and hazy the whole thing felt. The cinematography and locations also stunning. 
16. Seize Them — Absolutely hilarious, very well written and a 10/10 cast. 
17. The Bikeriders – An epic and well told deconstruction of biker culture, which maintains multiple stories at once and does all of them justice, while also telling a very interesting and tragic true story
18. Wallace and Gromit: Vengance Most Fowl – A wonderful comeback for one of the best animated franchises of all time. Witty, so many funny details, a great commentary on AI and it was just lovely to have Wallace and Gromit back on Christmas Day. 
19. Better Man – A bold, original, creative and very emotionally compelling biopic with a great soundtrack 
20. Snack Shack – A warm, witty, nostalgic, summery and overall very  funny portrayal of teenage life
21. The Fall Guy – A great surprise and a fantastic tribute to stunt people. Very funny, meta, emotionally impactful and it had a great love story. 
22. Woman of The Hour – this manages to be a fantastic portrayal of a real life story, an exploration of the dangers women face even today and a really tightly made thriller. A fantastic directorial debut for Anna Kendrick, who also does a great job in the lead role. 
23. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice – One of my biggest pleasant surprises of the year. So fun and funny! Just a great, creative, madcap adventure. And I loved the use of practical effects. 
24. Dune Part 2 – Epic, incredible cinematography, great performances and much more tightly plotted than the first film. 
25. We Live In Time – Warm, funny and heartbreaking at the same time. And I loved seeing Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh together. 
26. The Color Purple – A big, bright, colourful, unapologetic musical, with a classic empowering and beautiful story of a woman who goes through so much and finds her identity with the support of other women. 
27. Kneecap – As funny as it is dynamically filmed, it also has some great deeper messages at play. 
28. The Holdovers – Another cozy and funny Christmas movie, with a strong emotional core and great character development. 
29. That Christmas – A very heartwarming, funny and cozy Christmas film. 
30. Monkey Man – A well paced, well directed and emotional action thriller.  
31. Blitz – A great snapshot of a fascinating moment in history, with great cinematography and a really epic feel overall. I also really enjoyed the way that George was able to explore and examine his identity as a mixed race child in England at this time. Although the blitz is so covered as a historical period, this really did feel like a fresh perspective. 
32. The Piano Lesson – a classic play, well built tension and a stellar cast. 
33. Gladiator 2 – Not a massively strong plot, but epic, stunningly shot and highly enjoyable overall. 
34. Joy – A heartwarming portrayal of an important story and a lovely tribute to its characters. 
35. Jim Henson: Idea Man – A loving, informative and creatively made tribute to an incredible man with an incredible life. 
36. Young Woman and the Sea – A very interesting biopic with some stunning cinematography. 
37. Love Lies Bleeding – A really tense and well made crime thriller, with good performances and an interesting critique on toxic and abusive relationships.
38. Civil War – A really pleasant surprise and not what I expected at all. A biting and fascinating exploration of the ethics of war reporting and photojournalism. The only reason it’s not much higher is that (and I do understand what they were trying to do with it tbf), I felt the vagueness of the conflict with clues hidden here and there distracted a bit from what the film was trying to say and explore overall. 
39. Anora – Overall, Anora is a fascinating, funny and moving character and trope de-construction. The only reason it’s not much higher on my list is that the middle drags a bit and the dialogue is pretty repetitive at times. 
40. Fancy Dance – A moving film with an especially good performance from Lily Gladstone, exploring issues faced by indigenous families to great emotional impact. But I did think it ended a bit abruptly without much resolution. 
41. The Critic – An intriguing murder mystery with lots of twists and turns, as well as great performances, especially from Ian Mckellen. 
42. Paddington in Peru – Not as good as the first two Paddington films, but still a fun and funny adventure that’s well worth a watch. 
43. Moana 2 – stunning animation and an enjoyable plot. The only three things that drag it down a bit for me: the music isn’t nearly as good as the first one and the fact that you can hear that it’s an attempt to mimic LMM’s music from the first movie made it worse. The villains were pretty weak. And without spoiling it too much I wasn’t a big fan of certain things that happen to Moana at the end. 
44. Lee – A really interesting insight into someone with an extraordinary life. Kate Winslet and Andy Samberg were great in it too. 
45. Carry On – A tense and enjoyable thriller that builds up its plot well. Not a masterpiece, but a really fun afternoons’ watch. 
46. Bad Tidings – A great Christmas comedy with two of my favourite comedians.
47. Rob Peace – A lovely tribute to someone with a tragic life.
48. Deadpool and Wolverine – funny with a very clever meta narrative and a great use of music. I didn’t like the first Deadpool that much and I skipped the second one, but this is absolutely the strongest of the trilogy.
49. Bob Marley: One Love – A really interesting insight into an icon. 
50. Inside Out 2 – As funny, clever and emotionally effective as the last film. But it just gave me everything I liked about the first film and didn’t really push the boundaries of the Inside Out world in the way that it could have and that I hoped it would. 
51. Suncoast – An emotionally affecting film with great performances. Nico Parker is especially great, but Woody Harrelson’s character feels a bit pointless and the mum is pretty terrible. 
52. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire – A fun and funny addition to an iconic for a reason franchise. 
53. Turtles All The Way Down – A cute teen film with an especially effective portrayal of the mental health side of the story. But some of the subplots did feel a bit bizarre and unecessary with not so great execution. 
54. Mother’s Instinct – a fairly standard slightly soapy thriller with good performances that builds tension well. 
55. Shirley – An interesting story, but not told in an overly exciting way. 
56. Fly Me To The Moon – A sweet and entertaining love story that just dragged a bit too much towards the end for me. 
57. Mean Girls – I had fun with this especially as a musical theatre fan. The music from the Broadway show is good, it was funny and the performances were enjoyable. But it was a bit dragged down by some of the adaptation choices, mainly in the music. It felt like they were ashamed that it was a musical and that they kept trying to de-Broadway the songs to make it “cool”, which I didn’t feel was necessary. 
58. Spaceman – An interesting and surprisingly emotional concept, even if it was a bit strange. 
59. Kinds Of Kindness – great cast and interesting thematic links between the three stories, but I felt it went on a bit too long in the end. 
60. Find Me Falling – just a bland Netflix romance. Not the worst thing I’ve ever seen but not great either. 
61. Damsel – although it was very generic girl power and wasn’t the best quality overall, the action was entertaining and I did find the plot engaging. 
62. The Garfield Movie – This was cute and fairly entertaining for what it was, but didn’t go beyond that for me. 
63. Drive Away Dolls – This had some potential as a witty crime caper, but the plot felt thin, rushed and underdeveloped for me. 
64. The Hit Man – I get that the characters being terrible was kind of the point, but I didn’t find them or the film as a whole very engaging. 
65. A Different Man – I felt like this had so much potential in the beginning, but once the post change stuff started I didn’t really understand what it was trying to say, other than saying that the struggles we saw throughout the entire first half was just because of his attitude, which is a terrible message if that was the intention. 
66. Back To Black – the actress playing Amy Winehouse did a decent job, but it focused way too much on her personal life and not nearly enough on her music and felt like it didn’t do her justice overall. 
67. Emilia Pérez – A not too bad idea executed in the most bizarre and jarring way possible. 
68. The Persian Version – I was excited for this one from the trailer, but it felt like the director wanted to tell so many different stories and couldn’t effectively concentrate on any of them. 
69. A Family Affair – Started off kind of funny at the very beginning with Zack Efron playing a big headed movie star, but the plot got very strange and terrible very quickly. 
70. Despicable Me 4 – As someone who honestly loved the first Despicable Me, it’s been so sad to see all the heart slowly sapped out of the franchise, with this nothing of a film being the end result. It’s funny in some places, but there’s so little plot, heart and character development that it’s honestly depressing. All the characters and situations are just a vehicle for comedy, with nothing else added in, leaving the whole thing feeling empty overall. ",3,12,1736242517.0,2025-01-07 09:35:17,False

gladiator,gladiator movie,1hrdoo0,2024 is such the weird year of movies.,"There’s have been a writer strike and got ended last 2023. Many films got delayed including MCU movies. Dune Pt 2 is the best and popular film last year. Challengers is also so good. Conclave as well that I didn’t expect it that is a PG Rated film. Wicked is the best musical of 2024 I’ve ever seen. Fall Guy was underrated but peak cinema. Furiosa is great and some best film but a box office bomb. There’s isn’t many Comic book movies releasing in 2024 and they most failed except for Deadpool and Wolverine(extremely peak cinema). Joker Folie à Deux is the most anticipated film of 2024 and they just failed as a sequel musical. Animated films are alright with The Wild Robot and Inside Out 2 except with Moana 2(I haven’t seen it yet).  Kung Fu Panda 4 is good and mid(not as good first 2 or 3) Despicable Me 4 is very mid and leads to box office success. Flow is very interesting. Transformers One is so great and good but not sure why it’s a box office failure. Much spinoffs and sequels releasing in 2024 like Quiet Place day one, Gladiator 2(The first one is better), Alien Romulus, and Mufasa. Kingdom and the planet apes seems the best sequel and spinoff film of 2024. Fuck the Godzilla x Kong movie(weird film) Twisters is so underrated(much country music assshit). Bad boys 4 is a great and peak action film. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice is the most sequel nostalgia of Halloween lovers. Sonic 3 is the peak video game cinema of 2024. 
A24 and Neon did much of some good films like Civil War, Longlegs and Love lies bleeding. Heretic is my favorite. But so many Horror movies releasing in 2024 like Smile 2, Terrifer 3 and Speak No evil. Thriller films as well like Trap and Blink Twice. I havent seen Nosferatu yet there’s many people said it’s a peak horror film of 2024, and I’m going to watch today. The Substance is the top 5 films and the number one horror film of 2024 but it’s really much disturbing including the ending. Not sure to rewatch it lol. Anora is alright, there’s a chance to win Academy Award but this movie have much sexual content and some drugs in the movie that I’ve ever seen. Ending of Anora is so very satisfying, sadness and a bit disappointing. The Brutalist did came out last year and didn’t have the wide release yet. Same with Nickel Boys. Should be the best 2024 movie and could release in 2025. 
I hope 2025 cinema will be better than 2024. 2026 is so stacked with films. 

Top and best 5 films of 2024 that I have seen are Challengers, Dune Pt 2, Anora, The Substance and Conclave. ",0,4,1735768666.0,2025-01-01 21:57:46,False
gladiator,gladiator movie,1hqhgbd,I saw 71 movies in a theater this year. Here is my Personal Ranking List ,"Hello to those interested and about to read/skim this list and either comment on how good or bad it is. \[I wrote a ranking list last year of the 54 movies I saw in a theater. My New Year's Resolution was to see 55 movies in a theaters this year since I'm subscribed to A-List, and have 4 AMCs within 25 minutes of my house, and I surpassed the mark by 16 films this year with 71. Before you read the list/reviews, here are some quick notes:

\- 71-64: Pretty much the worst films I saw this year. These are films I would not recommend to anyone in the future, where I will mostly say negative things about the film (aka.... It Stinks!)

\- 63-56: are watchable films, with decent elements, but also aren't that good to me personally, and are possibly lacking in other areas. I would likely recommend the film to someone I know who would enjoy it, but also give a critique or two that I thought was missing

\- 55-27: Pretty much passable/watchable films that I at least thought were worth sitting through once, and could see myself sitting through again at some point in the future

\- 26-13: These are films I found pretty enjoyable from start to finish with very few issues that I could find in between. The higher these films are, the likelier it is that I would want to or be happy to watch these films again

\- 12-1: These are my personal best of the best from the year.

\- Some of these reviews are hyperlinked to my Instagram page. Feel free to give these a look, and follow if you would like

The List:

71.. Werewolves - Directed by Steven C. Miller: It REALLY Stinks

70.. The Book of Clarence - Directed by The Bullitts: I saw this as part of #AMCsScreenUnseen. And truth be told, it will be the last one. I am admittedly not much of a religious fanatic, so watching a film that bordered between”parody” and “epic” wasn’t a lot of fun for me or my fiancé. I did learn though why the Romans actually nailed Jesus’s hands and feet to the cross. So that was neat. It Stinks

69.. Borderlands - Directed by Eli Roth: Thanksgiving II can't come soon enough. It Stinks

68.. Night Swim - Directed by Bryce McGuire: Aka “We bought a pool”…. These are actual lines in the movie, and it’s what I always think of now when I’m reminded of this January filler. Mind you this is a quote from a supposedly famous baseball player that has millions, so how did he not purchase a place with a swimming pool before this….? It Stinks

67.. Argylle - Directed by Matthew Vaughn: I can only support you because of Kingsman for sooooo long before I have to say “enough”…. “Enough” with this Matt. We get it. Kingsman is cool, but this has been a wild fail of a universe for him to be building, and this latest installment in the “Kingsmen” universe is easily the worst and most forgettable one yet. It Stinks

66.. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire- Directed by Gil Kenan: I felt like you could tell how much Bill Murray was coerced into this movie because “$$$” talks. Just a painfully unfunny remake that included a subplot where Phoebe falls for a ghost, and tries to become one in order for her to receive her “7 minutes in heaven”, only to be double-crossed instead because it was all part of some elaborate plot to coerce her into doing all of this… if what I described sounds confusing, imagine what it felt like realizing this in the theater. It Stinks

65.. Kinds of Kindness - Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos: I saw “Poor Things” last year and had this rounding out my personal top 20. I also know that Yorgos makes polarizing films so this is in his wheelhouse. It’s three short films with one side character that interweaves them all together. For some, especially those that enjoy all of Yorgo’s work, this is another good installment. For me? Kinds of Kindness was just kind of “meh”.

64.. Here - Directed by Robert Zemeckis: Truth be told. This movie would’ve been further down the list if it wasn’t for the fact that this was part of a Double Feature that my fiancé and I did instead of watching the election results, and I will take this film 10 times out of 10 over watching that political theatre. Robert’s love for technology really seems to hurt the story in this one, along with the fact that a place’s “history” doesn’t actually feel historical when you watch it happen on screen.

63.. Joker: Folie a Deux - Directed by Todd Phillips: When the movie first ended I honestly have to admit I enjoyed it… but then I realized later that a big part of it was because my audience was SO upset by the final 10 minutes of the movie. Part satire, drama, and more “karaoke” than musical, it felt more like a parody of a musical than an actual one with Gaga barely being in this movie for the amount of marketing for this. You’re definitely not gonna be talking about this one the same way like the first movie.

62.. The Beekeeper - Directed by David Ayer: It’s a Jason Statham film. If you even like his movies, then park your butt on the couch and come watch another fun and mindless roller coaster where Claire Huxtable’s money is stolen, and it is up to Jason Stratham to save the day! (This is the actual plot of this movie)

61.. ISS - Directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite: The first 2/3rds of this movie are actually very well done, but it falls apart rapidly by the 1/3rd act where you then start pointing out some plotting issues. It’s a decent time if you can forget how it ends.

60.. Drive-Away Dolls - Directed by Ethan Coen: The Coen Bros. will always have my support for The Big Lebowski, so I was not going to miss this “low-stakes but fun” coming-of-age film where two women get caught in the middle of a heist involving the dumbest criminals I’ve watched on film this year. For those that are saying “I’m looking for something different with films I’m seeing these days”, there’s not many that are as out there with their plot than this one.

59.. I Saw the TV Glow - Directed by Jane Schoenbrun: If you find yourself going to the movies as often as I do, you will eventually stumble upon what I call your personal “Beau is Afraid” film. The “Beau is Afraid” film I basically term as a film that is well-directed, and even makes compels you all the way until the end… and then once it ends, you wonder “what the fuck just happened?”, and this is my “Beau is Afraid” film for this year. It is a well directed and acted film about two people growing up in the 90s, and then becoming older before even knowing it. It is very anxiety inducing, and will end with you feeling pretty uneasy

58.. IF - Directed by John Krasinski: This is a kid’s film that is truly for kids, while also tying in an adult stake of a father going through “surgery” (although it’s not specified what that surgery even is?). There are some nice moments, notably when Bea is creating the imaginary world around her, but it’s likely something your kid will play on repeat far more than you will. If you’re a parent, get headphones

57.. The Fall Guy - Directed by David Leitch: An ode to stuntmen, that certainly had great action scenes. However, I personally thought that it was too far between a slowly drawn out plot. Come for the action, make dinner for the dialogue.

56.. Babygirl - Directed by Halina Reijn: I was a big fan of “Bodies, Bodies, Bodies”, and this is a decent follow up from the director regarding the cinematography. An incredibly well shot film. However, I still question how Romy did all of these objectively fireable/“voted off the board” offenses, and the biggest penalty is that she takes on a more BTS role as the CEO while those “protecting/blackmailing” her are given higher positions. Not to mention that the final sequence in the film heavily implied to me that she found her “sexual awakening” and repaired her marriage through this love affair, and should have possibly done it sooner. So it kind of felt like a 2 hour dissertation to have an affair, when 99% of the time when practiced, you are justifiably scrutinized hard for it, while also ruining lives, including your own, in its wake. And it’s barely touched in this movie. Until promiscuity becomes a true norm, I don’t see what was depicted in the film actually going over the way it did in Babygirl.

55.. Kung Fu Panda 4 - Directed by Mike Mitchell: It’s another film that pretty much pales in comparison to the original, but it’s still passable in every way as well offering more of what we’ve all come to love from Poe. My favorite part though had to be the ending credits where Tenacious D did their cover of “Hit Me Baby One More Time”.

54.. The Garfield Movie - Directed by Mark Dindal: I won’t deny that this film is very low on my list, but I will say that for a film no one was really clamoring for, I enjoyed this a lot. At least a lot more than the live-action ones that came out in 2004 when I was a kid. It’s more of the same from the feline companion, but the animation looks good, and it treats the source material fairly well with who Garfield really is… a lazy and food loving cat who begrudgingly loves the people in his life.

53.. Moana 2 - Directed by David Ledoux Miller, Jason Hand, and David Derrick Jr.: This is an interesting film because it was initially not intended to be one. The animated mini-series wound up blossoming into a pretty worthy sequel that does well to build on Moana’s universe, while also giving us the fun we’ve come to expect from Maui. I should note though that it does not hit the emotional highs as the first, so hopefully the third film will go back to its own “roots” and rehire LMM to create some more classics.

52.. Trap - Directed by M. Night Shyamalan: The film is not too memorable, and admittedly can be considered a “front” for M. Night’s daughter to help her own career (she’s one of the leads in this movie), but gosh is Josh Hartnett compelling on screen. He pretty much carries this film to a passable status because of how good of an actor he is. Shoutout for Cudi as well in his brief cameo. If you can put Cudi in anything, it definitely makes it at least a few points better for me.

51.. Nosferatu - Directed by Robert Eggers: After 102 years, Nosferatu was finally resurrected and given an update. And it is certainly every bit as gothic and horrifying as its original… but also I wasn’t a huge fan of the pacing. It took a while for the dread to settle in for me. However, I am happy that this was given a chance by Eggers to even be made.

50.. Mean Girls - Directed by Samantha Jane, Arturo Perez Jr.: While I don’t really peg it as the true classic that defined the mid-late 2000s, I personally enjoyed this musical follow-up.

49.. Wonka - Directed by Paul King: My 1st film of 2024. When this was first announced, I do recall a collective “why”, but the truth is that this was a nice film that gives some fun backstory to Willy Wonka and how he built his factory. Also helped reveal Timothee’s range and expand into family films

48.. Twisters - Directed by Lee Isaac Chung: It was fun watching the pre-interview screening and hearing how the cast was on location for this film, and truth be told, it’s not a bad sequel from a film released 28 years earlier. In fact, the technology today helps enhance it for a screen that was worthy for IMAX/Dolby. There’s not much plot, and the climax borders on “suspension”, but it’s still a thrilling ride. If you FEEL it! CHASE it!

47.. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire - Directed by Adam Wingard: Living in the “Godzillasance” is one of the things keeping me hyped in life currently. If you would’ve told me this as a kid? Even then I would not believe you and discuss how “Zilla” ruined the franchise. So I will pretty much watch all films until the wheels fall off. I mention this because this is not necessarily the best “Godzilla” film. Truth be told, it’s about 75% Kong, and 25% Godzilla. But those few scenes that Godzilla is in are still awesome. That fight between Kong and Godzilla in Egypt was bonkers.

46.. Abigail - Directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett: This film reminded me a lot of “Renfield”, which was a favorite of mine last year. However, I felt it took itself a bit too seriously compared to other campy vampire films like “Renfeld” and the classic “From Dusk Till Dawn”

45.. Boy Kills World - Directed by Moritz Mohr: It’s nice to see Bill Skarsgard without a ton of makeup on. Not to mention he gets to be a cool badass in this movie that involves H Jon Benjamin doing narration cause he’s a mute. Thie lack of “Bob Belcher” in the 2nd half lost it a bit for me.

44.. Lisa Frankenstein - Directed by Zelda Williams: Robin Williams’s daughter’s directorial debut, and it was a fun and campy time where the stakes were very low, and everyone involved seems to be enjoying themselves. It’s worth it just to watch everyone have a fun time with this movie.

43.. Cuckoo - Directed by Tilman Singer: This film was a pretty supervise trip. I won’t forget when the girl starts hallucinating in the car and I was wondering at first if the film was breaking, and then realizing that she’s losing control. As someone who’s dabbled with hallucinogenics, that is a real feeling that happens. This ties into this weird undercurrent that stays with this film compared to the others on this list.

42.. Love Lies Bleeding - Directed by Rose Glass: This movie was sexy and violent, and also comes with an ending twist that I’ve only come to expect A24 to deliver on. If it was any other studio, I would’ve likely hated the ending, but it’s A24, and they’ve built up so much goodwill that I can respect the originality on it.

41.. In A Violent Nature - Directed by Chris Nash: The ending is divisive, but I personally loved the whole idea that we’re watching the movie through the killer’s perspective. The dread of seeing how he was about to murder the people was a new feeling for me with horror. The ending is ambiguous enough for a possible sequel, and I hope that happens.

40.. Tuesday - Directed by Diana O. Pusic: A medium on death through the perspective of a parrot doesn’t sound like a usual concept for a film, but Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Lola Petticrew make this a nice emotional study of a mom coming to terms with her daughter’s terminal diagnosis. For myself, I was fortunate to be part of a Q&A with the director and actors after which enhanced the experience.

39.. Thelma - Directed by Josh Margolin: Another nice little medium on aging that was based on a personal experience by the director when his own grandmother was almost scammed out of money. The piece is very personal as evidenced by the fact that he not only directed the film, but wrote and edited it as well. And what results is a low-stakes, but relatable piece about our loved ones and how we accept our age.

38.. The Bikeriders  - Directed by Jeff Nichols: A nice film that, much like the people the actors are portraying, seems to coast by until the film reaches its conclusion. It’s very well acted, and if you’re curious about a part of America that you might know about, this can educate you a bit on it, but there are elements missing that make this a a classic like “Easy Rider”

37.. Blitz - Directed by Steve McQueen: The WWII historian in me is a sucker for a film that actually covers the Blitz. And when the action is really happening, it does VERY well where I can’t help but respect it. However, there are continuity issues I spotted during the film which left me confused once it concluded.

36.. \[Red One\](https://www.instagram.com/p/DCR1FKhP5EV/?igsh=MXVnaTdtaHJ5ZXlr) - Directed by Jake Kasdan: Maybe it’s my admitted love for The Final Boss since I am a big pro-wrestling stan, but I really didn’t find this to be nearly as bad as I thought it was. It was pretty much a Marvel film, but stripped of the IP and framing it around Santa. Not the best film, but not the worst. Can certainly see kids gravitating and watching it again just to reenact scenes that happened.

35.. Bad Boys: Ride or Die - Directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah: You would’ve though that they’d flip “Ride or Die” and “4 Life” since it makes more sense, but I digress. This is a fun time with Martin Lawrence pretty much stealing the show with every scene he was in. I was cackling through half of his lines. Also, love how they gave Marcus the ultimate redemption arc.\\

34.. Monkey Man - Directed by Dev Patel: What happens when you take an orphan who is angry with the world and throw him into the caste system? Monkey man. A strong directorial from director/star Dev Patel, who takes his revenge out unmercifully on his way to the top.

33.. The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare - Directed by Guy Ritchie: It’s a slick take on an unknown WWII story by Guy Ritchie. IF you like his films like I do, you will have a good time with this since it’s basically Henry Cavill and Alan Ritchson + others killing Nazis.

32.. Piece by Piece - Directed by Morgan Neville: There’s a possibility that this was solely done through “LEGOs” because Universal wanted ot retain the rights. There’s likely truth to it, but I also would not be surprised if one of the most influential music producers of the 21st century wanted to make this doc “feel” different than others. And the truth is that it’s a great and innovative time. You kind of get to peak inside his mind a bit thanks to the animation as opposed to if this was live-action. The great music he produced is also littered throughout so this can be a good time to bond with your kid about great music that was collaborated on by a great producer.

31.. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes - Directed by Wes Ball: Prior to Kingdom, Wes’s only directing credit was for The Maze Runner, which I admittedly don’t have a huge desire to see currently. So when I heard he was announced as the director for this movie I was admittedly hesitant…  After? I hope he’s given the keys to build the universe. Very fine follow up that inches us that much closer to the eventual remake of “PotA”

30.. Gladiator II - Directed by Ridley Scott: The movie’s scale and scope are pretty epic this time around compared to the first, and Denzel just owns this movie the moment he steps on screen. He’s the man. If he was not in this movie, it would be a lot further down my list.

29.. Transformers: One- Directed by Josh Cooley: It’s unfortunate that this film was DOA, because it’s easily the best Transformers film I watched, and this is from someone who is more of a passive fan. The origin stories of Optimus and Megatron felt genuine, and Chris gave a great VO performance. I felt by the end that he was the Optimus Prime of my childhood.

28.. Sonic the Hedgehog 3 - It's rare when the 3rd part winds up being the best, but this is exactly what Sonic the Hedgehog 3 was. It was probably the closest adaptation that I've seen of the original games, and Jim Carrey just seemed to be enjoying playing as Dr. Eggman again. The laser dance sequence was also my personal favorite dance scene of the year.

27.. Heretic - Directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods: There is apparently a lot of personal experience put into this movie, with comments that I read speaking about how this movie did a pretty good job portraying the “missionary” experience of mormonism. And while I can’t admittedly say the finish was my taste, it was the very compellingly disturbing performance from ""rom-com"" legend Hugh Grant.

26.. Y2K - Directed by Kyle Mooney: It’s been a long time since I’ve cackled in a theater for a b-level comedy, and this was just the perfect blend of a nostalgia and cringe to remind me of a time before iPhones, where Fred Durst and “The Thong Song” was on everyone’s mixtape

25.. Deadpool & Wolverine - Directed by Shawn Levy: This will hopefully be the shot of adrenaline that Marvel needs to course correct while they’ve got the chance. For the first R-rated MCU film, it was a very fun time, and had me straight up geeking out during the bus sequence when Wolverine put on the mask.

24.. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice - Directed by Tim Burton: I’ve got love for the Juice. And watching the town of Winter River come back to life was a joy to see, along with how much fun Michael Keaton seemed to be having paying Beetlejuice again. He’s infectious in the role, and while it admittedly falls short of the first film, there’s room for one more possible movie to help really stick this landing.

23.. Longlegs - Directed by Oz Perkins: What a thriller this was. I was surprised at just how off-putting Nicholas Cage actually as in this role. It might be one of my favorites simply for that fact because I was creeped out by him for most of this film. The twist was also fun for myself, especially since the ending was pretty bleak

22.. Speak No Evil - Directed by Christian Dafdrup: This film is pretty much the inverse of Longlegs where you can probably spot the twist coming, but it does not take away from the thrill of the journey to get there. James McAvoy is at his creepy best, and it is disturbing to watch how twisted he becomes as the film continues.

21.. The Wild Robot - Directed by Chris Sanders: The only thing I could think of once this concluded? “Wow. What a delightful movie”. Age won’t matter in this heartfelt film about finding your way, being accepted, and surviving, even if the road is treacherous. Equal parts funny and touching, it can either be a great family film, or a great medium on what it means to be a parent.

20.. Inside Out 2 - Directed by Kelsey Mann: I’m a clinical therapist by trade. So I have an incredibly soft spot for Inside Out and how it teaches us about who we are and the emotions that make us up. So of course I have been using this sequel as a resource since it honestly does an even better job explaining the emotions we have now, compared to the first. Life becomes more complex and socially complicated the older we get. Little things we say or do can have big ramifications that we can ruminate over like an endless replay. And Inside Out 2 did a great job explaining some of these new emotions, with anxiety leading the pack. If you have not seen it yet, I highly recommend giving it a watch to at least understand our emotions a bit better.

19.. One Life - Directed by James Hawes: Not many know the heroic tale of Nichols Winston and his courage to have 669 Jewish children adopted before WWII began. And this film does a fine job discussing the stakes, the drama, and the courage that Nicholas and his peers had to help these kids find safety before it was too late. It is a difficult film to watch, but also necessary to show the humanity that is still there in others.

18.. The Apprentice - Directed by Ali Abbasi: There are a lot that have had enough of this person, and are dreading what is to come. So it is appropriate to say “why the fuck do we need more media covering him?” Well the truth is that regardless of your opinion, the incoming president is going to be looked at as a very historical figure in human history, and it’s films like The Apprentice that will hopefully teach a future generation about how we got here, and why it was awful to let it happen. I wish luck to the future impersonators of the former tv host, because Sebastian Stan gives a haunting performance that sets the bar incredibly high for future impersonations. By the end of this movie, I thought he had actually become him. And this doesn’t get into my thoughts on Jeremy Strong as Roy Cohn. Legitimately jaw-dropping performance by him. Due to the risks involved that both of these men have taken, I do hope that it pays off in some Oscar nominations, because they do deserve it.

17.. Didi - Directed by Sean Wang: Avery intimate film about an “American experience” through the life of a Korean teenager learning to find his own place in the world. He’s got a mom who cares for him, but is also hoping for him to be more structured, and a grandma who the main character can’t help but care for, along with an annoying sister who he begrudgingly loves. It’s a very human film that touches on a lot of beats that make this a great film worth seeing.

16.. My Old Ass - Directed by Megan Park: Part “Arrival”, and part “About Time”, this film is a lovely and poignant piece about love, loss, and what this person would do if they knew about the inevitable. It is a very touching movie about what our heart wants.

15.. Late Night with the Devil - Directed by Cameron & Colin Cairnes: Led by famous character actor David Dastmalchian, this is the first movie I found since “Nightcrawler” to flip the lens on the media itself, and what exactly “drives” our interest. It is done as a “found” documentary film, which helps add to the uneasiness as the film continues. David does a genuinely good job carrying the lead which hopefully leads to more opportunities in the future, and while the final act is divisive, it is still an interesting take on the media, and how far one is willing to go to grab a rating.

14.. A Quiet Place: Day One - Directed by Michael Sarnoski: Some will say it didn’t show enough destruction of NYC, but this to me was just like Cloverfield where you feel more of the peril of the characters who are stuck in the city with no idea on what exactly is going on. Given the budget was also only $67 million, it is impressive what little destruction scenes Michael was able to capture on film, and tied it into a human story of a person enjoying one last slice of pizza at the end of the world.

13.. Smile 2 - Directed by Parker Finn: Because of I use film as a self-care activity, my fiancé has come along with me to enjoy pretty much every film that is out in theaters. She has also watched other movies to catch her up on sequels. And this was very important because she whispered to me at the beginning of Smile 2 that what was happening was canonically 6 days after the person saw the main character kill herself in the first movie. This was important to me because this film is not going to hold your hand. It’s going to mess with you from the start, making you second guess everything that you’re watching as the host latches itself onto a popstar, and is prepared to start a mass casualty event once it's done with her.

12.. Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga - Directed by George Miller: It’s a damn shame this movie didn’t take off. Like, I know it wasn’t something we were asking for. But my god, I am SO happy that I went to watch this. The gates of Valhalla are still just as shiny and chrome as ever in this prequel, where we learn more of the lore that led to the insane action film of 2015. And there is one particular sequence called the “Stairway to Nowhere” that is probably one of the most well shot sequences to be released this year. In addition, Chris Hemsworth gives his best performance to date play the diabolical Dementus, who pretty much is the inverse of Thor. He’s dirty, ugly, a menace, and does not care about anyone. That is, except for “Littal D”. If you are a fan of the Mad Max saga, then it is more than worth traveling back to the wasteland for this.

11.. Anora - Directed by Sean Baker: Earlier I mentioned how I watched “Here” to distract me from this year’s general election, I watched another as well, and I could not be happier that it was this. What an amazingly well-crafted film. It’s a dirty and real take on what we are hoping for with our “American Dream”, and Mikey absolutely SHINES in this role that was legitimately made for her. She is “Anora”, and I don’t think any actress could really pull off the role as well as she did. There is lots of word swirling that this is going to be an “Oscar” darling, and I do hope that it is because it is equal parts sexy, hilarious, and tragic.

10.. Saturday Night - Directed by Jason Reitman: Being up front, I am a huge SNL stan, and will always admire those that have made it onto the show. What not many know about though is just how much of a “maverick” this show and Lorne were. The executives did not give this show much of a chance, along with some of Lorne’s actors going AWOL hours before the show was supposed to air, and a set that literally ignited hours before the first show. How Lorne actually got this program off the ground is just as amazing as it is for him to keep it running for 50 years, and this film does an admirable job showing the chaos and love that is behind this cultural staple in TV history.

9.. Memoir of a Snail - Directed by Adam Elliot: My favorite animated film this year. Adam directed another film a while back called “Max & Mary” that was also very well done. “Memoir of a Snail” pretty much adds elements that were lacking in the previous film, and enhances it to help become an even more personal experience about a melancholic woman who hoards snails to as a way to shelter herself from all of the stressors that have occurred in her life. It’s tragic, and hopeful, and makes you hope for more adult animated films.

8.. Civil War - Directed by Alex Garland: The title speaks for itself, doesn’t it? It is a film taking place through the lens of war photographers. These people help push Alex’s bigger story about what it might look like if it all goes to hell in this country, and he doesn’t make it easy. This movie reminded me a lot of Contagion in how it tried to ground itself to make it feel like “this CAN happen”. The only difference between Contagion and Civil War is that this film actually moved me where I felt shocked and depressed after. It is a very bleak outlook on our future, but one that I can’t help but respect just for even attempting to make an uncomfortable movie like Civil War.

7.. A Real Pain - Directed by Jesse Eisenberg: Another “lived experience” film that hits deeply to me due to my own cultural roots. As a Jewish person, I question my existence constantly, and this film pretty much encapsulates that experience for me as a millennial who has a direct lineage to family members who passed away our survived from the Holocaust. The love we have for others run deep, and it can be exhausting… but we still love them despite what they do, and it’s what I love and appreciate about this film the most

6.. Alien: Romulus - Directed by Fede Alvarez: I’ve waited too long to finally watch a proper Alien movie on a movie screen, and I finally got it with this addition by Fede. This film pretty much takes the genre back to its roots about just why this franchise is so terrifying to begin with. The movie intentionally moves at a slow pace at first, but once the characters go inside that incubator chamber… 0-1000 in an instant, and it doesn’t let up until it ends. This is exactly what fans of the Alien franchise had been hoping for, and I’m glad I can finally say I saw a legitimately terrifying Alien movie on the big screen in my life.

5.. DUNE: Part II- Directed by Denis Villeneuve: If you thought Part I of this epic saga on Arrakis was wild, the 2nd Part pretty much adds onto everything, with strong performances by all who were involved, but especially Javier Bardem, who channels his inner “Monty Python” to deliver a hilarious, but also very realistic take on a devout follower who believes that Timothee is the Mahdi. And the truth is, by the end of this movie I was ready to crown him the Mahdi myself. This was an epic continuation of a saga that has one more battle to be prepared for.

4.. Wicked: Part I - Directed by Jon Chu: I love broadway. I find it a fantastic medium where craft, music, acting, and dancing come to life all in an instant. Translating a broadway show to become a movie is not easy, but Jon and his crew knocked it out of the part with the first rendition of Wicked. I found myself loving a lot of parts to this movie. From the singing, to the feeling of being transported back into Oz for the first time since watching the original, to Ariana’s rendition of Popular, to “Defying Gravity”, to the fact that 2 hours and 40 minutes did not feel that long, to the fact that the movie ended like it was the “intermission”, and not the true end to the film. Jon and his team seemed to spare no expense when it came to making this musical feel like we’re watching the broadway play at a massive discount. And I appreciate them for that because broadway plays are expensive. They all delivered a stunning film that feels every bit as magical as the first time we all stepped into Oz. What is great for them now is they can ride the momentum of the first film into Part II next year without doing anything because they already finished the shoot. Can’t deny it is a brilliant marketing strategy that will probably make massive money in the long run. I know I’m going to be there opening night to see the finale.

3.. Kill - Directed by Nikhil Nagesh Bhat: As much as I love musicals… I love one man army’s even more. And this genuinely could be the scariest one man army I have ever come across. I first learned about this film from one of those trailers that are packed with reviews that say “you have to see this movie.” Since I had nothing better to do on July 4th I figured, why not? And I’m very glad I did that because Amrit Rathod is the scariest dude walking the planet. I am fully convinced he can take on Jason Bourne and John Wick and come out on top after watching this insanity. Make no mistake, Amrit is a different animal compared to the others. He lives by a code, and once it’s broken, you better start preparing your last rites, cause he will break you down until you’re absolutely nothing... And THEN he will kill you. I honestly think this movie could’ve possibly pushed the genre even further because of some of the there are simply kills that I have not seen before on the big screen, and this movie was not shy at all in delivering them.

2.. The Zone of Interest - Directed by Jonathan Glazer: Probably the most educational film about The Holocaust that has ever been made, or aside from since Schindler’s List. What I love about this movie is that unlike Schindler, there is nothing good about this film. It is awful. And you come to realize just how “banal” we truly are as a species once it’s done. I found myself growing more detested as the film continued. And that is its point. At one time this was not a movie. This was a real, world-changing event that occurred where people were sent to concentration camps to suffer and die, and all of us as a species grew desensitized to the point that we did not feel any remorse for these “fellow” humans (and truth be told, I still don’t)… all the while the scum were standing less than 20 feet away pretending that they were not committing the atrocities that they were. This is the inverse of “One Life” where instead of educating us on the good that humans are capable of, it shows us just how evil we really are, and that is admittedly a much bigger reality than the miracles and good people that DO occur during these awful times. In order to possibly prevent it in the future, we need to still educate today. And this film is as educational as it gets.

1.. American Fiction - Directed by Cord Jefferson: It’s unfortunate this movie came out in the completely packed year that was 2023, because this is easily one of my favorite “American experience” movies I remember, and I think it’s because of how mundane it is that I love it so much. The characters are going through their own sets of trauma that would be very similar to ours, and also have a dynamic that feels very natural to the relationships we have with our loved ones. Jeffery Wright and Sterling K. Brown also give fantastic performances that are equally hilarious, endearing, and thought-provoking as well. What is so fantastic too is how much they make the dialogue feel natural. It really feels like you’re living the life with this writer as he uncovers the hypocrisy and racial dynamics in an incredibly niche aspect of society. The way Jefferson makes it all thread perfectly was so much fun. My favorite part though that cements this as my favorite has to be the ending. It’s kind of abrupt, but also in this very well done way that reminds us that just like the main characters in this movie, life will continue onwards, and it’s what we do with it that is really going to matter the most.

Re-releases I watched:

\- In addition to the 71 films I watched, I also saw two re-releases, Coraline and Interstellar to total out to 73 movies I went to see.

Conclusion:

I saw a lot more films than I did last year, which is great because it (hopefully) shows to me that the industry itself is at least churning out regular features again. If you would've told me this back in 2020, there's no way I'd believe you. While the recovery isn't there yet, and there are genuine critiques on a lack of originality, it's nice to know how strong this year was when it comes to regular releases. So with that, I hope you enjoyed reading the list as much as I did watching, ranking, reflecting, and reviewing on the year that was 2024 in movies. Would like to know your thoughts on the list and your personal favorites as well. To 2025, the year of our remake, and Superman.",6,36,1735660309.0,2024-12-31 15:51:49,False

gladiator,gladiator movie,1hpp7yt,"December 27-29 Box Office Recap: 'Sonic 3' and 'Mufasa' fight for the top spot at the box office. 'Nosferatu' opens with a fantastic $40.3 million in its first five days, already becoming Robert Eggers' highest grossing film. 'A Complete Unknown' settles for sixth place with $23.1 million.","https://preview.redd.it/k21dn07d40ae1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b2edf912cefe80f8f6936c9ec0814e5006ae794

#**Normally you'd wait till the Weekend Actuals are out. But the numbers are delayed due to the holidays, so you'll only have estimates for now. The same could happen next week.**

It was a fierce battle at the box office.

***Sonic 3*** and ***Mufasa: The Lion King*** fought for the top spot, with the hedgehog currently leaning on the top spot for now. On Christmas, we got 4 newcomers, with mixed results. ***Nosferatu*** delivered a fantastic debut and became Robert Eggers' highest grossing film in just 5 days, while ***A Complete Unknown*** had a very solid start. On the other hand, ***Babygirl*** had a soft start, while ***The Fire Inside*** failed to attract interest.

The Top 10 earned a combined $159.2 million this weekend. That's up a huge 58% from last year, when ***Wonka*** returned to the top spot.

Staying on top, ***Sonic 3*** earned $38 million this weekend ($59.9 million five-day). That represents a 37% drop, which is better than the previous films. There were concerns over the weekdays, as it appeared that it was front-loaded and would show weak legs, but it looks like it recovered for now.

Through ten days, the film has amassed $136.8 million. It should have another great hold this weekend, which will allow it to hit $200 million very soon. It can go as high as $250 million at this pace.

Settling for second place, ***Mufasa*** made $37.1 million this weekend ($63.7 million five-day). That's a very nice 5% increase from last weekend. It had a soft debut but it's showing some strength. Through 10 days, it has made $113.4 million. Despite this increase, the film is still off a massive 68% from the 2019 film through the same point. We'll see how much it can earn through the holidays.

Exceeding expectations, Robert Eggers' ***Nosferatu*** debuted with a fantastic $21.1 million this weekend ($40.3 million five-day). This is not just Eggers' biggest debut by a wide margin, but it's already his highest grossing film domestically, passing ***The Northman*** ($34.2 million). It's also the fourth biggest debut for Focus Features.

This is an amazing result in any sense of the word, and showed that Eggers could finally hit the mainstream audience (***The Northman*** was supposed to be that film, but it didn't quite land at the box office). But that still raises the question: how was this film able to debut this high and far above Eggers' films? Credit must go to a fantastic marketing campaign, which offered enough intrigue and darkness to attract audiences. The decision to hide Bill Skarsgård's appearance as the iconic Count Orlok from the trailers panned out very well; if you want to watch him, you have to pay a ticket.

It can be said that Eggers' brand has also increased in past years. While ***The Northman*** wasn't a box office hit, Focus Features confirmed that the film eventually became profitable after a few months thanks to strong VOD numbers and other post-theatrical markets, and this was a big reason why they were confident in greenlighting ***Nosferatu***. Also, while remaking a 1922 silent German Expressionist film feels like it would struggle to get recognition, ***Nosferatu*** actually had some exposure to the audience. A lot of kids were introduced to this character in that iconic ***SpongeBob SquarePants*** episode. That helped the film build awareness. 

According to Focus Features, 55% of the audience was male and 56% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. While critics raved about the film, audiences wasn't as much; they gave it a weak ""B–"" on CinemaScore. That's not actually a bad score for a horror film, given they often fall in the C range. Nevertheless, without horror competition till ***Wolf Man*** in mid January, ***Nosferatu*** should hold well through the holidays. While it's unclear how much it can earn, one thing is clear: this is hitting $100 million domestically, which is an amazing result.

***Wicked*** rose 37%, adding $19.4 million this weekend ($31.7 million five-day). On Christmas day, it added a sing-along version, which boosted the numbers. The film has earned a fantastic $424 million so far.

After its weak legs, ***Moana 2*** had its best drop so far. It jumped 38%, adding $18.2 million this weekend. A much needed recovery, given it wasn't holding well after its gigantic opening. The film has earned $394.6 million so far, and will hit the $400 million milestone in a few days.

Debuting in sixth place, Searchlight's ***A Complete Unknown*** earned $11.6 million ($23.1 million five-day). This is one of the best debuts for Searchlight, and its opening day ($7.2 million) was a record for the studio. If we want to compare it to James Mangold's films, the five-day debut is slightly above of what ***Walk the Line*** made in 3 days ($22.3 million). 

This is a solid start, and the only reason why it's not fantastic is that it's carrying an extensive $60-$70 million budget, putting a lot of pressure in the film. Bob Dylan is one of the most iconic singers and songwriters of the past century, although he is still not as popular as other musicians in other biopics. For example, Queen, Elton John and Bob Marley are more popular with current audiences than Dylan. So the film had only one selling point: its star Timothée Chalamet.

Like him or not, Chalamet is one of the most popular young stars of our times. He already had huge hits in the past year with ***Wonka*** and ***Dune: Part Two***, and he's already set for another film, ***Marty Supreme***, which also opens on Christmas Day next year. Deadline reported that 36% of the audience watched the film for Chalamet, cementing a status as a box office draw. Reviews were also solid enough to win over audiences, and some Oscar buzz is on the horizon.

According to Searchlight, the audience was equally split between men and women. Unsurprisingly, the big demo was adults; 62% of the audience was 35 and over. They gave it a strong ""A"" on CinemaScore, which bodes very well for its legs. And you have to remember that this is targeting an old audience, which doesn't rush out to watch a film as soon as possible. We'll keep an eye on this one, but the incoming Oscar buzz should help it stay in theaters for quite  a long time.

In a distant seventh place, A24's ***Babygirl*** earned $4.3 million ($7.2 million five-day). That's quite a soft start, especially considering that the film was playing in 2,115 theaters, and the fact that A24 pushed it as its main attraction for the holidays.

The film is sold as an erotic thriller, but that can be a mixed bag at the box office. Outside the ***Fifty Shades of Grey***, erotic thrillers haven't performed very well at the box office. And despite having a big name in Nicole Kidman, she hasn't had a good run as of late; she hasn't had a single box office hit since ***The Upside*** back in 2019. Her recent success has been on streaming and on TV, leaving questions over her star power at the box office (even though she's the face of AMC).

According to A24, 53% of the audience was female and 44% of the audience was 35 and over. While critics were positive of the film, the audience wasn't forgiving; they gave it a very weak ""B–"" on CinemaScore, which might be due to the nature of the film itself. While Kidman has some Oscar buzz, it would be a surprise if the film made anything above $20 million domestically.

***Gladiator II*** continues showing some great late legs. The film eased just 9% and earned $4.1 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $163 million. It's gonna head to around $175 million.

Angel Studios' ***Homestead*** had the worst drop in the Top 10. It dropped 47%, adding $3.1 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $12.8 million, and it suggests that it will fall off when the holidays are over.

Rounding up the Top 10 was the last newcomer of the week, Amazon MGM's ***The Fire Inside***. Despite setting it at 2,006 theaters, the film bombed with just $2 million ($4.3 million five-day). That's the 28th worst debut for any film playing at 2,000+ theaters.

This isn't a surprising result. Amazon didn't appear to focus on properly marketing the film, choosing to simply dump it on Christmas and hoping that it would find an audience. After all, ***The Boys in the Boat*** over-performed last year, showing there was a market for sports dramas. But the film simply lacked a hook; people simply weren't interested in Claressa Shields' story. Even with the talent involved, it simply wasn't enough.

According to MGM, 51% of the audience was female and 51% was 35 and over. On the bright side, the audience gave it a strong ""A"" on CinemaScore, which fits nicely with its great reviews. But even with that, it's unlikely it can turn things around.

***Kraven the Hunter*** slightly recovered after its awful second weekend drop, even if it fell on the bad side of the drops. It dropped 44%, adding $1.7 million this weekend. Sadly, with an anemic $21.3 million domestic total so far, there's nothing to celebrate here. It might hit $25 million, but it won't get much higher than that.

But while ***Kraven*** kept showing weak legs, ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** does not appear to have any legs. The film collapsed 63%, earning just $455,000 this weekend. Absolutely horrible considering the rest of the films had fantastic holds. The film has made just $8.5 million domestically, and it's now guaranteed to finish below $10 million.

Paramount chose to open the Robbie Williams biopic ***Better Man*** in 6 theaters, ahead of its wide release on January 10. But the film flopped with just $18,000 ($35,000 five-day), which translates to a very poor $3,000 per-theater average. Not a surprise, considering Williams failed to find an audience in America. This is a bad sign for its wide release.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Mufasa*** was still on top in the rest of the world, albeit only slightly. It added $77 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $327 million. The best markets currently are France ($20.9M), UK ($15.8M), Mexico ($15.5M), Italy ($14.4M) and Germany ($13.6M).

***Sonic 3*** made its debut in the rest of the world, debuting with a dazzling $74 million in 52 markets, taking its worldwide total to $210 million. That's a huge 83% of the second film's debut. The best debuts were the UK ($15.1M), Mexico ($10.3M), France ($7.3M), Australia ($5.5M), Germany ($5.5M), Spain ($3.3M), Panama ($2.3M); Peru ($1.6M), Colombia ($1.3M) and Malaysia ($1.3M), all of which were records for the franchise. It should have no problem hitting $500 million, and it still has some markets left.

***Moana 2*** added $36 million this weekend, and its worldwide total is now $882 million. The best markets are France ($53.9M), UK ($42.6M), Germany ($34.8M), Mexico ($28.2M) and Brazil ($25.7M).

In a major milestone, ***Wicked*** has now passed ***Mamma Mia!*** to become the highest grossing Broadway adaptation, with a current worldwide total of $634 million. The best markets are the UK ($67M), Australia ($24.8M), Korea ($14.2M), Germany ($11.8M) and Mexico ($9.9M).

96 of my screenings had cast and/or crew present for Q&As/intros. 

I do these rankings and reviews/random thoughts for fun. It’s not meant to be taken super seriously. I just like movies, and I like ranking them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Red Rooms** - 10/10 - The most gripping psychological-thriller since *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*.  Extremely disturbing and unsettling at times, but also stylish and sleek. The courtroom scenes and vampire-movie-like score stick with you for a long time. Juliette Gariépy puts in the best performance of anyone this year. There's so much amazing stuff happening with French-Canadian cinema recently and this is another great addition. Best movie of the year. One of the best movies of the past decade.

**Dune: Part Two** - 9/10 - Sci-fi doesn't get much better than this. I have the seemingly-unpopular opinion that the first movie is better than the second, but both are near-perfect. Everything that can be said about Dune 1/2 has pretty much already been said. 

**Anora** - 9/10

**Civil War** - 9/10

**Nosferatu** - 9/10 - Gothic horror is so back. Lily-Rose Depp does things in this movie physically that I've never seen before on the big screen. Extremely impressed with her performance (and with Hoult/Dafoe/Skarsgard/Corrin as well). A great ensemble surrounded with perfect set design, direction, and cinematography. Loved the scenes in the castle that almost appeared black-and-white. Robert Eggers has not missed for me so far, and this is my favorite of his.

**Challengers** - 9/10

**Sing Sing** - 9/10 - Colman Domingo, give that man his Oscar [John Malkovich Rounders voice].

**The Substance** - 9/10

**You Are Not Alone** - 9/10 -	Part La La Land, part Under the Skin, part Eternal Sunshine. A beautiful and hypnotic sci fi love story with a slight horror edge and with layers upon layers of metaphor.  It has a lot of interesting things to say about mid-20s loneliness/thoughts of suicide/love/etc.

**Didi** - 9/10 -  I'm a sucker for coming-of-age dramas set in recent times. Give me more of this and mid90s-type movies pls.

**The Order** - 8/10

**We Live In Time**	- 8/10 - I went in expecting heartbreak (which I got), but I didn’t expect how funny/sharp it would be. Florence and Andrew have 10/10 chemistry. Only thing keeping it from a higher score is the goofy Super Bowl of Food or whatever scene near the end. The scene at the beginning in the parking garage might be one of the most heart wrenching and well-acted scenes of the entire year. Top-tier score as well.

**Love Lies Bleeding** - 8/10 - I would watch a 2-hour movie montage of Katy O'Brian working out beneath a highway underpass. A violent & twisted mess of sweat/blood/sex/tears/ungodly bodily noises. A real wicked fun time.

**The Goldman Case** - 8/10 - French courtroom dramas, so hot right now. An insanely smart and water-tight screenplay with engrossing performances. It reminded me a lot of Anatomy of a Fall then I realized the co-star (Arthur Harari) in this film is the co-writer of Anatomy.

**The Beast** - 8/10 - A movie that's almost impossible to describe but I'll try: Dystopian-future-sci-fi, period-drama, modern-incel-breakin-thriller, all while staying completely original and beautiful. Extremely layered story and performances. Lea Seydoux and George MacKay are 2 of my favorite actors and they pulled this off with extreme precision and care. One of more harrowing final scenes of the year for sure. 

**Conclave** - 8/10

**Saturday Night** - 8/10 - Frenetic, engaging, and a really fun time. Flies by. I wanted more. So much energy.

**September 5** - 8/10

**The Brutalist** - 8/10 - I have some problems with the ending, feels like it undid a lot of what was experienced, but otherwise an impressive monster of a movie. Brody and Pearce are outstanding.

**Io Capitano** - 8/10

**Fremont** - 8/10 - I love movies that flow like light poems, like Petite Maman or Journey to A Mother's Room. It was a very sweet and cozy. The psychiatry sessions in particular were hilarious, and the bit where the diners are reading their fortunes in the restaurants were perfect. One of my favorite lines of the year is when the old lady fortune cookie writer dies at her desk, and the boss says “she was getting too old to write about the future anyway”. The lead and Jeremy Allen White were only onscreen together but their chemistry was infectious

**Seagrass** - 8/10

**LaRoy, Texas** - 8/10 - A hilariously-dark Coen Brothers throwback with wonderful performances from Steve Zahn and John Magaro (who I was lucky enough to meet prior to the screening). It's bloody and smart, and that's a rare combination.

**A Quiet Place: Day One** - 8/10

**The Last Showgirl** - 8/10 - Apart from a few awkward line-deliveries and questionable dialogue in spots, this was a very lowkey, engaging drama with a career-best performances from Pamela Anderson and Dave Bautista. Very dreamy and light.

**Friendship**	- 8/10 - It's so fucking stupid. Absolutely no plot to speak of. There's no character development. It's barely even a movie. It's basically a 90-minute sketch. All that being said, it's so goddamn hilarious. Non-stop laughs. Most I've laughed since Red Rocket probably. It's a can't-miss for any Tim Robinson fan and a can't-miss for any fans of laughing. Kate Mara was the perfect foil character. 

**The Wild Robot** - 8/10 - Yes, I cried, what of it?

**Relay** - 8/10 - A very solid, tight, throwback to the type of paranoid corporate-thrillers they don’t really make anymore. A super fun twist that I didn’t see coming at all, and a standout turn from Lily James. It slightly loses its way near the end.

**Good One** - 8/10 - Familiar and lowkey, but with a dark edge that slowly reveals itself, and a superb breakout role from Lily Collias. Great debut film from director India Donaldson.

**A Complete Unknown**	- 8/10 - There's definitely a lack of plot but at the end of the day we all just want to see Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits performed by a generational talent in Timothee Chalamet and it definitely delivers in that aspect.

**Midwives** - 8/10 - One of the more stressful movies I’ve seen in a while. My anxiety was through the roof, especially in the first half. It’s so realistic and graphic at times (and some of it *has* to be real, some birth scenes especially) that you almost get a sense that it’s a documentary. Totally nails the landing too, making you feel real anger/empathy about how Midwives are treated in France (and other places I assume).

**Hellbent On Boogie** - 8/10	

**Alien: Romulus** - 8/10 - Put Cailee Spaeny in anything and I'll watch it.

**Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga** - 8/10	

**The Old Oak** - 8/10 - British realism cinema at it's finest. Just another classic added to Ken Loach's resume.

**Longlegs** - 8/10	

**Babygirl** - 8/10	

**One Life** - 8/10 - I'm not a huge movie-cryer but I was absolutely balling my eyes out near the ""moment"". You know it's coming and it's still hit. Impressive when a movie can do that. Last movie that hit me like that was probably Tori and Lokita, and before that Moonlight. This was up there in terms of tears. Did not really expect it going in. Devasting. Anthony Hopkins kills these types of roles, he has a way of showing bottled up regret/sadness that not many others can.

**The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare** - 8/10 - Over-the-top violent fun time. Totally ridiculous but it doesn't take itself seriously and that's what keeps it from veering into. Also, Eiza Gonzalez. That is all.

**Strange Darling** - 8/10

**Los Frikis** - 8/10	

**Suncoast** - 8/10	

**Drive-Away Dolls** - 8/10 - I want more unapologetically horny movies like this. Loved all of Beanie Feldstein's bits and the slow, sleep-deprived descent into madness of the henchmen especially. Not too sure abou the weird-cheap transitions and trippy scenes though.  ""You're a day late and a penis short"" and ""Suki that's your wall dildo!"" are two of the funniest lines of the year, within context. Give me more fast-paced 75-minute movies.

**In A Violent Nature** - 8/10 -This made me feel physically nauseous several times, would strongly recommend. Some of the gnarliest kills I've ever seen on the big screen. 

**A Real Pain** - 8/10

**Abigail**- 8/10 - As a French-Canadian, big shoutout to Kevin Durand for his on-point Quebecois accent. Also, ""Sammy, those are fucking onions"" was one of the best/funniest line deliveries of the year. Really entertaining gory vampire flick. Dan Stevens is straight up having a fun time this year and I'm enjoying it every time. Melissa Barrera is now competing with with Mia Goth and Samara Weaving as top Scream Queens.

**Deadpool & Wolverine** - 8/10

**Bring Them Down** - 8/10 - I love me a slow-burn family feud drama that slowly snowballs into something dark and sinister. Christopher Abbott is one of my favorite working actors today and he does incredible work here, especially with the accent/Irish/body language. Disclaimer: Not recommended to people sensitive to animal violence/cruelty. There's a lot of that.

**The Piano Lesson** - 8/10 - As far as Denzel Washington-produced, August Wilson adaptations are concerned, this is way above *Fences*. Felt less like a straight-up filmed play. The supernatural element and amazing Danielle Deadwyler performance (give her an Oscar soon pls) make this more layered and interesting. Bonus: I was sitting with/near the cast/crew for this one, 5-10 feet away from Denzel/Danielle/John David/Malcolm/Corey Hawkins/Ray Fisher/Michael Potts. Amazing experience.

**Nickel Boys** - 8/10

**Fresh Kills** - 8/10 - A really solid mob-drama told from the perspective of a mob boss' daughter, which I appreciated. It's rare you see this story from that angle. Emily Bader's scene with her dad near the end. Holy. Fucking. Shit.

**Between The Temples** - 8/10 - Carol Kane was absolutely magnetic and a joy to watch in this, and Jason Schwartzman was her perfect endearing counter. Lovely movie, that makes you want to curl up into a ball and cringe to death near to end, in a good way. The most painful-to-watch family reunion/dinner since Shiva Baby. 

**Problemista** - 8/10 - I stand with Bank of America. Julio Torres is kind of a revelation in this. His facial expressions (and hilarious run-walk thing) are perfect. Absurd, funny, and sweet comedy with so much flair and uniqueness. Some fun little details that got good laughs out of me, like Tilda's character always having her phone light on. Chaotic in all of the right ways.

**Sisterhood**	- 8/10

**Days of Happiness** - 8/10

**The Apprentice** - 8/10 - It's not breaking any new ground but Sebastian Stan is a pleasure to watch transform into Trump as the movie goes on. Grimy and gross like the streets of New York in the 80s.

**Wil** - 8/10

**Naked Ambition: Bunny Yeager** - 8/10

**Soul** - 8/10 - I didn't get to catch this during it's original run due to COVID so I'm glad it came back. My favorite Pixar movie in a little while.

**Femme** - 8/10	

**I Saw the TV Glow** - 8/10 

**Heretic** - 7/10 - A fun horror with sharp dialogue and an incredibly-hammy Hugh Grant performance.

**Emilia Perez** - 7/10 - Some amazing musical numbers, especially the opener and ""El Mal"", and Zoe Saldana has an amazing performance where she carries the entire thing (Gomez and Gascon are getting lots of praise but I didn’t see it), but it just felt like it never fully came together to reach full potential.

**Mountains** - 7/10 - A very small and warm movie about the very big and cold issue of gentrification and the real estate crisis in South Florida. Monica Sorelle is a director to watch for sure.

**Skywalkers: A Love Story** - 7/10	- Other than a few moments that seemed a bit scripted (mostly the relationship drama), this is the most thriller documentary since Free Solo.

**Ghostlight** - 7/10	

**Shoshana** - 7/10 - Israeli true-life spy-thriller, a bit Bond-like. There's a few kills in here that are insanely brutal and the explosions/gunshots catch you by surprise. It had me jump a few times.

**The Dead Don't Hurt** - 7/10- Extremely slow, don't go in expecting an action-packed Western, but Viggo has a really good eye for beautiful backgrounds and settings. Vicky Krieps is top-tier as always. This movie doesn't work without her. I like slow Westerns.

**The Fall Guy** - 7/10	

**Thelma** - 7/10	

**Twisters** - 7/10 -Natural disaster flicks just work for me. Getting to look at Daisy Edgar-Jones for 2 hours never hurts as well.

**Cuckoo** - 7/10 - Insanely impressive and physical performance from Hunter Schafer. Cool visual style and flair, but ultimately dragged down by a total clusterfuck of a plot. I was confused throughout. Hilarious German accent from Dan Stevens

**Peak Season** - 7/10	

**Kneecap** - 7/10 - Some of the funniest one-liners of the year (""Look who it is, Bone Thugz and no harmony"", ""I feel like I discovered the Beatles, if the Beatles were shit.""). The whole RRAD storyline kept it from greatness though, that was a bit too goofy for its own good.

**Wolfs** - 7/10 - I went in wanting Pitt/Clooney banter and that's exactly what I got.

**Blink Twice** - 7/10	

**My Old Ass** - 7/10	

**Better Man** - 7/10	

**Nightbitch**	- 7/10 - Your mom's favorite movie of 2024. The awful first trailer didn't do it justice, this was solid, it just doesn't get dark like you'd hope it would.

**Out of Darkness**	- 7/10 - Saw this during a Mystery Movie Monday and was pleasantly surprised. Pretty brutal, atmospheric, and violent. Some cool overhead shots and a nice score. One of the better Mystery Movies I've seen.

**We Grown Now** - 7/10	

**The End We Start From** - 7/10	

**Kinds of Kindness** - 7/10 - Not the best Yorgos but deliciously-freaky and daring filmmaking nonetheless.

**Babes** - 7/10

**Fancy Dance** - 7/10	

**MaXXXine** - 7/10 - Definitely the weakest of the trilogy but still a solid slasher with a very interesting setting. Mia Goth has great moments like in the first two.

**Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1** - 7/10 - I don't care, the montage at the end was sick. I really hope Costner gets to fund as many of these as he wants.

**Wicked - 7/10** - Pretty good, not great. Ariana Grande was the standout. There were only 2 songs that were really catchy though, wish there were more.

**Juror #2** - 7/10

**Fly Me to the Moon** - 7/10	

**The End** - 7/10 - Gorgeously-shot, super well acted, beautiful set design and production, but way too long and had no reason to be a musical. The songs were all exactly the same and pointless and there much so much time in between that you would forget it was even a musical. George MacKay kills it.

**Being Maria** - 7/10	

**Cabrini** - 7/10 - Maybe a bit overlong but honestly not bad. Surprised it's from the same director as Sound of Freedom, it's quite a step up from that. Much larger and ambitious in scope, and the lead actress was really really great. It solidly panders to its intended audience but it’s well made enough that you can just gloss over the eye-rolling moments.

**In the Land of Saints and Sinners** - 7/10 - The best Neeson action-flick in a while, so that's something. Kerry Condon as the big villain was awesome. Need more of her in stuff.

**Y2K** - 7/10 - The single-funniest death scene of the year was the skateboard scene. Laughed so hard, made my night. Audience really dug this one too, good atmosphere. Fred Durst.

**The Queen of My Dreams** - 7/10 - I was getting massive Deja Vu with The Persian Version last year. Extremely similar story and vibe, equally fun/honest/heartfelt.

**Speak No Evil** - 7/10	

**Immaculate** - 7/10 - Sydney Sweeney stepping out of her comfort zone and doing a nun-horror is cool. Long take near the end was sick.

**Gladiator II** - 7/10 - Doesn't hold a candle to the original but it was still an entertaining sandals & swords story. Fred Hechinger is so awful in this though. Man, that took me out of it. 

**Back to Black** - 7/10 - This movie is conflicting. In a vacuum, ignoring Winehouse's actual story, it's a solid music-biopic carried by a powerhouse breakthrough performance from Marisa Abela and an amazing soundtrack (obviously). On the other hand, it's a disgusting whitewash by her estate to downplay her truly awful father. The fact that he had final approval over this movie, and will financially benefit from it, is just gross and hard to ignore. The 2015 documentary does a better job telling Amy's whole story in an emotional way, and that doc made my blood boil (and is one of my favorite docs ever). 

**Coup!** - 7/10	

**The Hypnosis** - 7/10	

**The Last Stop in Yuma County** - 7/10	

**Your Monster** - 7/10

**Blitz** - 7/10 - The cartoonish villains and improbably scenarios the kid kept finding himself in took this down a notch for me. Could've been great, but it didn't quite get there. How much bad shit can happen to one kid in 24 hours? Find out with Blitz. On a technical level it had a lot going for it though.

**In the Summers** - 7/10	

**Maria** - 7/10 - Jolie kills it and it looked gorgeous but a really big step down from Jackie/Spencer for Pablo Larrain, a big 'style over substance' movie and weirdly disrespectful to Jackie Kennedy as well for some odd reason. Very weird structure.

**Lost Soulz** - 7/10

**The Girls Are Alright** - 7/10

**All We Imagine As Light** - 7/10 - With all the hype I was expecting to be blown away. It was good but kind of a let down.

**Girls Will Be Girls** - 7/10	

**Ezra** - 7/10

**Young Woman and the Sea** - 7/10 - An inspiring sports-biopic with a very old-school and authentic feel. The Remember the Titans of swimming movies. It hits all of the cliches and it's super cheesy, but in all of the right ways. It just works. Daisy Ridley was great, and as far as swimming movies are concerned, it's definitely ahead of Nyad.

**Hundreds of Beavers** - 7/10 - It's funny and original, I just wish it was a bit shorter. Some of the bits definitely outstay their welcome after a while. I really like the grassroots campaign they've built around this movie though, everything from the independent theatrical showings to the support of physical media. A great success story for indie film this year.

**The Idea of You** - 7/10	

**Crossing** - 7/10

**Sleep** - 7/10	

**Monkey Man** - 7/10 - Solid action flick for the first and third acts, but dragged down by a super boring 2nd act (where it loses all of the momentum it built) and lots of sloppy/confusing editing, especially during chase sequences. Credit for the Terrence Malick-like flashback scenes with narration/sweeping music/shots of nature/etc, pretty cool to throw those into an action movie.

**The Color Purple** - 7/10	

**The Damned** - 7/10 - You're hanging out with the soldiers on the frontier of the American Civil War and almost nothing happens for the entire runtime except you learn about the characters and their thoughts on life/god/religion/etc. I enjoyed it.

**Mean Girls**	- 7/10	

**Driving Madelaine** - 7/10	

**Late Night with the Devil** - 7/10
	
**Snack Shack** - 7/10 - Aside from the needless death at the end that tries too hard to squeeze tears out of your eyeballs, I thought this was a fun, raunchy, summer-y throwback comedy. This would've been one of my favorites in middle school probably.

**Beetlejuice Beetlejuice** - 7/10	

**Joker: Folie a Deux** - 7/10	

**The Outrun** - 7/10 - Less a compelling story and more a showcase on Saoirse Ronan's acting abilities. The camera basically doesn't move from her for a single second and she completely carries it. She's the best.

**Flow** - 7/10

**Black Box Diaries** - 7/10	

**Queer** - 7/10

**The Return** - 7/10	

**New Life** - 7/10	- I really respect a movie that can pull off a wild genre-switch halfway through the movie. Went in fully blind so it was totally unexpected. Also impressive this tiny movie could license Bob Dylan’s Like A Rolling Stone (played a few times).

**Lisa Frankenstein** - 7/10  - The ultimate ""could've been truly great with a R rating"" movie.

**Bob Marley: One Love** - 7/10 - It does just enough to keep it out of the Super Generic Biopic Genre and any movie that can squeeze a few tears out of me gets an extra point. Sorry, that's just the rules.

**Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes** - 7/10	

**1992**- 7/10 - Other than Ray Liotta being written like a ridiculous cartoon villain and some eye-rolling dialogue issues, it actually was a pretty solid crime drama... and Tyrese Gibson was…good? (/r/brandnewsentence)

**French Girl** - 7/10	

**The Peasants** - 7/10 - Visually impressive and a sick score, but a schmaltzy/melodramatic story kinda kept it from the next level.

**The Monk and the Gun** - 7/10	

**Bad Boys: Ride or Die**	- 6/10	

**Seven Blessings**	- 6/10

**Knox Goes Away** - 6/10 - Michael Keaton does his best and commits but the writing & performance of every single side character brings the whole thing down a bit. The cop/ex-wife/son characters are bumbling, distractingly-dumb goofballs that keep the plot from ever grounding to reality, but it ultimately gets dark and violent enough to stay pretty entertaining. The script really could've used some more cleaning up.

**Trap** - 6/10 - Listen I have a lot (*a lot*) of problems with this movie but Kid Cudi randomly showing up for 5 minutes and randomly delivering insane lines like ""“I specifically said i wanted honey suckle kombucha biiiiitchhhh” made the trip to the theater worth it.

**Small Things Like These** - 6/10	

**Sometimes I Think About Dying** - 6/10	

**Kidnapped**	- 6/10	

**Asphalt City** - 6/10 - Standout performance from Tye Sheridan but this leaned a bit too much into misery porn for my liking. Every single day is the absolute worst day on the job. Extremely stress-inducing first hour. Mike Tyson being cast as the medic chief was certainly a choice...and it worked somehow?

**Eden**	- 6/10 - Had trouble getting past the awful accents and the sinking feeling that this was missed potential. I was at the World Premiere for this and someone in the audience had a medical emergency, they had to pause the screening and turn the lights on while the person was carried out on people's shoulders. Jude Law/Sydney Sweeney/Ana de Armas/Ron Howard were all there wondering what was going on. Kind of a crazy situation.

**Land of Bad** - 6/10	

**Unstoppable** - 6/10	

**Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire** - 6/10 - Skull Island's bland and less impressive/memorable little brother. Thumbs up for Baby Kong and the Rio de Janeiro destruction sequence, thumbs down for the lame story and unlimited amounts of annoying human characters.

**Bad Shabbos** - 6/10	

**Inside Out 2** - 6/10	

**Firebrand** - 6/10	

**A Different Man** - 6/10 - I didn't connect to this as much as most people did. Sebastian Stan is great as usual but the whole thing didn't do much for me.

**Love Me** - 6/10 - 10/10 for the attempt, 4/10 for the execution. There's a really good movie hidden in here somewhere, but there needed to be some cuts made to the animated portions of the film for sure.

**Shell**	- 6/10

**Housekeeping for Beginners** - 6/10	

**Totem** - 6/10

**The Fire Inside** - 6/10	

**Widow Clicquot**	- 6/10 - This starts off really really really slow but then finds its footing late and ends on a solid note. Career-best performance from Haley Bennett, she really carries this.

**Tuesday** - 6/10	

**Piece by Piece** - 6/10	

**The Cut** - 6/10 - Standout turns from Orlando Bloom and Caitriona Balfe, brought down by some weird editing choices. The neon-green hallucinations were a wild choice. I sat next to Katy Perry for this movie, AMA.

**Memoir of a Snail** - 6/10

**The Romano Twins** - 6/10	

**Mufasa: The Lion King** - 6/10
	
**Film Geek** - 6/10	

**Self-Reliance** - 6/10 - Pretty cute movie with a few laughs, but the ending lost its focus and felt rushed. The Andy Samberg bits were great. I wanted more from the relationship with Anna Kendrick's character, feels like there was more to explore there. ""This an intervention."" ""For me?"" ""No, we're just all facing the wrong direction.""

**Queen of the Ring** - 6/10	

**Coup de Chance**	- 6/10 - It's nowhere near peak-Woody Allen but it's a passable return to form since Rifkin's Festival, Wonder Wheel, and A Rainy Day In New York (all 3 awful, with Rifkin's Festival being rock bottom for Allen's filmography). The one thing it was missing was humor. I can always trust an Allen film to at least have a few funny/witty lines (even the bad ones), but this was very cut and dry. Could've used a few more good lines.

**Sasquatch Sunset** - 6/10 - I was excited for the premise and there's a few sweet/funny moments, but most of it ends up being mindless shitting/pissing/fucking. Credit for the unique idea and great views.

**Bird**	- 6/10 - One of the more disappointing films of the year. Even after the lukewarm reception at Cannes, I had super high hopes because I’m a huge Andrea Arnold fan, but the surrealism in this movie just didn’t work. It threw off the whole balance and wasn’t at all what I expected/wanted. Nikiya Adams and Barry Keoghan were both very solid, and the scene where the group sang Coldplay’s Yellow to the frog was amazing.

**Omni Loop**- 6/10	

**Here**	- 6/10 - A valiant attempt but ultimately kind of a hot mess. A few good moments keep it watchable. Some real uncanny valley shit in there too though.

**Queen Rock Montreal** - 6/10	

**Turning Red** - 6/10	

**Scrambled** - 6/10	

**The Book of Clarence** -  6/10 - LaKeith Stanfield was great and committed as usual (although I don't like twin dual-roles), and James McAvoy and Cumberbatch chewing on scenery was fun, this movie had a lot of trouble figuring out what it wanted to be. I really wish it leaned more into the funny/satire and less into the serious Mel Gibson/Jim Caviezel-type biblical drama. Cool that a movie like this can be made/funded and released in theaters though.

**Booger** - 6/10	

**Irena's Vow** - 6/10 - Great story, extremely generic period drama.

**A Great Divide** - 6/10	

**Riff Raff** - 6/10 - A bit outdated and mean-spirited, this would've slapped in 2006, but Bill Murray and Pete Davidson as the incompetent mob assassins makes it worth a watch. 

**Rosalie** - 6/10

**Skincare** - 6/10	

**Yellow Bus** - 6/10
	
**Arcadian** - 6/10 - It's fine and stretches its tiny budget so its absolute limit but it's basically a Dollar Store A Quiet Place. The monster design and animation was hilariously-bad though, like an Asylum knock-off movie. I'm also now convinced that Nic Cage is contractually obligated to have his face smothered in fake blood for any movie.

**Nutcrackers** - 6/10 

**The Invisibles** - 6/10
	
**Riley** -6/10	

**Rob Peace**	- 6/10 - A well-shot movie with great direction and performance from the supporting characters (Mary J Blige and Chiwetel Ejiofor) completely dragged down by an awful lead performance by Jay Will. Also the script was a bit silly, they were trying way too hard to make him 100% infallible.

**Christmas Eve in Miller's Point** - 6/10 - I liked the hectic atmosphere of the crazy Christmas family party that we've all been at, and the very scratchy look of the camera.

**Rumours** - 6/10 - I can appreciate what Maddin was going for, and there's some moments that work (mostly with Cate Blanchett and Charles Dance, they were awesome), but overall surreal-absurd-fantasy-comedy like this just doesn't work for me.

**Fallen Fruit** - 6/10	

**Birthrite** - 6/10	

**Crumb Catcher** - 6/10	

**Anselm** - 6/10	

**Scapegoat** - 6/10	

**Seeds** - 5/10 - There’s clearly heart and maybe a great movie in here somewhere, but it’s such a tonal mess that it’s hard to find anything to love.

**Sujo** - 5/10	

**The Beekeeper** - 5/10 - This is the Rebel Moon of Jason Bourne movies. A few cool kills and classic Statham one-liners keep it from being a total loss, but it's not very good.

**Unsung Hero** - 5/10

**Jeanne du Barry**- 5/10	

**Treasure** - 5/10

**A Sacrifice** - 5/10	

**The American Society of Magical Negroes** - 5/10 - All over the place and it gave a constant feeling of ""missed opportunity"" (a la Book of Clarence). Justice Smith is straight-up not a convincing lead. An-Li Bogan was the standout, and I saw her end twist coming from a mile away so I got that going for me which is nice.

**La Syndicaliste** - 5/10

**Sonic the Hedgehog 3** - 5/10	

**The Watchers** - 5/10

**Borderlands** - 5/10 - Went in expecting a 1/10, got a 5/10. Nice. Life is all about the little wins.

**Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire** - 5/10 - Just give this franchise a permanent rest. It wasn't awful in any particular way, but it was totally soulless and heartless. It felt like nobody really gave a shit except Kumail Nanjiani. Safe, sanitized, studio slop. They couldn't even fully commit to the one interesting thing (the gay ghost love story).

**National Anthem** - 5/10	

**The 4:30 Movie**	- 5/10 - Kevin Smith jerking himself off for 80 minutes. Would make a fun double-feature with *Snack Shack* though.

**Universal Language** - 5/10 - This had a lot of hype of out Cannes and it's Canada's submission for the Oscars so I had a lot of hope, but it just didn't do much for me. Surreal-absurdism just isn't my cup of tea. The only real standout scene was the one with the Quebec democrat. A rare case of the Q&A being more interesting than the movie itself.

**Kraven the Hunter** - 5/10	

**Time Still Turns the Pages** - 5/10	

**Upgraded** - 5/10	- Basically a Great Value The Devil Wears Prada. Good as rom-com-background-nois. Marissa Tomei is awful in this. One of the worst performances of the year.

**Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot** - 5/10	

**Out of Season** - 5/10	

**Miller's Girl** - 5/10	

**Latin for All** - 5/10	

**Argylle** - 5/10 - How a movie like The Creator can be made for $80M but something so awful-looking like this needs $200M blows my mind. 

**I.S.S.** - 5/10 - I love a good sandwich-making climax as much as the next guy, but what a painfully awkward ending. The first 25 minutes made me think something decent could be happening then it derails hard and never recovers. The worst thing to happen to the space program since Challenger.

**Get Away** - 5/10	

**Brothers** - 5/10	

**Life's a Bitch** - 5/10 - France's (bad) answer to Yorgos Lanthimos. A dry, twisted, gross, weirdly-sexual, anthology film with a lot less nudity but a lot more dogs than Kinds of Kindness. Kinda loses its way comedically and becomes a chore after the first chapter.

**Azrael** - 5/10	

**Monster Summer** - 5/10 - Like a G-rated IT, with Mel Gibson for some reason (?)

**Kung Fu Panda 4** - 5/10	

**Garfield** - 5/10

V**illains, Inc** - 5/10 - It had a certain cheap charm but an overwhelming sense of ""SNL Digital Short sketch stretched way too thin"".

**Excursion** - 5/10	

**Sleeping Dogs** -  5/10

**Notice to Quit** - 5/10 - The kid actor was really good but I'm just a bit over following an extremely unlikeable lead around doing shitty things to people.

**Reunion** - 5/10

**The Boy in the Woods**	- 5/10	

**Paradise** - 5/10	

**Karaoke** - 5/10	

**It Ends With Us**	- 5/10	

**Poolman** - 4/10 - The ugly, boring,  confused lovechild of Inherent Vice and Under the Silver Lake.

**Avenue of the Giants** - 4/10	

**Arthur the King** - 4/10 - Marky Mark has really devolved as an actor honestly, really tough performance from him here. It's like he's completely forgotten how to convincingly deliver lines. Right from the GoPro scenes at the beginning I knew it was gonna be a rough time. This movie is like 85% exposition.

**Janet Planet** - 4/10 - Bookended by 2 great scenes, but filled with mostly pointless garbage.

**Dandelion**	- 4/10	

**By the Stream** - 4/10	- I enjoy Hong Sangsoo movies in very small doses. This dose was just way too big.

**Venom: The Last Dance** - 4/10	

**Red One** - 4/10	

**Oh, Canada** - 4/10 - Dreadfully confusing, and Jacob Elordi puts in one of the worst performances of the year, but at least that Phosphorescent soundtrack kept me engaged. 

**Slingshot** - 4/10	

**Adios Buenos Aires** - 4/10	

**Humane** - 4/10	

**Some Other Woman** - 4/10	

**My Daughter, My Love** - 4/10	

**Madame Web** - 4/10 - Slop.

**IF** - 4/10 - Not really for adults, not really for kids/teens. Who was this movie even for?...

**Freud's Last Session** - 4/10	

**Werewolves** - 4/10 - So much lens flare. I am now blind.

**Ramona at Midlife** - 4/10	

**The Last Front** - 4/10	

**My Penguin Friend** - 4/10
	
**Augure** - 4/10	

**Which Brings Me To You** - 4/10 - Looking back over this ranking, I'm gonna be honest and say I have no idea what this was. Don't remember. To producers out there: please stop making your movie titles random vague sentences.

**Mai** - 4/10	

**Meanwhile on Earth** - 4/10	

**Lizzie Lazarus** - 4/10	

**Or Something** - 4/10	

**The Way We Speak** - 4/10	

**Cult Killer** - 3/10 - Antonio Banderas shows up for like 5 minutes and then nopes the fuck out. Total paycheck movie.

**The Feeling that the Time for Doing Something Has Passed** - 3/10 - There were some funny lines (especially the 9/11 dating profile bit) but this was so painfully dry and slow that I could never really connect. If desert-dry, awkward, deadpan delivery, with an absurd amount of BDSM-sex-stuff thrown in is your thing, you might find a few things to like. I could not.

**Never Let Go** - 3/10	

**The Throwback** - 3/10	

**The City** - 3/10	

**Rats!**	- 3/10 - This would've worked well as an edgy Youtube short in 2012.

**The Best Christmas Pageant Ever** - 3/10	

**He Went That Way** - 3/10 - Half roadtrip comedy with a chimp, half brutal serial killer drama. Tonally all over the place. The kind of movie you'd expect Jacob Elordi to try to bury (a la Dicaprio with Don's Plum) and fire his agent over before it sees the light of way. Baffling decisions made by everyone here. 

**Megalopolis** - 2/10 - I went in expecting a mess but I was still not prepared for how bad this was. It’s Neil Breen with an unlimited budget. It felt like 6 hours. It looked so cheap and awful. A mix of Lifetime movie and a middle school play. I refuse to believe it’s bad on purpose for comedy. The only thing keeping this from a 1 is that Adam Driver/Coppola/Nathalie Emmanuel/Giancarlo Esposito were at my screening for Q&A (god bless their sweet little souls for having to seriously promote this hot mess). ""What do you think of this boner I got right here?” is a line 85 year old Jon Voight actually says in a real movie in the year of our lord 2024. My therapist will hear about this.

**A Boy Who Dreamt of Electricity** - 2/10	

**Isle of Hope** - 2/10 - Sometimes I wonder why I do this to myself.

**Chosen Family** - 1/10	- This was borderline unfinished and full-on embarrassing. The production value of a daytime soap opera mixed in with the sound editing of a local high school play. It's impressive how much filler (drone shots of surrounding neighborhood) can be squeezed into 84 minutes of movie. Sitting a few seats away from Heather Graham was a nice bonus (with Q&A), but it couldn't come close to making up for this disaster.

gladiator,gladiator movie,1hlklsk,Troy is the worst adaptation of the Iliad,"The epic story of Homer is twisted in the most extraordinary way.

The producers/directors, whoever,  most probably have not read the whole Iliad.

Troy had so much potential; action, romance, greed, jealousy, a great setting and story, and yet everything was completely screwed up. What's more, they altered everything that was originally part of the myth; Agammemnon died at his wife's hands on returning home after conquering Troy, Achilles was dead long before the horse entered the city gates, and Ajax hung himself as opposed to being killed by Hector. On top of this, the battle scenes were unambitious and pedestrian, marred by the incessant Gladiator-esque waling music used in the background. The dialogue was laughable in the first five minutes until it became evident that it would continue like this for a further two and a half hours.

The screenwriters fell into a cheap manichaeism and with caricatured characters, they did not know how to create extremely complex characters in a dispute for power like Octavian and Mark Antony. Instead of making Hagamemnon a complex character like Octavian in Rome, the film turned him into a villain from Marvel movies. And the ending comes with a huge facilitation instead of accepting a tragic ending for Paris and Helen (since they changed the story) as it was with Mark Antony and Cleopatra in Rome. The two lovers escaped in an unconvincing way that would never happen in practice.

gladiator,gladiator movie,1hljefx,Is Ridley Scott the best living director of horses?," *Robin Hood*, *Gladiators 1 & 2*, *Kingdom of Heaven*, *Napoleon*, and *The Last Duel* were all made in the second part of Scott’s career and they all feature extremely impressive equestrianism on sometimes massive scale. 

Even considering that he is aided by modern digital technologies, I feel like you have to go back to the days of John Ford and David Lean before any decent comparison.

If the movie has a book that would be nice (but don’t mention Harry Potter or Twilight). I also like movies like Gladiator.

gladiator,gladiator 2000,1i51yul,Was 2000-09 an exceptional decade for movies?,"I’ve been rewatching a lot of movies from that time period and I’m curious if it’s my nostalgia for when I was growing up making me think it was truly an exceptional span, or if there was something magical happening. 

To briefly summarize: 

* 2000: Gladiator, Memento, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Almost Famous, American Psycho, The Patriot, O Brother, Where Art Thou?
* 2001: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, Shrek, A Beautiful Mind, Donnie Darko, Spirited Away, The Royal Tenenbaums
* 2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Spider-Man, The Bourne Identity, Catch Me If You Can, Signs, City of God
* 2003: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Finding Nemo, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Lost in Translation, X2: X-Men United, The Last Samurai
* 2004: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Incredibles, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Spider-Man 2, Mean Girls, The Aviator, Shaun of the Dead

* 2009: Avatar, Inglourious Basterds, The Hangover, Up, The Hurt Locker, Zombieland, District 9

I mean just look at 2007..!

However, I suspect if you pick any 10-year span in modern movie history you can come up with a similarly impressive list?

On the contrary – it was also the golden age of CGI and brought two of the most successful film franchises in history – Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter – to the screen. 

Curious what other opinions are. ",170,210,1737303181.0,2025-01-19 16:13:01,False
gladiator,gladiator 2000,1hzt7h8,Adam Driver collects great directors like Pokemon,"It's pretty clear to me that Driver's philosophy is that if he works with amazing directors, he's going to improve his chances of being in great movies and improve his craft.  While it doesn't always work out and he sometimes has small roles, for the most part it does seem to pay off.

**Additional Thoughts**

* **Flops:** It's interesting that some of the biggest duds Driver has been involved in also happen to be from some of the greatest directors past their prime.  Coppolla's ""Megalopolis"", Gilliam's ""Man who Killed Don Quixote"", Ridley Scott's ""House of Gucci"" a few examples, but if the idea is to soak up everything you can from the greatest to ever do it, your opportunities to work with legends in their mid-80s are limited.
* **Future Targets:**  I imagine there certain consistently panned directors, like Zack Snyder (average metacritic score in the 40s with peak being 59/100), that he'd want to avoid, but I'd take a wild guess that Driver's agent has an open call to directors like Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, Denis Villenueve, etc that's like ""Hey... my boy is ready when you are"".  Who do you guess is at the top of his wish list?
* **Driver a Future Director?:** I don't know if he's ever expressed an interest in making his own projects, but it would be difficult to find someone who has worked on films with that many incredible directors.  You have to imagine he's learned a lot.  That's like the world's greatest filmmaking masterclass.  He kinda owes it to everyone to give directing a shot at some point.",1116,270,1736706436.0,2025-01-12 18:27:16,False
gladiator,gladiator 2000,1hcbh9j,Considering Ridley Scott has been involved with sequels to all his classic movies. Will Legend get a remake/Sequel?,"Got me thinking with Gladiator II. Ridley has been involved with the Recent Romulus movie, after we directed Alien (1979) he obviously directed Covenant and Promethous. So thats Alien Checkboxed. We got a sequel to Bladerunner (1982) with Bladerunner 2049. Though he was a producer on that. Now we have a sequel to his Gladiator movie which came out in 2000. 

I'm surprised he hasn't had a itch to remake or continue Legend (1985) Since it was his forth movie he did. 


Or is this just wishful thinking on my part?

To say that it was a great Thanksgiving weekend would be selling it short.

***Moana 2*** surpassed every expectation and delivered a record-breaking debut for the Thanksgiving weekend. And with the aid of ***Wicked*** and ***Gladiator II***, it was the busiest weekend of the year.

The Top 10 earned a combined $269.2 million this weekend ($412.8 million five-day). That's not just a colossal 210% up from last year, but it's also the biggest Thanksgiving weekend ever.

Debuting on top, ***Moana 2*** earned a colossal $139.7 million in 4,200 theaters. Adding its numbers from Wednesday, the debut rises to $225.4 million in five days. It broke so many records, including the biggest debut for a Walt Disney Animation Studios film debut, as well as the highest Thanksgiving weekend. But most importantly; it beat ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** ($204.6 million) for the biggest Wednesday-to-Sunday debut. 

A fantastic debut all around, and it shouldn't be a surprise. If you've followed the Top 10 charts on streaming, you'll find that ***Moana*** has been one of the most streamed films in the past years. It was even reported that it was the most streamed film across all services last year. Needless to say, ***Moana*** became far more popular with years, and audiences hoped for a sequel to come.

Disney, for some reason, was interested in doing it but only as a TV show for Disney+. In February 2024, it was revealed that the show was retooled into a film that would hit theaters this Thanksgiving. With an extensive marketing campaign, Disney successfully got people into giving this film a chance. 

According to Disney, 65% of the audience was female, and 60% was 18 and over. Critics were not enthused with the film, and it currently sits at 64% on RT. The audience was more forgiving, giving it an ""A–"" on CinemaScore, although that falls on the lower end of WDAS titles. There are no animated titles on its way until ***Dog Man*** in January, so it can leg out through the holidays. $500 million is pretty much guaranteed, and can go as high as $600 million if it can hold very well.

After defying gravity on its opening weekend, ***Wicked*** continued flying high. It earned $81.1 million this weekend ($118.2 million five-day). That marks an insane 28% drop, which breaks the record set by ***Top Gun: Maverick*** (29%) as the smallest drop for a $100+ million opener. Of course, ***Maverick*** achieved that record on the weekend after Memorial Day, but it didn't face a $100+ million opener on its second weekend.

Through ten days, ***Wicked*** has earned a colossal $263.1 million domestically. It's already the highest grossing Broadway musical adaptation, passing ***Grease*** ($188 million). Of course, ***Grease*** is still ahead in terms of adjusted inflation ($770 million), but ***Wicked*** remains a colossal success. It should hit $400 million without any problem, and the holidays can help it get close to $500 million by the end of its run.

Paramount's ***Gladiator II*** added $31 million this weekend. That represents a 44% drop, which is fine, but not fantastic considering how well the other holdovers did. Through 10 days, Ridley Scott's sequel has earned $111.4 million, passing ***Robin Hood*** and ***Black Hawk Down*** to become Scott's 6th highest grossing film domestically. The film should finish with over $150 million domestically, quite down from the original's $187 million lifetime gross.

After a steep second weekend drop, Amazon MGM's ***Red One*** eased a light 4%, adding $12.7 million this weekend. The film has earned $75.8 million so far, and depending on next week's drop, it could still hit $100 million. Although it's hard to call this a bonafide hit considering its colossal $250 million budget.

Lionsgate's ***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** was still on the Top 5, easing just 6% and adding $3.2 million. The film has earned $31.9 million domestically.

In sixth place, Angel Studios' ***Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin*** fell 54% and added $2.3 million this weekend ($3.3 million five-day). That's a very weak drop, especially considering it had Thanksgiving. Through ten days, the film has amassed $9.6 million and will close with less than $15 million.

***Venom: The Last Dance*** is still holding well, dipping 43% this weekend and adding $2.2 million. The film has amassed $137.8 million so far, which is still far behind the previous ***Venom*** films.

A24's ***Heretic*** continues falling. This weekend, it fell 57% and added $956K this weekend. With $26.8 million in the bank, it's now gonna finish below $30 million.

In the face of ***Moana 2***, DreamWorks' ***The Wild Robot*** had its worst drop yet. It collapsed 67% this weekend, adding $700,000 to its run. The film has earned $142.5 million, and it's nearing the end of its run.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Searchlight's ***A Real Pain***, which recovered after its weak drop last weekend. The film dipped 39%, grossing $655,910 this weekend. The film has earned just $6.1 million, and barring some huge Oscar noms, it looks like it might miss $10 million.

Outside the Top 10 was Focus Features' ***Conclave***, which dipped 46% and earned $616,955 this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $30.1 million domestically. A damn great run for an adult drama.

Neon's ***Anora*** is winding down, and it's now playing in just 230 theaters. This weekend, it dipped 43% and added $385,292. Its domestic total stands at $12.7 million.

A24 debuted Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer*** in 7 theaters, earning $188,808. That translates to a $26,973 per-theater average, which is quite middling (it barely cracks the top 20 highest PTA of the year). For comparison, it's barely above ***Bones and All*** ($24,201), and far below ***Suspiria*** ($92,019) and ***Call Me By Your Name*** ($103,233). The film will continue expanding through the holidays.

#**OVERSEAS**

The records don't stop just in America for ***Moana 2***.

***Moana 2*** debuted with a colossal $163 million overseas, which means it debuted with $389.2 million worldwide. That broke ***Mario***'s record ($377 million) for the biggest animated debut in history. The biggest markets were France ($18.8M), UK ($15.5M), Mexico ($11.1M), Germany ($10.5M), Italy ($9.3M), South Korea ($9.1M), Australia ($8.3M), Brazil ($7.5M), China ($6.5M) and Spain ($5.5M). An easy billion right here, ladies and gentlemen. 

***Wicked*** is a monster hit domestically, but that popularity hasn't fully connected with the rest of the world. This weekend, the film earned $29 million from the overseas markets, taking the worldwide total to $360.3 million. It's still killing it in the UK ($36M) and Australia ($12.9M), and it has performed well in South Korea ($8.5M), Mexico ($6.7M), and Philippines ($3.5M). The rest of the markets... not so much. While it still has some markets left, the film will be domestic-heavy. The film is cleary a hit, but it's crazy how the domestic market represents a huge 73% of its worldwide gross.

***Gladiator II*** added $27.2 million this weekend, and its worldwide total is now $320.2 million. The best markets are the UK ($29.7M), France ($22.5M), Spain ($15M), Mexico ($12.9M) and Australia ($11.5M). The film should pass the original's $272 million foreign gross, but it's unlikely it can pass its worldwide gross ($460 million).

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Beetlejuice Beetlejuice* | Sep/6 | Warner Bros. | $111,003,345 | $294,100,435 | $450,053,961 | $100M
*Saturday Night* | Sep/27 | Sony | $3,400,583 | $9,509,312 | $9,752,378 | $25M
*Terrifier 3* | Oct/11 | Cineverse | $18,928,113 | $53,981,071 | $94,436,616 | $2M

- 36 years in the making and it paid off, as ***Beetlejuice Beetlejuice*** closed with a fantastic $294 million domestically, finishing as Burton's second highest grossing film, just a little behind ***Alice in Wonderland*** ($334 million). Interestingly, that popularity wasn't as strong overseas, as the domestic market represented 65.3% of its worldwide gross. It's still a great $450 million worldwide, although ***Alice*** ($1 billion) and ***Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*** ($474 million) finished far higher. Despite a few duds here and there, Tim Burton is still as popular as he's ever been.

- ***Saturday Night Live*** might be popular 50 years later, but that doesn't mean the audience is interested in a film depicting its first ever broadcast. That was the case for Jason Reitman's ***Saturday Night***, which closed with a very poor $9.5 million domestically. The film was positioned as an Oscars contender, but the film fizzled out by the time it hit wide release and faded quickly. Don't expect the rest of the world to save it, given that ***Saturday Night Live*** isn't as popular as the States. 

- Last month, we had two movies revolving around a clown as its protagonist. ***Joker: Folie à Deux*** became one of the worst received comic book films of all time, allowing Art the Clown to emerge as the winner of the month. And now, ***Terrifier 3*** has closed with a damn fantastic $94 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing unrated film ever. Shattered the ceilling of what a film like this could achieve, and elevating Art to one of the most iconic horror villains of modern times. Damien Leone has already confirmed a fourth film is coming up. Art in space when?

#**THIS WEEKEND**

The post-Thanksgiving weekend is usually a dumping ground for studios. With the Christmas season kicking off, people are busy, which is why studios avoid releasing anything big. It's up to the small films to get a chance. This weekend, we have two newcomers and none of them stand a chance in dethroning ***Moana 2***. None will even touch $10 million this weekend.

The only one with a confirmed wide release is A24's ***Y2K***, which marks Kyle Mooney's debut as writer and director. The film stars Jaeden Martell, Julian Dennison, Rachel Zegler, Fred Durst, and Alicia Silverstone, and depicts an imaginative version of the Year 2000 problem, where a bug causes all technology to come to life and turn against humanity. The film has received mixed reviews (63% on RT), and horror comedies have not performed well as of late. We'll see how it does, but a debut under A24's ***Heretic*** ($10.8 million) seems pretty much imminent.

The other film, although in far less theaters, is Searchlight's ***Nightbitch***. A film that stars Amy Adams as a mother who transforms into a dog. Like, seriously. Y'all complain about lack of originality in Hollywood? Well, here's a very unique premise. Reviews are quite similar to ***Y2K***, and marketing has been very limited so far. This suggests it won't be a very wide release.

And for those curious, Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** is returning to theaters this Friday for a limited time on IMAX screens. You should hurry up, for screenings are quickly getting sold out.

gladiator,gladiator 2000,1gvbprd,Gladiator (2000) does nothing for me,"Utterly a fun film that lacks anything to grab onto. Pretty one dimensional all around, with a strong finale. Choppily edited, screenplay is a mess and feels rushed (learning the bts makes this make sense). All around just an okay movie that I think my lack of liking is accentuated by the fact it’s considered a classic and won best picture. Most if not all action scenes and muddled down by horrible editing, and the real crux of the film feels very rushed, ie the scene when he finds his wife and child murdered.

gladiator,gladiator 2000,1gpxhp7,"Is Ridley Scott's Gladiator II really just a shadow of its predecessor, as many critics say, or is this just the usual gripe of fans of the 2000 film?","https://preview.redd.it/aj5jeefxoj0e1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=933c5ceb204778b734fdbba185fcc217d9d83e2c

Reading the reviews, it is impossible not to notice that the film is compared to Gladiator at every turn, thus allowing it to fall short in the comparison. I see the mechanical nature of human thinking reflected in the fact that the second part has to rise above the first part by standing on exactly the same pillars as the first part. I wonder how critics would assess the film if they did not put it on a par with the first part, but saw it as a film in its own right, without precedent? I wonder how many ""second parts"" or ""third parts"" in the history of cinema have failed because they fell victim to this comparison?  What do you think? Does a first part impose an obligation on the creators of a second part to rise above it in every respect, or are they worthy of being seen by critics as a work in their own right?",0,21,1731450634.0,2024-11-12 22:30:34,False

gladiator,gladiator 2000,1g01w7a,"What are, in your opinion, the top 5 most essential action movies released in the past 30 years? ","What are the 5 action movies released since 1994 that practically revitalized the genre for you? 

Here's mine: 

Gladiator (2000). I chose this one because it balanced political drama and kick-ass action sequences perfectly. 

The Bourne Identity (2002). I included this one because it's not an end of the world kind of high stakes action film. It's basically just this guy trying to figure out who he is. And it has some awesome action sequences (particularly the car chase and the apartment fight).

The Dark Knight (2008). I included this one because it's one of the most human superhero movies you'll ever come across. Another reason for its inclusion is that it might have some of the best-staged action scenes of all time. 

Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). I chose this one for a different reason than the ones listed above. I included it because the plot is extremely simple, and it just leaves room for George Miller to fucking cook with those massive action sequences.

Mission: Impossible- Fallout (2018). I wanted this one on the list because of the stunt-driven, practical action. It's spectacular. ",0,56,1728507267.0,2024-10-09 21:54:27,False

I, myself, am strongly considering a career in film at some point. These movies are my personal favorites and also my main sources of inspiration for my future filmography in terms of writing, cinematography, and directing. I love these works with all my heart and many of them are made by some of my favorite directors (e.g. Jonathan Demme, David Fincher, Michael Mann, Steven Spielberg, Quentin Tarantino, and the Coens). Three of these films won Best Picture at the Academy Awards, and three more were nominated in the same category, which goes to show how outstanding they are.

Anyways, I wanted to hear what you think my ten favorites say about my movie tastes in general. If you think there are any other movies that are similar to these, I would be very happy to hear recommendations. The main reason that I'm so eager to hear your answers is so I can see what type of movies I'd be the best at making based on my overall preferences. If I do stuff in the industry (hypothetically, *if* I'm lucky enough), I want to know what I would be good at.",0,40,1722701514.0,2024-08-03 17:11:54,False

gladiator,gladiator 2000,1e1z0r6,"The ""Battle Royale"" trope: a fight to the death until only one survives","Battle Royale isn't the first work of fiction based on the idea of a group of people being forced to fight each other in a closed arena until only one survives, but it seems to have become synonymous with the trope in discussions about movies and other works of fiction with a similar premise.

What's your favorite version of this basic premise and why? The aforementioned Japanese movie from 2000? Any of the Hunger Games movies? Or The Belko Experiment?

Does The Running Man count? Or Squid Game? Or Circle? How about Gladiator or any other gladiator film? None of these titles fit the description of the basic premise perfectly, but are they similar enough to constitute as variations of the trope?",0,9,1720836268.0,2024-07-13 03:04:28,False

gladiator,gladiator 2000,1crubhu,"What historical person, time period or event desperately needs a ""definitive"" movie?","There are so many great movies that shaped my vision of what a certain historical person, event or general time period looked like. Some examples would be how Kingdom of Heaven (2005) depicted the crusades, Lincoln (2012) for Abraham Lincoln, Saving Private Ryan (1998) for WW2 and Gladiator (2000) for the Roman Empire. I'm well aware that those aren't 100% historically accurate, but I'd say they did a damn good job at visualizing what that time period looked like.

What would be your top pick for any historical subject that needs a definitive movie: One that makes everyone go ""Finally somebody nailed it, now we don't need another (subject) movie for the next 20 years.""",346,1015,1715698934.0,2024-05-14 16:02:14,False
gladiator,gladiator 2000,1cmlseu,I watched and ranked all 96 Best Picture Oscar winners.,"I was watching the movie Babylon toward the end of 2023 and started to wonder about what movies were popular at that time in America. After looking at the list of best picture winners and nominees back to 1928, I realized I had seen very few of them. After renting a few of the early winners, I decided to keep going and watch the whole list. I watched them in a completely random order, first so I wouldn’t disadvantage the early years, and second because I was dependent upon the library.  I paid very little to do this and requested almost all of them through the Columbus Library. It took about 6 months to complete.

These are my rankings. I initially used tiers for categories before I started to individually rank. These are my opinions, and I would not change many of them by more than a few positions. Others would probably come up with very different lists. The 1970s and the 1990s were notably excellent film periods.

I am considering a few other lists to spin off from this, like less popular hidden gems or movies that should have won. One thing that shocked me was how often subjects that I considered modern issues came up in these older movies. For example: addiction in The Lost Weekend, Antisemitism in Gentlemen’s Agreement, Indigenous discrimination in Cimmaron, and political intimidation riots in All The King’s Men (gave me Jan 6 flashbacks). Somethings were poorly portrayed, and there is obviously rampant racism in some movies, but overall, it gave me a greater respect for American cinema and overall movie history.

Update 1: I appreciate all the comments, good and bad. I didn't expect this much of a response so it was exciting to see. The only things I disagree with are the comments saying never to watch certain things. This is all art, it's meant to be viewed, good or bad.

I tried to fix the weird formatting, the original draft definitely did not look like that, so I was surprised after I submitted.  

There are a couple movies I want to go back and watch again; Ordinary People, Amadeus, Forest Gump, and On The Waterfront.  Maybe I missed something with these and need to look again. I still think Oppenheimer was a great movie, and Nomadland wasn't.  Not budging on these ones.

I have nothing against Moonlight, it was heartbreaking to watch the loneliness that kept following him every step.  I just didn't like the ending and was hoping for something more definitive and it seemed anticlimactic to me.",785,648,1715113717.0,2024-05-07 21:28:37,False

gladiator,gladiator 2000,1bevybw,The film industry has fallen off - a comparison of Best Picture winners from 2001-2010 and 2015-2024.,"This is the list of Best Pictures (Oscars) from 2010 to 2001:

* ""The Hurt Locker"" (2009)
* ""Slumdog Millionaire"" (2008)
* ""No Country for Old Men"" (2007)
* ""The Departed"" (2006)
* ""Crash"" (2005)
* ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004)
* ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" (2003)
* ""Chicago"" (2002)
* ""A Beautiful Mind"" (2001)
* ""Gladiator"" (2000)

Now compare that with the list from 2024 to 2015:

* ""Oppenheimer"" (2023)
* ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" (2022)
* ""CODA"" (2021)
* ""Nomadland"" (2020)
* ""Parasite"" (2019)
* ""Green Book"" (2018)
* ""The Shape of Water"" (2017)
* ""Moonlight""(2016)
* ""Spotlight"" (2015)
* ""Birdman"" (2014)

The discrepancy is insane.

Take the Departed for example. Does any move from the 2015-2024 list even compare to the Departed? Or Gladiator? Or Hurt Locker? I know that for a lot of us these movies benefit from nostalgia but even from an objective standpoint these two lists are like night and day to me. Oppenheimer was GOOD but was it Best Picture worthy? No way. It just happened to not have any competition.

TLDR; Movies were better in the 2000s and early 2010s compared to now. Whether this is due to randomness or an actual decline in movie quality is up for debate.

EDIT: What is actually interesting is a lot of people are saying my taste seems to be more ""graphic/violent"". This may be true. What is also true is the Oscars has worked very hard to diversify its judges and pool of movies. There is a possibility that movies (ie Departed, Hurt Locker, No Country for Old Men etc) that only spoke to older white males (for reference I am not white but am male) might have won in the past and now many more types of movies are winning.",0,41,1710450124.0,2024-03-14 21:02:04,False
gladiator,gladiator 2000,1bbryq9,The 2000’s is a wildly looked-over decade for film,"I was having a conversation with a fellow movie buff at work today, discussing the best decades for film. I mentioned I thought the 2000’s is arguably one of the best, and possibly my favorite. He was shocked. I consistently see people passing over this decade when having this discussion and I believe it is mostly due to the saturation of teen comedies the decade is well-known for; Mean Girls, Superbad, Old School, etc. But this decade has SO much more to offer. I’d love to hear other’s thoughts on here and point out some of my favorites from this overlooked decade. 

Starting out, I’d like to list films specifically from what I consider to be one of the best years in film history- 2007. I’ve been hard-pressed to find another year (from any decade) that has as many heavy-hitters as this single year does. I’m not saying EVERY entry in this list is great, but I at least enjoy each one listed here:

There Will Be Blood (possibly my fav film of all time), No Country for Old Men, Zodiac, American Gangster, Into the Wild, I Am Legend, 300 (advertised as 06’, but majorly released in 07’), The Bourne Ultimatum, The Darjeeling Limited, 3:10 to Yuma, The Assassination of Jesse James, The Great Debaters, Michael Clayton, Oceans Thirteen, We Own the Night, Shooter, Death Proof, Fracture, 30 Days of Night, Disturbia, Paranormal Activity, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, August Rush, Surf’s Up, Ratatouille, Meet the Robinsons, The Simpsons Movie, Bee Movie, Transformers, Spider-Man 3, Stardust, Atonement, Flawless, The Bucket List, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, Hairspray, Sweeney Todd, Superbad, Hot Rod, Death at a Funeral, Rocket Science, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, Knocked Up, Dan in Real Life, Juno

Other films from across the 2000’s that contribute to the greatness of the decade: 

The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Departed, Kill Bill (1&2), Inglorious Bastards, Collateral, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Casino Royale, Children of Men, Avatar, Gladiator, The Last Samurai, Gangs of New York, Training Day, The Bourne (Identity - Ultimatum), Oceans 11/12/13, The Pursuit of Happyness, Sin City, The Hurt Locker, Remember the Titans, Requiem for a Dream, Burn After Reading, Tropic Thunder, Borat, Napoleon Dynamite, Mystic River, Blood Diamond, Gran Torino, The Prestige, O Brother Where Art Thou?, Inside Man, The Wrestler, District 9, Catch Me If You Can, Up in the Air, Walk the Line, The Italian Job

Also worth mentioning is the fantastic run of animated films released by Disney, DreamWorks, etc. during this time: 

The Emperor’s New Groove, Atlantis: The Lost Empire, Monsters Inc., Shrek, Treasure Planet, Finding Nemo, Brother Bear, Surf’s Up, Meet the Robinsons, Kung Fu Panda, The Incredibles, Cars, Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up

I’m sure there are many films I’ve failed to mention or haven’t seen yet but these are what come to mind at the moment.",0,30,1710122985.0,2024-03-11 02:09:45,False

gladiator,gladiator 2000,18w3165,365 Movies in 2023,"First off, I am never doing this again. I started off the year watching movies for enjoyment, but at some point it turned into a goal to watch 365, which I now regret. At many points I was simply watching comfort films that I had seen previously, as critical watching became way too laborious.

Anyways, here is the list and my rating of each movie. For ratings, I simply went with my enjoyment of the film overall and likeliness to rewatch, rather than quality of the film as a whole. For that I would rather rely on crowdsourced data anyways. I rated movies with the half-star system (i.e. 1-10 without decimals) so to avoid everything being 6-8, I was quite harsh. I don't necessarily think movies rated 2-3 below are bad.

gladiator,gladiator 2000,18rv5z8,Only 4 Movies have ever made me cry What about you?,"
What movies have made you actually cry or get emotional. Only 4 movies have ever made me fill up with tears. Those movies are Toy Story 3 (2010) Coco (2019) Castaway (2000) Up (2019)

Other movies had me thinking after they finished and left a lasting impact on me like The Green Mile,  The Shawshank Redemption, Gladiator, Lion, The elephant man,  Philadelphia.

I never cry in real life. I am a man who I would say is not an emotional person and very rarely cry or show emotion but there is something about these movies that had me emotional and thinking about them long after they'd finished.  I think because most of them deal with loss and letting go.

I've watched a lot of movies and most of them do nothing for me. just goes to show you how powerful these movies are.",0,55,1703662839.0,2023-12-27 07:40:39,False
gladiator,gladiator 2000,18ihoer,"Ebert gave Gladiator (2000) a middling review, mostly panning the art direction and 'shabby special effects.' What exactly was he talking about?","Personally, I remember Gladiator to be a visually striking film, and I certainly don't recall anything that's aged particularly poorly in the effects — so I admit, I find Ebert's 2-star review to be kinda baffling.

Can anyone explain the flaws or film theory behind what he's getting at in this take?

*A foolish choice in art direction casts a pall over Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" that no swordplay can cut through. The film looks muddy, fuzzy and indistinct. Its colors are mud tones at the drab end of the palette, and it seems to have been filmed on grim and overcast days. This darkness and a lack of detail in the long shots helps obscure shabby special effects (the Colosseum in Rome looks like a model from a computer game), and the characters bring no cheer: They're bitter, vengeful, depressed. By the end of this long film, I would have traded any given gladiatorial victory for just one shot of blue skies. (There are blue skies in the hero's dreams of long-ago happiness, but that proves the point.)*

gladiator,gladiator 2000,18262r3,how chicken run led to the creation of the best animated feature category at the academy awards.,"with the long awaited chicken run sequel slated for release next month, people are likely revisiting the original 2000 classic. chicken run was aardman's first feature film and boy, if they didn't make an impression. the film received overwhelmingly good reviews and went onto become the highest grossing stop motion movie of all time, a record that it still holds two decades later. years after it's original release, it's still beloved.

however, what you may not know is that it also led to the creation of the best animated feature category at the academy awards. 

chicken run was one of 2000's most well received movies. critics loved it and it made numerous lists of the best movies of the year. many people were hoping that all this acclaim would result in a best picture nomination. the nominees were announced and the best picture race would involve gladiator, crouching tiger hidden dragon, chocolat, traffic, and erin brockovich. but not only did chicken run not get a best picture nomination, it didn't get nominated for ANYTHING.

the movie going public was not pleased by this. and it really opened their eyes to the fact that animated movies are under represented at the academy awards. sure, plenty of animated movies had been nominated for academy awards in the past but there wasn't a category for animated movies. many found it so baffling that a ceremony that was intended to honor the best movies of the previous year didn't have any category for the best animated movies of the year. 

well, after the 2001 academy awards ended, the academy decided to seriously consider making such a category. after some discussions and voting, the best animated feature category was created.

and that's the way it has been ever since. since then, 22 films have won the academy award for best animated feature and it seems like that number is only going to grow as the years continue. if you think about it, chicken run not getting a nomination was kind of a good thing. it led to changes in the academy and helped to fight against the stigma that animated movies are merely children's entertainment.",15,14,1700759962.0,2023-11-23 17:19:22,False

Aurelius didn't want to continue with the roman empire and instead wished to return back to a republic, with the senate having the power.  

While I feel he was genuine with that sentiment, how he went about it was a total bitch move.  Why not abdicate his emperorship and give it back to the senate WHILE he was Caesar?  oh of course not.  he wants to enjoy his absolute power over Rome until his death.  Only THEN did he want rome to be a republic again which obviously wouldn't go over well with his 'should be' successor (commodus). 

I actually enjoyed it when I saw commodus kill his dad; he honestly deserved it.  Especially when he said the failures of a son, is the failure of the father (something to that effect).  What an asshole father.",4,8,1693199024.0,2023-08-28 06:03:44,False

gladiator,gladiator 2000,12kwykh,Why are these movies rated r if theyre not bad enough? Almost all new pg13s and pgs are worse than those.,"These are post-1980s Rs with the wrong rating.

The Last Of The Mohicans 1992-Theres just violence, and violence doesnt hurt ratings.  This could have been PG13 or perhaps PG, no way did it deserve the R.

Tombstone 1993-On very Avatar level, there is 1 f bomb and lots of gd-bombs which PG13s can be like.

Beyond Rangoon 1995-Just violence, this coulda been PG.

The Ghost And The Darkness 1996-Not as bad as a PG like Apollo 13, 1 or 2 s bombs and 1 gd.

Nicholas Cage's Snake Eyes 1998-On Transformers level, just 1 f word.

The Matrix 1999-Ok a lot of PG13s are like this, theres no f word but lots of s bombs and gd bombs just like Battle Los Angeles.

Gladiator 2000-Almost just violence, one use of shithole, that youre going to hear in PG13 anyway.

Underworld 2003-Violence, scariness and 2 or 3 fwords, a lot of PG13 horrors are like this.

Anthony Hopkins's The Wolf Man 2010-Just violence!  It coulda been PG!

Prometheus 2012-On Transformers 2 level, just 2 or 3 fwords.

Sinister 2012-No f words or nudity.

Abraham Lincoln The Vampire Hunter 2012-Just violence to be exact.

Hacksaw Ridge 2016-On Transformers 3 level.

Jackie 2016-Not bad enough to be R at all, just 2 fwords, assholes and gds.

Resident Evil Final Chapter 2016-On Skeleton Key level except theres no f word.

Do you think this is ridiculous?  Just think, there were a lot of Rs from the late 1960s to late 1980s/early 90s because PG13 didnt exist til 1990 when Days Of Thunder came out but Rs seemed to have increased in number some point after the early 2000s.  Even if PG13 existed in 1980 Airplane still should have been R in the first place with those bare breasts.  Also I dont see why its ok to watch a ""shoulda been R"" PG13 with bare breasts and f words like Titanic but its considered wrong and sinful to watch a ""wrongfully rated"" R movie like The Last Of The Mohicans, should it be the other way round?  It should be like this:

The Patriot-PG

Jackie-PG13

Titanic-R

gladiator,gladiator 2000,ynitzc,"You can save 5 movies that came out in the last 22 years (2000-2022), every other movie will be destroyed. What are they?","Imagine a scenario where somehow we lose every movie that came out since 2000. You can only save 5 of them since the year of 2000. There will be other movies that come out after 2022 and the ones that were made before 2000 are fine as well. Let’s assume if you save these movies, you can share them with other people. So one might do his whole family a favor and save all 3 of the Lord of the Rings movies so they don’t have to worry about losing those. 

Mine are 1. Inglorious Bastards (2009)- my favorite Tarantino movie besides Pulp Fiction. 2. Interstellar (2014)- like it more than Inception and the best Sci-Fi movie this century imo.  3. About Time (2013)- my guilty pleasure Romance pick that is so much more than just a Romance film. 
4. Shaun of The Dead (2004)- I did not want to think about a world where this gem didn’t exist so I just had to save it. 
5. Gladiator (2000) - couldn’t help myself. Gladiator will be the movie I put on when I want to get my testosterone flowing! 

What are you saving?

Edit: I have to say I am very satisfied, yet not surprised by how many of you have also saved About Time (2013). It goes to show how strong that movie’s message is.

Edit 2: one that got away from me that I would like to add as an honorable mention is The Fall (2008). A truly breathtaking film that is so beautiful and unlike any movie I’ve seen.",35,194,1667716554.0,2022-11-06 06:35:54,False

Any others come to mind that may not be obvious to people, or are super obvious but people still might not know? Example of that would be, if you like *Enemy of the State*, you should watch *The Conversation*.

gladiator,gladiator 2000,xy1uoy,"[Gladiator, 2000] Is the best film I have ever seen and I want to talk about it.","I am 28 years old. I have watched a lot of movies in my short life. I have watched Gladiator at least four times. But after rewatching Gladiator released in 2000 staring  Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Connie Nielsen; directed by Ridley Scott, I can say - without a shadow of a doubt in my soul, that this is the best movie I have ever seen. 

The film is so god damn tight with its plot.

The actors never lose, not for one moment, character. I love that I hate Joaquin Phoneix as Commodus. I love that neumedian who mends Maximus's wound with his god damn spit stuff. I love that they call Maximus a spaniard, too. They don't even know Maximus was chosen to rule; and when that big German takes a bite of his soup for Maximus and fakes being poisoned. It's like, yea, everybody is on Maximus side: they crusifed his poor wife and child. All he wanted to do was go home.  

From the beginning scene with Maximus rallying his troops to war against the barbaric Germans, to the end when Maximus kills Commodus. It is such a master craft of cinema. God damnit God Damnit. Frankly, I would love to see a better movie made, but I don't think that will happen.

Dialogs so memorable too and you really involve into movie's story. It's well done and I can't compare this movie to anything else, it has its own charm. What a great movie!

gladiator,gladiator 2000,xho3vd,What movies have you watched that really impressed on the big screen but did not grip you nearly as much on TV?,"I got a 4k Blu-ray player a few months ago and have slowly been making my way through a lot of movies I like, this time with the added benefit of 4k video quality with HDR and Dolby Atmos sound.

Quite a few of them like the Revenant, Mad Max Fury Road, Rogue One, Mission Impossible Fallout, The Dark Knight, Blade Runner 2049, Thor Ragnarok etc were engrossing watches and I was doing nothing else but focus on the movie while it was on. That was how it was when I first saw them in the theatre.

Others though did not have the same effect. One recent example was Gladiator. Here the battle scenes were spectacular but the impact of the visuals and the starpower of the performances did not hit me nearly as hard as from when I remember watching this in 2000. It's also possible the issues with the highly rewritten script which led to lots of improvised scenes and dialogue were also more apparent. 

I also had the same issue with 300 and pretty much any Michael Bay movie I have seen where if you are not watching it at the theatre, you may as well not bother.",0,12,1663525548.0,2022-09-18 19:25:48,False

gladiator,gladiator 2000,woedk3,[Personal] Movie Hall of Fame,"I recently went through an interesting exercise that reminds me of all the great movies out there and how much we love them. H/t to @ ChrisKlemmer for the idea. 

This is my personal Movie Hall of Fame. Rules for selection:

1. From the year you are born - now, each year there is a five-year window to select a movie for entry. For example, I was born in 1987, so the first year of eligibility would be movies released  between '83 - '87.
2. You choose one movie per year.
3. Every Presidential election year, you get the opportunity to put a ""Veteran's Committee"" selection in. This can be any movie outside the eligibility window that year, including movies from before you were born. For example in 1988, if I wanted to put The Wizard of Oz (1939) in that would be a chance to do so. \*Note you don't have to do so. Any movie in the 5-year window of that entry year is eligible as well.\*

This was more conflicting than I thought it would be, especially for more current years. There are also so many movies from our childhood we've seen a million times that aren't necessarily great movies, but they were a big impact on our lives, and so deciding if they get in based on that is difficult.

backtoblack,back to black,1k0lb5a,"Is Viola Davis Typecast? Love Her Work, But She Plays “Herself” In Every Role.","Let me start by saying—I’m a fan of Viola Davis. Her performances are always intense and powerful, and she brings so much depth to her roles. (Except for that Michelle Obama portrayal… yikes.)

That said, does anyone else feel like she’s often playing the same type of character? No matter the movie or show, she tends to portray a stern, emotionally guarded Black woman in a position of authority—someone battling internal conflict but masking it with a strong, no-nonsense exterior. It’s a pattern I’ve noticed over and over again, and even in her interviews, she seems very similar to the characters she plays.

Now, I’m not mad at it—she kills every role—but I’d love to see her step into something unexpected: comedy, sci-fi, even a laid-back romantic role. Something lighter or weird just to shake things up.

Anyone else feel this way? And who are some other actors you think have been typecast (for better or worse)?",0,27,1744812478.0,2025-04-16 15:07:58,False
backtoblack,back to black,1k0ay50,"Envy and Be Kind Rewind. Am I insane? Probably, a brief stream of consciousness*.","I go to local charity shops, usually picking up cheap films, often on DVD, sometimes on blu-ray, if a common film i'm vaguely interested in isn't streaming or if it is the rental price exceeds what it costs locally i'll go out and see if I can find it. 

  
This brings me onto the above two films. Firstly Envy, i saw it once on television, over 10 years ago, possibly 15 years ago. I learnt afterwards that it was filmed a while before it was released and held back from release as both Jack Black and Ben Stiller thought it was crap. I didn't hate it but ever since then i've not forgotten it. I keep an eye out for it used every so often but it's what Cathode Ray Dude calls a [Beige Whale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbkil4kutwI), it's something i'd buy if I see it but i'm not exactly scouring the internet for it. 

Be Kind Rewind is a bit different, it's still a Beige Whale but i've seen it around three times, again all on television, and so i've not really had a desire to see it again until recently when i realised I hadn't seen it in ages. Anyway i've caved in and bought both of them, for the total price of £3.64.   
  
Now i'm sure Envy is not a good film, but i have to se it again, I know it's insane to be even slightly obsessed with it but I have to see it again.

As for Be Kind Rewind, I love it, and I recall seeing it regularly in my local HMV but because i'd seen it on televison I wasn't interested at the time. I haven't really seen it since then, so when I went on ebay to buy them both I was expecting them to be quite expensive, Envy for being crap and Be kind Rewind by being the sort of film that people buy and keep forever like a good album rather than giving away or selling. I was genuinely surprised to get both for less than £4.   
  
 I will watch them, probably hate Envy and learn that i've grossly misremembered Be kind Rewind but for £1.32 i'm not going to complain. 

I just hope that any other films I end up feeling the need to own they will be just as cheap. So far nothing comes to mind though. 

Are there any films you don't own but have stuck with you for whatever reason?

backtoblack,back to black,1k087el,The Zone People,"Dialogue is for a scene from a sci-fi ethnographic film of life in the US-Mexico borderlands after a nuclear explosion. It’s a mix of an ethnographer’s voice-over dialogue and a variety of characters, in this case two immigrants from el Salvador:  

The best place to view the world of the 21st century is from the ruins of its alternative future. I walked around the ruins of the Zone to see if the walls would talk to me. Instead I met two twenty-year olds from El Salvador, camped out in the ruins of the old dairy.
They were eager to talk with me.
Like hobo heroes out of a Jack London or a John Steinbeck novel, they had tramped up and down the border before landing in McAllen, but they were following a frontier of death rather than silver strikes and class struggle. They talked to me about how they appreciated the relative scarcity of La Migra in the area. We talked about the weather for a while, then I asked them what they thought about the Zone, a city seemingly without boundaries, which created a junkyard of dreams, and which could potentially become infinite.

They told me about how and why they had ended up in the border years before the nuclear explosion: 

Immigrant 1:

""The images I watched every night in San Salvador, in endless dubbed reruns of American television, they made it seem like a place where everyone was young and rich and drove new cars and saw themselves on the TV. After ten thousand daydreams about those shows, I hitchhiked two thousand five hundred miles to McAllen. A year later I was standing in downtown McAllen, along with all the rest of the immigrants. I learned that nobody like us was rich or drove new cars — except the drug dealers — and the police were just as mean as back home. Nobody like us was on television either; we were invisible.”

Immigrant 2:

""The moment I remember about the crossing was when we were beyond the point of return, buried alive in the middle of a desert, in a hostile landscape. We just kept walking and walking, looking for water and hallucinating city lights.""

Immigrant 1:

""The first night we had to sleep next to a lagoon. I remember what I dreamt: I was drowning in a pool of red black mud. It was covering my body, I was struggling to break free. Then something pulled me down into the deep and I felt the mud. I woke up sweating and could barely breathe.""

Ethnographer's voice-over:

The rest of their story is a typical one for border crossings at the time:
As they walked through the dessert, their ankles were bleeding; their lips were cracked open and black; blisters covered their face. Like Depression-era hobos, their toes stood out from their shoes. The sun cynically laughs from high over their heads while it slow-roasts their brain. They told me they tried to imagine what saliva tasted like, they also would constantly try to remember how many days they had been walking.
When the Border Patrol found them on the side of the road, they were weeping and mumbling. An EMT gave them an IV drip before being driven to a detention center in McAllen. Two days later they were deported to Reynosa in the middle of the night, five days before the explosion.

The phenomenology of border crossings as experienced by these two Salvadorans was a prefiguration of life in the Zone: the traveling immigrants of yesteryear were already flaneurs traversing the ruins and new ecologies of evil. They were the first cartographers of the Zone.

The Zone is terra nullius. It is the space of nothingness, where the debris of modernity created the possibility for new things to emerge, it is also an abyss of mass graves staring back at bourgeois civilization, and a spontaneous laboratory where negations of what-is and transmutations are taking place, some pointing toward forms of imminent transcendence, while others seem to open entry-ways into black holes and new forms of night. The Zone is full of hyperstitions colliding with the silent and invisible act of forging yet-unknown landscapes. 

The modern conditions of life have ceased to exist here: 

Travel, trade, consumption, industry, technology, taxation, work, warfare, finance, insurance, government, cops, bureaucracy, science, philosophy — and all those things that together made possible the world of exploitation — have banished. 

Poetry, along with a disposition towards leisure, is one of the things that has survived. Isai calls it a “magical gift of our savagery.” ",0,2,1744765517.0,2025-04-16 02:05:17,False
backtoblack,back to black,1jzb9wd,"April 11-13 Box Office Recap: On its second weekend, 'A Minecraft Movie' became the second biggest video game movie worldwide with $552 million. 'The King of Kings' over-performs projections, 'Warfare' opens decently, while 'The Amateur' and 'Drop' underwhelm.","https://preview.redd.it/5wk8mzvkhvue1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ba860803c8b374c941afb76643bcd1250c8556d

Despite four wide releases this weekend, none of them could fight ***A Minecraft Movie*** for the top spot. ***The King of Kings*** delivered Angel Studios' second biggest debut, while stuff like ***The Amateur*** and ***Drop*** failed to light things up, although ***Warfare*** had a solid start.

The Top 10 earned a combined $145.1 million this weekend. That's up a colossal 112.4% from last year, when ***Civil War*** debuted with A24's biggest opener.

***A Minecraft Movie*** was still at #1, adding $78.5 million. That's a 52% drop; not as bad as some other video game films, but it's also quite rough for a family flick. For contrast, ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** dropped 36.9% on its second weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned $278.8 million, and it's still on track to finish with over $450 million domestically.

In second place, Angel Studios' ***The King of Kings*** earned $19.2 million in 3,200 theaters. That's the studio's second biggest debut, behind ***Sound of Freedom*** ($19.6 million). It's also the biggest debut for an animated bible film, surpassing ***The Prince of Egypt*** ($14.5 million), although ***Prince*** sold more tickets adjusted for inflation.

This is promising, and Angel Studios did a fantastic job with marketing. Not to mention having the film open with Easter around the corner, which should help it leg out. Like their prior films, they used the ""Pay It Forward"" feature, wherein someone can pay for a ticket for anyone else. The numbers reported are only those that were redeemed this weekend.

According to Angel Studios, 59% of the audience was female. Despite middling critic reviews, the audience loved it more: they gave it a rare ""A+"" on CinemaScore, indicating strong word of mouth. The film should leg out all the way to $60 million at the very least, especially with no animated competition till June.

In third place, 20th Century Studios' ***The Amateur*** debuted with $14.8 million this weekend. This debut is lower than the recent action film ***A Working Man*** ($15.5 million), although that had a more bankable name in the lead role.

While it's tough to get better numbers, one still thinks that the film could've opened higher than this. After all, Disney and 20th Century mounted an extensive campaign for the film, hoping to replicate other action film successes. But the thing with ***The Amateur*** is that it simply didn't offer anything new in the genre: a man loses his wife and sets out to get revenge. That's a genre that has been copied so many times, and it's tough to get excited for the 37th time it's played out. Even reviews (62% on RT) aren't really glowing.

According to 20th Century Studios, 57% of the audience was male, and 47% was 25 and over. They gave it a so-so ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which doesn't exactly inspire confidence. With options like ***Sinners*** and ***The Accountant 2*** coming up, it'd be a surprise if ***The Amateur*** got close to $40 million lifetime.

In fourth place, A24's ***Warfare*** debuted with $8.3 million in 2,670 theaters. That's A24's sixth biggest debut, and while far off from Alex Garland's ***Civil War*** ($25.5 million), it wasn't ever going to come close to those numbers.

All in all, it's a solid start for the film. War films have been finding success in theaters, although films revolving around Iraq War have been quite inconsistent; some have succeeded (***American Sniper*** and ***The Hurt Locker***), others not so much (***Green Zone*** and ***Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk***). A24 did a great job in emphasizing the film's plot points: a real-time story of soldiers in Iraq. Some fantastic reviews (94% on RT) certainly helped as well.

According to A24, 72% of the audience was male, and 53% was 25 and over. They gave it a great ""A–"" on CinemaScore, which is A24's best grade (their only other film to get this grade was ***The Iron Claw***). This is very encouraging, and suggests the film could leg out. For now, a $25 million domestic total is likely for ***Warfare***.

In fifth place, Universal/Blumhouse's ***Drop*** earned just $7.3 million in 3,085 theaters. That's below other Blumhouse titles like ***The Woman in the Yard*** ($9.3 million) and ***Wolf Man*** ($10 million). These numbers are also below director Christopher Landon's ***Happy Death Day 2U*** ($9.8 million), which was considered a disappointment back in 2019.

Even though the film cost just $11 million, it feels like Universal simply didn't know what to do with the film. Even though they premiered it at SXSW, where it earned great reviews (83% on RT), it feels like they didn't push it hard enough. Or maybe the concept: a woman asked to kill her date to save her family didn't entice audiences. It's not unreasonable to believe that had the film come out during Blumhouse's golden years, it could've opened with $20 million or more. Are audiences giving up on Blumhouse? 

According to Universal, 53% of the audience was female and 35% was in the 25-34 demographic. They gave it a middling ""B"" on CinemaScore; this is not bad, but it's not great either. With some competition on the way, it's unlikely it save some face. It'd be a surprise if the film came anywhere close to $25 million lifetime.

***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 3*** earned $6 million this weekend. That's a 14% drop from ***Part 2*** ($6.9 million) last week. Across these 3 films, they have amassed $36.3 million domestically.

***A Working Man*** was hit hard by the newcomers. It dropped a steep 59%, adding $3 million this weekend. The film has earned $33.4 million so far, and it looks like it will struggle to hit $40 million domestically.

Disney's ***Snow White*** continues its freefall. The film now dropped 51%, adding just $2.8 million this weekend. Clearly, this film simply has no legs. The film has earned just $82 million so far, and it's guaranteed to finish below $90 million domestically. Terrible all around.

Ninth place belonged to Blumhouse's ***The Woman in the Yard***, which fell 54% and added $2 million this weekend. The film has earned $20.3 million so far, and it's finishing with something close to $25 million.

Rounding up the Top 10 was ***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 2***. The film collapsed 86% this weekend, earning $961,861 this weekend. Through 10 days, it has earned $10.9 million so far.

#**OVERSEAS**

***A Minecraft Movie*** was still the #1 movie overseas. It added $79.6 million, taking its worldwide total to a colossal $552 million after just 2 weekends. The best markets are the UK ($39.8M), China ($20.3M), Germany ($18.9M), Mexico ($18.7M) and Australia ($18.5M). With this, it has already passed the ***Sonic*** movies to become the second biggest video game movie ever. The billion milestone is becoming more and more likely.

***The Amateur*** slightly over-performed projections overseas, earning $17.2 million for a $32.2 million worldwide debut. The best debuts were in France ($1.6M), the UK ($1.4M), Mexico ($1.4M), Germany ($1.1M) and Japan ($1.1M). Based on the pattern of other action films, the film should hit the $100 million milestone, although some rough competition will put a challenge to that.

***Snow White*** is nearing the end of its run worldwide. The film added just $4.7 million overseas, for a terrible $182.3 million worldwide total. Based on its drops, it looks like the film might go under $200 million worldwide. On a $270 million budget. Ouch.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Moana 2* | Nov/27 | Disney | $139,787,385 | $460,405,297 | $1,059,197,729 | $150M
*Novocaine* | Mar/14 | Paramount | $8,809,436 | $19,861,854 | $33,545,800 | $18M

- ***Moana 2*** has closed with $1.059 billion worldwide. Considering it was heading straight to streaming, that's a huge win for Disney Animation. Even if the quality of the film suffered as a result. The film debuted with a gigantic $389 million worldwide, which was the biggest debut for an animated title. But the film proved to be a bit front-loaded, especially for an animated film. A third film is inevitable, but Disney should really begin development as a film, not a half-assed TV show changed to a film.

- No pain, no gain. Paramount's ***Novocaine*** closed with just $33 million worldwide, failing to recoup its $18 million budget. That's eerily close the numbers earned by Jack Quaid's previous film, ***Companion***. Despite hitting #1 on its opening weekend, the film simply couldn't find an audience in the weeks afterwards. Quaid may be popular online, but that doesn't mean people are paying to watch him lead a movie.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

One film will try to challenge ***Minecraft*** for the top spot.

That film is Ryan Coogler's ***Sinners***, which stars Michael B. Jordan in a dual role in this horror title. Warner Bros. has backed up the film with an extensive marketing campaign, granting Coogler with his terms: the film's rights will revert back to him in 25 years. Coogler has had massive success with the ***Creed*** and ***Black Panther*** films, but this is his first major original film. And early reviews suggest he really cooked: it's sitting at a fantastic 100% on RT with 45 reviews so far. The big question is: will audiences support this?

[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/sinners-review-michael-b-jordan-ryan-coogler-1236363344/) (70):

>It's vibrant and richly acted, and also a wild throat-ripping blowout. But though overloaded at times, it's the rare mainstream horror film that's about something weighty and soulful: the wages of sin in Black America.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/04/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-x-2-reteam-vampire-movie-1236365142/):

>*Sinners* marks another strong reason why Ryan Coogler is at the top of his generation of filmmakers, and Jordan continues to show why he is a real deal movie star.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/sinners-review-michael-b-jordan-ryan-coogler-horror-1236186742/) (90):

>The movie is smart horror, even poetic at times, with much to say about race and spiritual freedom. It’s not in the Jordan Peele league in terms of welding social commentary to bone-chilling fear. But *Sinners* is a unique experience, unlike anything either the director or Jordan has done before.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1831292/sinners-ryan-coogler-movie-review/) (9/10):

>""Sinners"" is several things at once — a monster movie, a blood-soaked action film, a sexy and sensual thriller, and a one-location horror flick as intense and paranoia-driven as anything from the original ""Assault on Precinct 13"" or Quentin Tarantino's filmography – but its greatest strength comes from how well Coogler blends every big idea on his mind.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-vampire-horror/) (88):

>“Sinners” is a bloody, brilliant motion picture. Ryan Coogler finds within the vampire genre an ethereal thematic throughline; and within the music genre a disturbing, tempting monster. Stunningly photographed, engrossing cinema — epic to the point where it seemingly never ends, which is undeniably indulgent, but no great sin. This is a film about indulgence, the power indulgence wields and the dangers indulgence invites into our lives. It’s a sweaty, intoxicating, all-nighter of a movie, and its allure cannot be denied.

[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/sinners-movie-2025-michael-b-jordan-cast-ryan-coogler-b2730833.html) (4/5):

>If cinema weren’t in such a sickly state, *Sinners*’s electric fusion of genres – historical epic, horror, and squelchy actioner – would be a guaranteed box office sensation. Instead, the film arrives with an uneasy sense that this is some kind of final stand for original ideas. One can only hope audiences recognise its bounty of riches.

[The Guardian](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sinners/) (3/5):

>For many, the movie could as well do without the supernatural element, and I admit I’m one of them; I’d prefer to see a real story with real jeopardy work itself out. But there is energy and comic-book brashness

Vanity Fair (80):

> Sinners is propulsive and stirring entertainment, messy but always compelling. The film’s fascinating array of genres and tropes and ideas swirls together in a way that is, I suppose, singularly American.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-vampire-movie-1235114698/) (83):

>Sinners is nothing if not a film about genre, and the distinctly American imperative of cross-pollinating between them to create something that feels new and old — high and low — at the same time.

backtoblack,back to black,1jvejcc,I think I just found a new Unofficial Trilogy,"A while back I was on a spy/60's kick, and stumbled on watching these 3 movies in a row, and was quite suprised at how well they fit together. It was The Good Shepherd, Thirteen Days, and then JFK. There's a little disconnect with some of the actors obviously, but other than that I really recommend watching these in order!

A Good Shepherd isn't a great movie on its own, but it really sets the table for the next too nicely with detailing the creation of the CIA and the type of power the intelligence community obtained. It also ends right before the events of Thirteen Days. 

That movie then picks up and shows the direct conflict between the intelligence community and now brings the Joint Chiefs directly into the mix, and its ending sets the table for the last movie.

And that movie's opening sequence basically sums up the events of the previous two movies and then continues on. I also like how Mr. X's monologue about their Black Ops activities is a bit of a callback to events in the Good Shepherd as well.

Not sure what to call this trilogy, the Deep State trilogy (lol) or the Lone Gunmen Trilogy, but I was impressed with how these three fit together with the narrative and tones even though they were disconnected, other than the historical events. Highly recommend!

I also watched a few other movies that could technically fit into this, but I liked keeping to these 3 since I felt it was very coherent as a whole.

I love that kind of absurdism in film, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes and beyond, so I wanted to bring a few lesser known films to the table for those who might enjoy them, but also I'd love some recommendations for more films that are in the same absurdist vein.

OK, so here is my shortlist:

**Poolboy 2: Drowning out the Fury:** A movie about a banned movie where Kevin Sorbo plays a racist Vietnam veteran who sets out to take back the LA pool cleaning industry from Mexican immigrants. Danny Trejo plays the boss. From the same fictional writer/director that brought us Helen Keller vs Nightwolves.

**Butt Boy:** Few people can see past the title to even give this microbudget masterpiece a chance, and telling someone the premise only makes it worse. The blackest of black comedies, played 100% straight. For something so low budget, it punches way above it's weight - the script, cinematography and so on are all really on point.

**Rubber:** The story of a telekinetic killer car tyre, for no reason.

**Detention**: I feel like this one deserves an honourable mention, starts out as just yet another teen slasher movie, delves into the movie within a movie within a movie trope but doesn't linger there - in fact it doesn't linger anywhere for long, it's an ADHD film on Ritalin that plays homage to anything and everything. The reviews are polarised, very much a love it or hate it film, people accuse it of trying too hard to be cool, but personally I think that is intentional, and part of the joke.",1,38,1743737698.0,2025-04-04 04:34:58,False

backtoblack,back to black,1jq4agm,Hollywood Ignores Southern History Outside of Slavery and Civil Rights,"Alright, I gotta go off about something that’s been bugging me for years. Why does Hollywood act like the South didn’t exist outside of three time periods: Slavery, the Civil War, and the Civil Rights Movement? I swear, every time Hollywood makes a historical movie set in the South, it’s either about plantations, the Confederacy, or racism in the 1950s and 60s. And yeah, those are important topics, but come on there’s *so much more* to Southern history than that! We got endless movies about New York during the American Revolution, but what about the battles fought in the South? The Siege of Charleston? The Battle of Kings Mountain? Francis Marion, the freakin’ ""Swamp Fox,"" running guerrilla warfare against the British? 

What about Reconstruction? One of the most chaotic, interesting, and defining periods in American history. But no one wants to make a serious, big-budget movie about the struggles of freed Black Americans, the rise of Black politicians, or the violent backlash from groups like the KKK.  

The Gilded Age? Yeah, the South had one too! People forget that Southern cities were rapidly industrializing during this time. Atlanta, Birmingham, and New Orleans were booming. There were Southern tycoons, political corruption, and insane social shifts happening. And if Hollywood *did* finally get off their butts and make a movie about the Gilded Age South, it could be one of the most interesting and layered historical films in *years*. They could actually show how Jim Crow laws didn’t just appear out of nowhere in the 1950s, but were being put into place *right after* Reconstruction ended. This was the era when Black Americans were building schools, businesses, and entire communities only to face a wave of voter suppression, segregation laws, and violent crackdowns from white supremacists who were trying to erase Black progress.

And you *know* what would make it even better? Showing the *early* Civil Rights movements that were happening *long before* the 1950s. People act like activism just popped up with Martin Luther King Jr., but Black leaders in the South were already fighting against Jim Crow in the 1880s and 1890s. Figures like Ida B. Wells were out here exposing lynching in the press. Black lawyers were challenging segregation in courts. Organizations like the Colored Farmers’ Alliance were forming to fight economic oppression. Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Du Bois were having *intellectual debates* about the best way forward for Black America.

Imagine a movie that *actually* covers this period a Southern drama set in the 1890s, showing Black politicians who were elected *during* Reconstruction but getting pushed out by racist laws and violence. Show a young journalist exposing lynching. Show teachers and activists opening Black schools despite threats from white supremacists. Show everyday Black Southerners *fighting back* against Jim Crow as it was first taking shape. And on the flip side, explore the political corruption, industrialization, and economic struggles in the South at the time. It would be *so much richer* than the usual “South = slavery, Civil War, or MLK” narratives we always get. 

And of course the World Wars. You’d think the South sat those out, the way Hollywood ignores it. The South had military bases everywhere. Tons of Southerners fought overseas. The economy transformed. Black and white Southerners moved to industrial cities for work. Hell, New Orleans was the birthplace of Andrew Higgins' landing crafts, which Eisenhower literally said won World War II. 

It’s like Hollywood only acknowledges the South when they can use it for trauma and oppression narratives. And don’t get me wrong those stories *should* be told. But there's so much more to explore, from colonial conflicts to economic transformations to Southern involvement in global events. But I guess that doesn’t fit the only two stereotypes Hollywood has for the South: “Confederate rednecks” or “civil rights heroes.”",0,26,1743639565.0,2025-04-03 01:19:25,False

To get back home, they'll have to master the terrain while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected crafter named Steve.*

**Metacritic:** [48/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-minecraft-movie/)

Some Reviews:

[The National - William Mullaly](https://www.thenationalnews.com/arts-culture/2025/04/02/a-minecraft-movie-review/) \- 3/5

>While many bad films are made with love, sequels, spinoffs and big-budget adaptations often make the artform feel inert because they are produced with so little heart that they might as well have been generated by AI. But here's the thing: I actually liked *A Minecraft Movie*. I'm as surprised as you are. This is not a disaster. Not by a mile. In fact, for most of its duration, it's downright charming and, in parts, had me laughing out loud.

[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review-jason-momoa-jack-black-1236352502/)

>Watching “A Minecraft Movie,” we’re always aware that the story is something that’s been grafted onto the world, and that we don’t have much of a dramatic stake in it — that it’s just the film’s way of cobbling together something that “works.” (Which, in its way, is very Minecraft.) Some of this is amusing, but like the rest of “A Minecraft Movie” it never feels like it matters. Yet it’s no insult to say that, in this case, that’s actually true to the spirit of a video game that turns life into a blockhead version of itself.

[The Hollywood Reporter - Lovia Gyrakye](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review-jason-momoa-jack-black-1236179043/)

>The most disappointing aspect of *A Minecraft Movie*, directed by the husband-wife duo who go by Jared Hess (*Napoleon Dynamite*, *Nacho Libre*), isn’t that it’s born out of an existing IP. We live in a world of low-effort reboots, unnecessary remakes and movies operating as extensions of corporate brands. Another one of these gluttonous projects is hardly surprising. What makes *A Minecraft Movie* so dispiriting is how it fails to spark the imagination, betraying a core tenet of the game on which it’s based. 

[The Wrap - Michael Ordona](https://www.thewrap.com/minecraft-movie-review-jason-momoa-jack-black/)

>The most accurate summation of “A Minecraft Movie” is probably “It is what it is.” It’s what it’s supposed to be. It probably won’t dig up many new converts to the game, but should strike box-office silver, at least. (And fans, be sure to stick around for two credits scenes – especially the second one.)

[IndieWire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/a-minecraft-movie-review-1235112484/) \- C

>It’s a real credit to Black’s irrepressibly unique comic energy that “A Minecraft Movie” never feels quite as hypocritical as it should. Either disastrously ill-suited for its message about how money is the enemy of joy, or immaculately *well*\-suited for its message about much harder it is to build things than it is to destroy them, Hess’ film can’t help but feel like its very existence is an affront to the creative freedom that has allowed “Minecraft” to become such a vital form of self-exploration for kids around the world (even Warner Bros.’ choice to call it “A Minecraft Movie\*”\* as opposed to “The Minecraft Movie” implies a spectrum of different concepts, despite the reality of a business that can only imagine this one). But Black — whatever his charms, and regardless of how well they’re deployed here — is a living testament to the idea that people can still thrive by staying true to their own expression. If not in this world, then perhaps in one of their own design. 

[IGN - Jesse Hassenger](https://www.ign.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-review-jack-black-jason-momoa?utm_source=instagram,threads,twitter) \- 6/10

>For a big-studio adaptation of a massively popular video-game, A Minecraft Movie lets a surprising amount of its director’s personality shine through. Napoleon Dynamite’s Jared Hess manages to fit some laugh-out-loud silliness into his Overworld saga before surrendering to the obligations of CG-driven fantasy adventure. Thematically, A Minecraft Movie offers a pat world-is-what-you-make-it lesson, but Jack Black and Jason Momoa in particular sell it with a lot of comic enthusiasm.

[AV Club - Jacob Oller](https://www.avclub.com/a-minecraft-movie-review)

>One could rightfully question pretty much all of *A Minecraft Movie*, a formulaic template ornamented with surrealism. Some moments bear the scribbled signature of a filmmaker with offbeat passions. These are quickly plastered over by the hotel artwork of a four-quadrant IP extravaganza—and even the by-the-numbers sequences seem jumbled, out of order, or repeated. Yet, there’s something fitting about this film’s contradictions. *Minecraft* is fertile ground for innovation and exploitation. It’s adaptable, limited mostly by those playing it. One can build something personal, copy something mass produced, or attempt to tweak one with the other. Those behind *A Minecraft Movie* saw infinite possibilities laid out before them and—unlike another adaptation of a popular building pastime, *The Lego Movie*—opted for the one that’s been made a thousand times before.

[New York Post - Johnny Oleksinski](https://nypost.com/2025/04/02/entertainment/a-minecraft-movie-review-idiotic-video-game-film-stomps-on-your-brain/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=nypost) \- 1/4

>Your noggin will certainly be done in by Steve and Garrett (Momoa) flying through the air in a risque position suggesting a sex act. Really, “A Minecraft Movie” a 101-minute lobotomy. Put that on the poster. For the uninitiated, the Overworld — I’m pretty sure — is a pixelated place where a player can erect buildings, create tools and design weapons out of blocks. The rules are unclear, as the filmmakers picked silliness over storytelling. Stacking cubes would not, at first glance, seem like a strong plot to hang an action-adventure film on, however “The Lego Movie” did so with cleverness, heart and humor. Trust me: “The Lego Movie” is “Lawrence of Arabia” next to “Minecraft.”

[Next Best Picture](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/3046) \- [Giovanni Lago](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/giovanni-lago) \- 3/10

>There’s a world where “A Minecraft Movie” actually backs the idealism of creativity, which it so proudly boasts in its barebones story. Maybe if the film were animated, it could’ve played far better to the concept of endless possibilities and allowed for a far more visually dazzling spectacle. Inherently, maybe it would never even be possible, as the idea of creativity can only be celebrated as little as possible when it’s given the parameters of being in such a lazy ip scrape of the barrel as this. There used to be a time when a majority of children’s films were made with such care and intention. Now it seems all you need is buzzwords, celebrities, and “Avengers: Endgame” clap-inducing moments, all of which “A Minecraft Movie” has, unlike a soul, which at least the game feels like it possesses.

[The Daily Beast](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2345) \- [Nick Schager](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/nick-schager)

>So sloppy is *A Minecraft Movie* that it can’t keep track of its various concerns, highlighted by a mirthless subplot—in which Jennifer Coolidge’s vice principal picks up and woos an Overworld resident who’s traveled to our universe—that it basically drops around the midway point. Buried deep within Hess’ wannabe blockbuster is a message about how creativity is cool and, thus, so too are outcasts. Yet nothing about this hodgepodge fits together. *Minecraft* enthusiasts will be pleased by the film’s various nods to its multiplatform predecessor. Nonetheless, shouting out isn’t the same thing as faithfully celebrating and translating, and those with no experience assembling towers, villages, and weapons in Mojang Studios’ sandbox will undoubtedly find it all scattershot and wearisome. It’s proof that you can build it, but that doesn’t mean anyone—much less newbies—will come.",1320,1195,1743620357.0,2025-04-02 19:59:17,False
backtoblack,back to black,1joeht9,"March 28-30 Box Office Recap: Jason Statham's 'A Working Man' over-performs and tops the box office, while 'Snow White' collapses a horrible 66% on its second weekend. 'The Chosen' and 'The Woman in the Yard' had decent debuts, but 'Death of a Unicorn' flopped with just $5.7 million.","https://preview.redd.it/1vs90px2d3se1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2ebc5ef1c093da9fe4611c8661655c971899f16

A $270 million movie couldn't win against Jason Statham.

***A Working Man*** over-performed projections and managed to steal the #1 spot, marking another win for Jason Statham. That was at the cost of ***Snow White***'s second weekend, which had a horrible drop amidst negative buzz and word of mouth. The rest of the newcomers was a mixed bag; ***The Chosen*** had a fantastic debut, ***The Woman in the Yard*** did okay, while ***Death of a Unicorn*** flopped.

The Top 10 earned a combined $68.4 million this weekend. That's off a poor 47.3% from last year, when ***Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire*** opened with $80 million.

Debuting #1, Amazon MGM's ***A Working Man*** earned $15.5 million in 3,262 theaters. This debut is almost on par with Statham and Ayer's previous film, ***The Beekeeper*** ($16.5 million).

All in all, this is a great start, and it's a sign that Statham can still attract audiences to theaters after more than 20 years in the business. The premise and the trailers were basically what you come to expect from Statham: an ""ordinary man"" with a job, who is actually a badass guy who kills bad guys. That's not different from other Statham titles but remember: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Which might be why Statham is still having a lucrative career, and is also one of the very few actors who only make theatrical films and zero TV shows. No amount of mixed reviews (52% on RT) will change the audience's mind here; with Statham, you know what you're getting.

According to Amazon MGM, 60% of the audience was male and 37% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. It was a ""dad movie""; 42% of the audience was 45 and over. They gave it a middling ""B"" on CinemaScore, below ***Beekeeper*** (B+). It's unlikely it can hold as well as ***Beekeeper*** due to the amount fo competition, but it should still finish with over $45 million domestically. Statham already has another film, ***Mutiny***, ready for January 2026 and it should also perform well.

Oh, ***Snow White***.

You know, we're not gonna act like there was hope here. The opening weekend fell way below expectations and the film posted some mediocre weekdays, indicating that the film would not have legs. Yet we weren't prepared for the second weekend drop.

***Snow White*** earned $14.3 million this weekend. That's a brutal 66% drop, which is worse than any of the Disney live-action remakes. It's similar to the second weekend drop of ***Dumbo*** (60.4%), but that film had ***Shazam!*** ($53.5 million) and ***Pet Sematary*** ($24.5 million) as competition, while ***Snow White*** has almost nothing. This drop is a testament of negative buzz and word of mouth that has plagued the film.

Through 10 days, ***Snow White*** has earned a terrible $66.9 million so far. With ***Minecraft*** coming to take away its PLF screens, it will continue falling. One thing is clear from this: the film is gonna miss $100 million domestically, which is simply unbelievable. 

In third place, ***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 1*** surpassed expectations. Playing in 2,478 theaters, the film earned a pretty great $11.7 million this weekend. By far the best debut in the ***Chosen*** franchise. The second and third parts will be released on April 4 and April 11, respectively.

Universal/Blumhouse's ***The Woman in the Yard*** debuted with $9.3 million in 2,842 theaters. That debut is not far off from Blumhouse's ***Wolf Man***, which disappointed with just $10.8 million back in January.

Considering the very low buzz and anemic pre-sales, this is a very solid numbers. And it's a testament to Blumhouse's strength that they can get a nothing film like this to debut to almost $10 million. Especially considering the weak reviews (43% on RT). Perhaps with very few horror choices, ***The Woman in the Yard*** managed to attract an audience that really wanted to go to the movies.

According to Universal, 55% of the audience was female, with its biggest demo women over 25 (31%). While it surpassed expectations, don't expect this to have a long life in theaters. It got a terrible ""C–"" on CinemaScore, which is the exact same grade as ***Wolf Man***. With competition on the way, it's unlikely ***The Woman in the Yard*** can make more than $25 million domestically.

In fifth place, A24's ***Death of a Unicorn*** flopped with just $5.7 million in 3,050 theaters. That's one of the worst debuts for a film playing in over 3,000 theaters, and it's another A24 misfire after the performance of ***Opus*** two weeks ago.

Comedy horrors can be a tough sell; A24's ***Y2K*** was another one of those which flopped back in December. Even with big names like Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega attached, they have not found much success outside franchises. And despite the A24 name usually signaling quality, the reviews for the film were very middling following its SXSW debut (55% on RT).

According to A24, 51% of the audience was male and its biggest demo was women over 25 (29%). They gave it a poor ""B–"", which is quite bad for a comedy. With so many options on the way, ***Death of a Unicorn*** will probably finish below $15 million domestically. That'd be disappointing.

GKids re-released ***Princess Mononoke*** in 330 IMAX theaters this weekend, where it earned a pretty great $3.8 million. That took its lifetime total to $14.7 million.

***Captain America: Brave New World*** eased 27%, adding $2.9 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $196.6 million.

***Black Bag*** went from second place to eighth place, dropping 48% and adding $2.1 million this weekend. The film has earned $18.7 million, and it's gonna finish with around $22 million domestically.

***Mickey 17*** is nearing the end of its run. It dropped 47%, grossing $1.9 million. The film's domestic total stands at $43.6 million, and it's going to finish with around $47 million.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Paramount's ***Novocaine***, which continues its collapse. This time, it had a steep 60%, earning just $1.4 million this weekend. The film has amassed just $18.8 million, and it will make just $21 million at most. Practically the same amount as ***Companion***.

***The Alto Knights*** didn't save face on its second weekend. It collapsed 65%, earning just $1.1 million this weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned an anemic $5.5 million, and it's gonna gonna close with less than $7 million domestically. Pathetic.

The documentary ***The Encampments*** (which follows the 2024 Palestine solidarity campus encampments at Columbia University and other pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses during the Gaza war) broke records despite playing in just one theater (the Angelika Film Center in New York). It earned $76,419 this weekend, which is the biggest per-theater average for a documentary. It will continue expanding in a few weeks.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Snow White*** was still the biggest Hollywood entry, but it added just $22.1 million overseas. And that took its worldwide total to just $142.7 million after two weeks. The best markets are the UK ($8.7M), Mexico ($6.9M), Italy ($6.6M), France ($5.5M) and Brazil ($4.5M). Very brutal all around. With the way it's dropping, the film won't much further than $200 million worldwide. Hell, if ***Minecraft*** surprises, it could go sub $200 million. At a $270 million budget, that's a flop for the ages.

***A Working Man*** debuted with $16.6 million overseas, for a pretty good $32.1 million worldwide debut. The best debuts were in China ($2.9M), Germany ($1.4M), Australia ($1.1M), Mexico ($1.1M), and the UK ($867K). With so many markets still left, this should get to $100 million worldwide easily.

***Mickey 17*** added $5.2 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $120.9 million.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Sonic the Hedgehog 3* | Dec/20 | Paramount | $60,102,146 | $236,115,100 | $491,115,100 | $122M

- ***Sonic the Hedehog 3*** has closed with a fantastic $491 million worldwide. While it was later surpassed by ***Mufasa*** in daillies, the film is not a loser in the slightest. It's hard to be disappointed at a franchise where each film makes more than the one prior. Paramount already found their next big franchise, to the point that they already scheduled a fourth film for March 2027. That one should definitely hit $500 million.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

After years stuck in development hell, ***A Minecraft Movie*** is finally hitting theaters. The film stars Jason Momoa, Jack Black, Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, and Sebastian Hansen, and follows four misfits who are pulled through a portal into a cubic world that thrives on imagination, having no choice but to master the world while embarking on a quest with an expert crafter named Steve. The trailers have been... quite terrible, to say the least. But despite that, the popularity of ***Minecraft*** is just too big that families will probably still watch it. Let's just hope the final film is less painful than its trailers.

I remember looking in my dad's ""Magic Bag Of Old Movies"" finding it along side Machete while looking for the Bremen Town Musicians. I think their was a person on the cover with dark eyes. From what I can remember, the movie was about a child who sees dead people, and something happens to him and his mother see ghosts which lead her to uncover the horrific past of a location which reveals that they were human trafficking or doing unlawful human labor. Some of the things that is remember well is that some of the character or ghosts have their arms cover in black delve which they use to dye fabric. As well as a scene where the hoy and his mother are at a little shop beside the side walk, and there's a little shrine that had oranges. And when the little boy turns towards the shrine he sees a man bent down the shrine eating one of the oranges (didn't bother peeling it >:c) and when the man turns to look at the kid one of his cheeks were ripped off and bloody.

backtoblack,back to black,1jlt9tx,"U Turn (1997), AKA The Worst Thing Oliver Stone’s Ever Done","_U Turn_ has one of the weirder shelf lives of Oliver Stone’s movies. Originating as the 1994 John Ridley screenplay _Stray Dogs_, it was picked up by Oliver Stone & collaborator Richard Rutkowski, where it was substantially reworked – however, because their edits were less than 40% of the script, WGA rules meant Ridley was credited as the sole writer. Stone filmed the script (now called _U Turn_) in six weeks, and the film itself was released in late 1997…to somewhat negative reviews: It made back only a third of its budget, and got Stone a Razzie nomination for Worst Director. Oddly enough, while you won’t find much love for it from those who watched it at the time, _U Turn_ has gained something of a resurgence online as a mid-career gem for Stone.

Having actually watched _U Turn_ on the Internet’s recommendation…the haters were right. If _Natural Born Killers_ wrecked Stone’s writing ability, _U Turn_ proved that Stone could no longer do films that weren’t Big Dumb Objects even if he wanted to. If anything the haters may have understated how bad this movie is, because literally every change Stone & Rutkowski made to the script manages to be wrong:

(Note: It’s difficult to discussing one specific point of failure in _U Turn_ without bringing its the film’s failures as a whole. As such, there will be heavy spoilers; be forewarned).

THE PACING: This is actually the one major issue carried over from the original script: Ridley’s screenplay is ~120 pages (so about two hours), but most of the plot is within the first 30 and last 40 minutes, so the midsection comprises the buildup for the film’s plot threads. Stone resolves one thread early on and inexplicably removes another’s payoff but keeps the runtime the same – which relegates the film’s middle to superfluity. Other choices that Stone made would fit better in a 90-minute movie than a two-hour one, so Stone not trimming the runtime signals both his inattention to the script and a lack of any real guardrails on his self-indulgence.

THE CASTING: Tom Cruise was Oliver Stone’s original choice for protagonist Bobby Cooper (John Stewart in Ridley’s screenplay – for the sake of simplicity, I’ll refer to this character as just Bobby from here on out), but ended up turning it down. Stone then offered the part to Sean Penn, who turned it down due to scheduling conflicts; Bill Paxton was subsequently set to star, but had to pull out a week before filming, by which time Penn had become available.

That Penn was Stone’s second choice for the lead is a major red flag for the film. Tom Cruise can naturally pull off irritation without compromising charm, and Paxton did “affable lead with a dark secret” in _One False Move_. But antiheroic Sean Penn radiates nothing so much as sheer slimebaggery: This may be in fitting with noir conventions, but Penn is only ever shown pissed-off at everything, and he’s not able to keep the audience on his side. (Not incidentally, Penn held a grudge against Stone over his experience filming _U Turn_ for about a decade). There’s zero indication that Penn’s Bobby has any meaningful objection to killing for money (the film’s plot), and Bobby is so pointedly unsympathetic that it’s impossible to care what happens to him.

Oliver Stone also originally wanted Marlon Brando to play the blind Native beggar, and Sharon Stone to play mestiza deuteragonist Grace McKenna – these parts went to Jon Voight and Jennifer Lopez. It’s worth noting that for someone as vocal about the plight of Native Americans, Stone apparently hadn’t even contemplated hiring a Native actor for these roles (unless you count the Puerto Rican Jennifer as mestiza, but even then her casting was an olive branch for a failed Noriega casting session).

THE CAST: The Arizona town Bobby is stuck in is itself a villain of the movie: Ridley puts heavy emphasis on the heat’s deranging effects – preferable only to the reservation – but while the town (Sierra in Ridley’s script) is miserable, mechanic Darrell (Billy Bob Thornton) is the only fully unsympathetic character; everyone else is mostly just burnt out. This is the conceit of one of the film’s running gags: Teenager Jenny (Claire Danes) continually hits on Bobby, clearly an attempt to escape the town, and this pisses off her boyfriend Toby “TNT” Tucker (Joaquin Phoenix).

“Small towns are hell” is by far the part of the script Stone is most interested in, and this is heavily informed by his own conception of the Ugly American, and rural/suburban Americans as decadent toxic waste. To that effect he renames Sierra “Superior” and removes all sympathetic traits from _U Turn_’s supporting cast: Sheriff Virgil Potter (Powers Boothe) goes from resigned lawman to a gleefully corrupt hick. Toby “TNT” Tucker (Joaquin Phoenix) loses his father’s gruesome death to become just some asshole teen nuisance; Jake McKenna (Nick Nolte) goes from unambitious businessman to the film’s primary villain. Even Darrell gains a sizable gut in the film, at great cost to Billy Bob Thornton (he’s described as very lean in _Stray Dogs_). This cardboardification would be fine in a 90-minute movie, but for a two-hour runtime it’s gratuitously unpleasant and frankly smug and douchey – it’s rubbing the audience’s faces in the town’s awfulness to no real purpose.

Compounding the problem is that the cast are acting in entirely different movies, evidence that Stone is paying little attention to tone. Phoenix & Danes are acting in something like Ridley’s original script. Penn has been established as a straight-up scumbag; Nolte & Boothe are outright grotesques. Thornton and Voight, meanwhile, are comic characters of a vein that wouldn’t be out of place in a Farrelly Bros. movie (Thornton could maybe fit in a Coen Bros. film, but Voight is a bit too gross for that). Jennifer Lopez is the only actor giving a grounded performance – which is to say, the only performance with awareness of…

THE SEXUAL ABUSE PLOT: The central twist is that Jake McKenna is Grace’s father: He’d been raping her since her childhood, forced Grace to marry him after he murdered her Apache mother, and thus is why Grace wants Bobby to kill Jake. This twist is entirely a Stone/Rutkowski invention: In Ridley’s treatment Jake & Grace are unrelated – for that matter, his Jake is never a rapist – and Grace wants to kill Jake for his $100K because he’s too content to leave Sierra. (Jake’s motive is the same throughout both versions of the script: He considers Grace an ingrate, feels embarrassed by her cuckolding him & can get a small payout).

Problem #1 is that this is revealed a half-hour into the movie. There are no added wrinkles to the story, no real back and forth, indeed no indications Grace might be hiding anything; she is a sheep in sheep’s clothing, and indeed the third act confirms her story by showing Jake raping Grace. This streamlines the plot, but to the film’s detriment: It immediately makes Grace the most sympathetic character in the film, so the absence of complications to Grace’s story removes any real dilemma for Bobby – and by extension, a good portion of the runtime, as the poor pacing robs this of narrative momentum. (Roger Ebert noted in his 1.5-star review that the half-hour makes obvious that the characters only act as they do Because The Plot Said So, and this is probably what he meant by that remark – this is one of those changes that makes more sense in a 90-minute film). Cruise & Paxton could maybe sell Bobby’s dithering as qualms over killing, but with Penn this just comes off as rank cowardice.

Problem #2 is that Jennifer Lopez’ Grace is the rare sort of good performance that actually undermines the movie. Part of it is just the nature of the role has written – taken together the supporting cast’s characterizations suggest a farce or a broad black comedy, so Lopez’ dramatic performance makes everyone else look worse & Stone like he isn’t even trying to take the CSA plotline seriously. (That Grace is almost the only character to avoid caricature exacerbates the problem; of the supporting cast, only Claire Danes’ Jenny escapes unscathed, mostly due to how small her role is). Quite a few reviews have given Lopez shit for not selling Grace as a _femme fatale_, but this isn’t what Lopez is really going for with Grace so much as, first and foremost, an abused teenager. Lopez is competent at playing the seductress – but this is play-acting on Grace’s part, as her primary character traits are meekness and a childlike sensitivity; if you knocked 8-10 years off of Grace’s age (Lopez was 27 at the time of filming), very little about the performance would change. Lopez’ Grace is so devoid of malice that she never gives Bobby (or the audience) cause to be wary, and this only makes the film (and Bobby’s) later about-faces on her even more artificial & idiotic.

Problem #3 is that this characterization _is true to what Stone has actually written_, if not quite intended – having written Grace _to be_ a sexual abuse victim, Stone them seems oddly unwilling to make her _truly_ villainous, so he goes to great lengths to exculpate her whenever possible. This is evident in two of the movie’s key scenes:

In Ridley’s screenplay, when Bobby & Jake fight to the death at the McKenna residence, (Jake has gotten the drop on Bobby), Grace only intervenes in Bobby’s favor at the last second; this hesitation causes Bobby to accuse her of getting off on the violence. In the film Grace is scared, but is eager to help Bobby & improvises with him a plan to kill Jake after Plan A went awry.

More damning to Stone is Sheriff Virgil Potter’s fatal traffic stop. Ridley has Virgil make Bobby & Grace an offer: He knows the two killed Jake McKenna for his money, but since he _also_ wants out of the town, he’ll let them go if they give him ~1/3 of the $100K. This is an explicit threat on Virgil’s part, but he also indicates that he’ll happily leave them be if he gets his cut – Grace kills him while pretending to get it, before there’s any indication he’s lying. This isn’t a wholly _unreasonable_ act, but it is a morally ambiguous one (Grace’s initial defense focuses solely on the fact Virgil wanted the money), and combined with her hesitation against Jake it disinclines Bobby to give her the benefit of the doubt.

Stone just makes Sheriff Virgil Grace’s jilted lover, incidentally his one note of complexity under Stone – Grace promised she’d leave with him rather than Bobby, but Virgil was too craven to actually end Jake’s abuse. Here Grace kills Virgil while he’s actively trying to kill Bobby & openly wants to kill Grace. In both cases Stone’s Grace only kills in self-defense, which Bobby is witness to – Stone has thus created a situation where the film’s ostensible _femme fatale_ hasn’t actually done anything wrong. Ridley’s Grace (who, let’s recall, was never sexually abused) was still not particularly monstrous, so Stone’s softening of her can only be a choice, but it makes Bobby’s later betrayal of Grace all the more nonsensical.

(Problem #3.5 is the resolution of the running gag between Bobby, Jenny & TNT. Bobby eventually has enough of TNT’s shit & beats him to near-death before he goes to kill Jake McKenna, and in the original script this is why Sheriff Virgil Potter stops Bobby & Grace; he wants to congratulate Bobby, and this gives him the pretext to inquire about Jake’s murder. This dialogue isn’t in the film, thereby rendering TNT, Jenny & the entire gag plot-irrelevant – it’s not like it’s at odds with Stone’s replacement motive, so its removal is even more inexplicable).

Problem #4 is a flashback where a topless Grace is having sex with the sheriff. This flashback isn’t actually in the script: Jennifer Lopez has stated this was a last-minute excuse for Oliver Stone to see her naked, and that in the lead-up to filming it Stone came to her dressing room and asked her to disrobe (he was shamed into apologizing later by an assistant). While the script doesn’t _show_ the sex scene, dialogue from Grace is unambiguous that the Sheriff’s “relationship” with her is just sexual extortion – i.e. _rape_. (Lopez pointed this out in an attempt to dissuade Stone from filming her topless; she’s wearing a slip when Jake rapes her, so being nude of the sheriff would be out of character). This dialogue is removed from the final film, seemingly in exchange for the sex scene – this shows that Stone _knows_ how sympathetic Grace is, and is perfectly willing to downplay that for the sake of horniness, but not for the sake of the script.

JON VOIGHT: The blind Native beggar, and his apparently-dead dog, is a minor gag character in both versions of the screenplay, ultimately serving to forewarn Bobby before he kills Jake, after which he disappears from the script. The beggar’s warning takes different forms in the two scripts – Ridley’s admonition, building on the beggar’s previously spouting cryptic sayings & immediately following his pseudo-philosophical conversation with Bobby, is: “Thing’s ain’t always what they seem. You got to ask yourself: Is it worth it?” The twist is that the beggar is just bullshitting – he isn’t really blind, and his dog isn’t dead, just asleep. Under Stone he prefaces this remark with how chasing after a Hot Piece of Ass got him blinded (and thus the perils of The Duplicity of Wimmin), corroborated by a shot of his damaged eyes.

The beggar is the only character to be expanded rather than flattened by Stone: He’s given more airtime and a chance to monologue about the maltreatment of Native Americans, and is legitimated by Stone’s narrative. He is the worst character in the film – both due to execution and his serving as a font of Stone’s thoughtless/noxious racial & sexual politics.

First off: Jon Voight is just fucking terrible in this movie. 1997 wasn’t a good year for Voight performances – he also starred as the villains in _Anaconda_ and _Most Wanted_, the latter earning him a Razzie nomination – but the beggar is easily the worst of these turns, and fittingly his other Razzie nom for 1997. The film’s beggar doesn’t have a very dignified poverty to start with (he’s perpetually covered in snot), but Voight doesn’t even try to give him class; he plays him not as a “wise old Indian” so much as “doddering old fart.” There’s no indication before his final scene that he’s anything more than (ill-conceived) comic relief, so his warning lacks dramatic weight – if anything, he comes off as a parody of Stone’s idealization of Native Americans.

Native Americans are a common motif in Oliver Stone’s filmography. They serve to inspire Jim Morrison in _The Doors_; Mickey and Mallory Knox recognize the killing of a Native as their moral event horizon in _Natural Born Killers_; _U Turn_, in addition to the aforementioned monologue, centers around the mestiza Grace McKenna (in fact the ending takes after _Duel In the Sun_) – so on one level it is fitting that the most morally upstanding characters in _U Turn_ are Grace & the blind beggar. Yet if Stone is passionate about the plight of the Native American, he is not very intelligent about it, and in _U Turn_ he seems to have imported _Duel In the Sun_’s racial & sexual politics uncritically. 

The beggar’s warnings in each version of the script actually work better with the opposing script’s version of Grace. Stone’s warning would reinforce Ridley’s Grace (it’d just be gilding the lily), but it makes more sense for the Grace that Stone actually wrote to have Ridley’s ambiguous warning. As it is Stone makes no effort to sell the beggar’s credibility, but Voight’s performance merely aggravates the existing issue that Grace is much more credible than the beggar. Stone’s warning is explicitly misogynistic, so the obvious takeaway would be that Bobby’s listening to it is runaway paranoia and jealousy – but then why legitimize the beggar’s story? This implies we’re to take this at more or less face value, that Grace is a ticking time bomb – but Grace has shown no instability or even guile in the time Bobby’s known her, and as far as Bobby is concerned the beggar’s just some asshole who’s been pestering him for cash all day long. The only “risk factor” for Grace is that she was sexually abused, so this only serves to perpetuate DEFILED FOREVER horseshit: This might’ve flown for a noir villainess, but Lopez’ Grace is if anything the film’s heroine, so this is where the noir and Tragic Mestiza modes Stone’s writing in fatally undermine each other. On a racial level this is asking us to take the (presumably fully-indigenous) beggar’s musings over the mestiza Grace, solely because the latter is mestiza – a racism only compounded by the fact that Stone never even considered casting a Native actor to play the beggar. The most sympathetic reading of this ending is that Stone realized that his Grace was no longer even passably villainous, so he added the Bitches Be Treacherous anecdote to the beggar’s dialogue as compensation…only this just serves as incompetent “tell, don’t show” that is patently offensive into the bargain.

THAT STUPID FUCKING ENDING: And yet – and yet! – all of these flaws would be forgivable (flawed, but forgivable) if the ending were any good, and it’s worth discussing how John Ridley originally ended his screenplay:

On the drive out of Sierra, Bobby is unsettled enough by the Sheriff’s killing (and per a radio announcement, the ensuing manhunt) that he decides to ditch Grace. He & Grace come to blows over this – while Grace counters that the Sheriff would’ve killed them anyway, Bobby points out that they can’t really explain this to the cops, and Grace might try to sell him out again in a police confrontation. After telling Grace he’s leaving her once they reach California (and calling her “a lying, backstabbing bitch” to her face), the two decide to get rid of Jake’s body. Bobby trips over the precipice – he’s not sure if Grace pushed him or was trying to grab him – and is too injured to walk back up. A suspicious Grace doesn’t take up Bobby’s plan to pull him up via a rope in the trunk; Bobby in turn refuses to throw Grace the car keys. Grace takes the $100K into the desert, leaving Jake to his fate. It is 50 miles to the nearest town.

Here’s how Stone rewrites the ending:

Bobby & Grace stop to dump the Sheriff’s corpse when Bobby out of nowhere cold-cocks Grace & takes her gun – when asked why, he says it’s because Grace lied about her family & says he’s ditching her at California. Grace pushes Bobby off the precipice, and upon landing Bobby makes an obviously-insincere about-face asking Grace to help him. Grace inexplicably takes him up, descending the gorge to take his keys…but really to get Jake’s gun (and then Bobby’s keys), all while they’re pitching woo at each other. Grace closes in to kiss Bobby – upon which Bobby strangles Grace, but not before she mortally shoots him in the gut. Bobby struggles to the car & starts it…only for the radiator hose to blow out due to Darrell’s ineptitude as a mechanic. Bobby has a bitter laugh at his misfortune; cue credits.

This ending is the absolute worst of idiot plots. Bobby is actively being written as unreasonable to the nth degree: Grace has shown him nothing but love and has only killed her abusers, both in defense of herself & Bobby – her only moment of weakness is rolling on Bobby when Sheriff Potter stops them, but this is clearly a panic reaction rather than duplicity. The logistical headache of killing a policeman _would_ provide a reason to break with Grace, but this & the radio broadcast are omitted from the final film – so he just looks like an asshole and a fucking idiot. On Grace’s end: A femme fatale wouldn’t be stupid enough to get near let alone believe Bobby, and an ingenue wouldn’t believe someone who just turned on her for basically no reason, at least not enough for Bobby to get the drop on her. Stone intends this as tragedy for his tragic mestiza (hence the _Duel In the Sun_ reference), but this is just all so fucking stupid; and the much less sympathetic Bobby gets the better of her, so this only serves as an insult to anyone still invested in the movie. The entire chain of events is only possible if Grace and Bobby somehow lost 80 IQ points on the drive out of Arizona – Oliver Stone has destroyed this screenplay & its characters for the sake of a bad joke and an even worse reference. Fuck Oliver Stone, and motherfuck this movie.

All that said: Robert Richardson’s cinematography is pretty good. I think we can all agree on that.",0,25,1743162808.0,2025-03-28 11:53:28,False

*Levon Cade left behind a decorated military career in the black ops to live a simple life of working construction. However, when human traffickers kidnap his boss's daughter, his search to bring her home uncovers a world of corruption far greater than he ever could have imagined.*

**Metacritic:** [N/A (updating)](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-working-man/)

**Some Reviews:**

[JoBlo's Movie Network](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/573) \- [Chris Bumbray](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/chris-bumbray)

>Jason Statham and David Ayer have a nice thing going. *The Beekeeper* revitalized their careers to a certain extent, with Ayer putting a superb polish on what could have been a run-of-the-mill action flick, turning into perhaps Statham’s best solo action vehicle. And now, they’re back at it again with the Sylvester Stallone-penned *A Working Man*, which is based on the novel “Levon’s Trade” by Chuck Dixon (a way better title than the Seagal-like *A Working Man*). 

[Casey's Movie Mania](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/3688) \- [Casey Chong](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/casey-chong)

>Some of the shortcomings aside, it’s worth noting that A Working Man is the first part of Chuck Dixon’s *Levon Cade* series, which has so far released a total of 11 books. For now, the movie gets off to a decent, though uneven beginning for a franchise starter and if there’s a sequel in the pipeline — depending on the first movie’s box-office result, of course — here’s hoping it improves for the next round.

[The Guardian - Jesse Hassenger](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/26/a-working-man-review-jason-statham)

>At its best, a movie like A Working Man functions as an update to the hard-boiled detective story, with a resilient bruiser conducting his own off-books missing-person investigation. There’s a little of that juice as Levon does some amateur undercover work as a drug buyer, cozying up to a motorcycle gang (the aforementioned leader sits on a chrome throne, another touch that feels like Ayer’s doing). But Stallone and Ayer don’t have the patience for too much skullduggery; skullsmashery is more their thing, and as an action movie, A Working Man doesn’t reach the giddy highs of Statham’s best.

[Screen Rant - Mary Kassel](https://screenrant.com/a-working-man-movie-review/)

>It doesn't take an active imagination to see where the future of *A Working Man* is going. A few plots are left unresolved. Levon still has to win custody of his young daughter, paving the way for a sequel or two if the film makes a profit. Statham has proved himself an asset at the box office, and when it comes to movies like *A Working Man*, a critical reception has little to do with the project's performance. It's a mindless good time, and I'll be interested to see where the franchise goes.

[NextBestPicture - Dan Bayer](https://nextbestpicture.com/a-working-man/)

>For better or worse, “A Working Man” is pure brute force, barrelling through its standard (if overstuffed) plot with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, pummeling you into submission with its hard-hitting (if uninspired) fight scenes. You may not be wowed by the action on display here, but you feel every single body blow and gunshot. That’s exactly what you expect from a Statham vehicle, and that’s what “A Working Man” delivers, even if it doesn’t give you any more than that.

[The Reel Bits - Richard Gray](https://thereelbits.com/2025/03/27/review-a-working-man/)

>While never destined to revolutionise the genre, Ayer and Stallone have struck upon a reliable formula in a ready-made franchise package. One could happily consume these like fast food every couple of years, safe in the knowledge that there’s always another job for this working man right around the corner.

[Deadline](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2256) \- [Pete Hammond](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/pete-hammond)

>Ayer has made a bunch of films I really liked, particularly the cop drama *End Of Watch* which had a better role for Pena opposite Jake Gyllenhaal, and Brad Pitt’s WW2 tank epic, *Fury.* Here as in *Beekeeper,* he delivers a tightly wound action showcase for his star and keeps it moving along.

[Variety](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/466) \- [Peter Debruge](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/peter-debruge)

>This wasn’t how I envisioned Ayer’s career shaping up... A few of his movies are very good, but it increasingly feels like he’s recycling old plots, the way straight-to-tape action movies did in the late 20th century.

[IndieWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/226) \- [David Ehrlich](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/david-ehrlich)

>Underwhelming as many of the action setpieces are in this movie, “A Working Man” more than makes up for that on the strength of its deep and memorable supporting cast, a rogues’ gallery of deviant weirdos.",15,71,1743015690.0,2025-03-26 19:01:30,False

The answer: Not much.

There's 2 official basketball games shown, the 1st shows quite a bit of action. From what they show us, we see Jim's team outscore the opponent 18-3.

Before the 2nd game, there's 2 scenes where we see Jim playing basketball. First, 1-on-1 vs Reggie (Ernie Hudson), but they say they don't keep score, and then the basketball in the rain scene after Bobby's memorial service.

Jim and Mickey quit / are kicked off the team after the 2nd game. There is no more basketball shown in the rest of the film, other than them briefly seeing Neutron playing in the All-American Game on the tv in the bar.

backtoblack,back to black,1jjhvwo,"Fightclub genuinely changed me, it's like an comprehensible Christopher Nolan movie.","This post is not satire in any nature, I'm writing this movie review because WOW! last night I stayed up watching movies that I've been pushing back like ""Inglorious Bastards"", ""No Country for Old Men"". Then "" Fightclub "", I knew about the DID the main character had, and to be honest I hosently thought it was going to be like ""DragonBall Evolution"" level of production. 


The movie starts and thoight it looked crummy, I didn't like the Scott Pilgrim intro: ""I'm here because of her..."", but when you started seeing 'Him', it got way more interesting interesting. 


I knew nothing about this movie and when the actual Fightclub started I thought, he's going to fight and then go somewhere, fight more people and the other identity was just a way to be himself better.


When the First guy at the door in all black shows up I'm wondering why there's another plot point at the end of the movie, the movie is halfway done. Then the soap, zen garden and remodel of the house as if the main character is only experiencing a fraction of his life. 


""Where's Tyler?"" The whole plot point of Bob's death waking up the original personality, or at least suppressing Tyler's was cool. Imagine if you had DID and you find out one time your famous, half of you is a leader and just different. That's cool, I've never seen another movie do this, closest thing is Moon knight and that was meh.


The fight between the two personalities was really cool. If you've been awake for more than 24hours on little sleep you know the feeling of calm bliss, while you feel so delayed. I don't know it just engages me, this movie is so interesting.


The plot in whole: I love movies that just have a plot that snowballs. Most movies are linear, bad guy did bad thing, the hero will save the day. Movies like Valerian (Definition of plot overload), where the plot just keeps going and going is so realistic. In life you don't have one problem and one goal, you have many: Job, school, personal, financial. In Fightclub there's the plot of Tyler, the ever-changing background and things happening around the main character, again the soap into explosives, the Fightclub into terrorists, them into him, him getting rid of him. Him taking his life back. 


That movie man was just peak Cinema, recent movies are just made for money, that genre of movie is a dying breed. There won't be much more of a somewhat random actor doing a somewhat random thing that leads into interest and just WOW factor, I think of this movie alongside TENET.


Edward Norton 10/10


Brad pit 10/10.

backtoblack,back to black,1jj2j39,"March 21-23 Box Office Recap: It was another terrible weekend, as 'Snow White' flopped with an awful $85.3 million worldwide, against a $270 million budget. Meanwhile, 'The Alto Knights' also flopped with just $3.1 million domestically.","https://preview.redd.it/t9od7mdwgpqe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dbdf627ab9d7355869c0772f7334f9c0b3a6c65

Another brutal weekend at the box office.

Despite topping the box office, ***Snow White*** massively flopped in its opening weekend, indicating it was a bad apple after all. But that wasn't the only flop this weekend. WB also released ***The Alto Knights***, and it had one of the worst debuts for a film playing at over 2,500 theaters. Oh and there was also the long-delayed debut of ***Magazine Dreams***, which unsurprisingly tanked in 815 theaters.

The Top 10 earned a combined $68.5 million this weekend. That's off a rough 30.3% from last year, when ***Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire*** topped the box office.

Debuting in first place, ***Snow White*** flopped with just $42.2 million in 4,200 theaters. This debut is lower than the live-action ***Dumbo*** remake ($45.9 million), coincidentally another adaptation of a very old Disney property. It's so far off from other recent films like ***The Little Mermaid*** ($95.5M), ***Maleficent*** ($69.4M), and ***Cinderella*** ($67.8M).

The bad news don't stop there. These numbers are eerily similar to the debut of ***The Marvels*** ($46.1 million), which also had a similar budget to ***Snow White*** ($270 million). So yep, ***Snow White*** is performing right on par with one of the biggest flops in movie history.

While Disney has had success with their live-action remakes, there's always that black sheep that deviates from the formula and that's the case with ***Snow White***. The film had a similar case to ***Dumbo***, in that the original films are very old (the original ***Snow White*** is 88 years old and ***Dumbo*** is 84 years old). While the public is aware of these films and know they're iconic, perhaps their popularity hasn't been as big as other animated films like ***The Lion King***, ***Aladdin*** or ***Beauty and the Beast***.

It didn't help that ***Snow White*** has been done to death for the past decades. So it falls into the same problem as other stories like ***Robin Hood***, ***The Three Musketeers***, or ***Sherlock Holmes***, in that the public can recognize them but that doesn't mean they'll watch everything with them. Of course, some hit bigger than others. In 2012, ***Snow White and the Huntsman***, a dark reimagining, made almost $400 million worldwide. Simply put, the Disney remake didn't offer much to differentiate itself from other adaptations.

Alright, now we have to address two big problems with the film, which are main factors for its performance. The first involves the Seven Dwarfs, which are, obviously, pivotal to the story. Back in 2022, Peter Dinklage expressed his frustration with the film, deeming it a ""backward story"". So Disney decided to simply... make the Dwarfs with CGI instead of casting actors with dwarfism. And the design used for the film simply looks... awful. Even though Dinklage faced backlash for his comment, it was Disney who made the decision to listen and act upon it. But that's not everything.

Rachel Zegler has been the subject of media attention since 2022, when she made comments joking about the Prince and Snow White's characterization in the original film. These comments have been in the eye of the public for the past years, drawing negative attention to the remake. Gal Gadot didn't escape criticism either; not just for her perceived lack of acting range, but because of her Israel support. Whether you agree or not with everything just mentioned, it's clear the general audience wasn't content in the slightest with anything.

So that's basically it. It's a simply a factor of so many decisions that went awry, as well as an incredibly high $270 million budget. Disney knew this, which is why they scaled back on the premieres and press junkets for the film. Add in very weak reviews (44% on RT), and the film has already lost so many people.

According to Disney, 68% of the audience was female and 47% was in the 18-34 demographic. Even though it's a family film, only 15% of the audience was 17 and under. So kids were pretty much not interested in the film.

The long term prospects for ***Snow White*** don't look great. It received a lukewarm ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is worse than any of the Disney live-action remakes, and suggests word of mouth will only be a bit better than its reviews. With competition like ***A Minecraft Movie*** coming up, ***Snow White*** is unlikely to leg out and it's set to be one of the lowest Disney remakes. For now, a domestic total around $110 million is likely. Which means it will make less money than ***Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs*** ($184.9 million) and that's not even adjuste for inflation! Another failure for Disney this year.

Steven Soderbergh's ***Black Bag*** kept the second place spot, earning $4.2 million this weekend. That's a good 44% drop from last weekend, although its numbers are still way too small to make it look notable. Through 10 days, the film has earned $14.7 million, and it will finish with over $20 million domestically.

***Captain America: Brave New World*** may have weak word of mouth, but the very lack of competition is working wonders. The film eased just 29%, adding $4 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $192 million.

After topping the box office last week, ***Novocaine*** felt a gut punch this weekend. The film dropped a very rough 58%, earning $3.6 million this weekend and falling to fourth place. That's just brutal, although it's a better drop than Jack Quaid's previous film, ***Companion***, which collapsed 67.7% (but ***Companion*** faced the Super Bowl in its second weekend). Through 10 days, the film has earned a meager $15.6 million, and won't make it much further than $20 million, especially with three wide releases coming up this weekend.

With the loss of PLF screens, ***Mickey 17*** suffered another rough drop this weekend. It dropped 51% and added $3.6 million this weekend. The film has earned a very weak $40 million, and with the film hitting PVOD tomorrow, it will continue falling. For now, it should finish with around $45 million domestically.

It's not until sixth place where we find the other newcomer, WB's ***The Alto Knights***. Debuting in 2,651 theaters, the film flopped with a horrific $3.1 million this weekend. That's one of Robert De Niro's worst debuts as leading man, as well as the 26th worst debut for a film playing at over 2,500 theaters.

The film achieved some notoriety, given that it was the first film greenlit by David Zaslav when he joined Warner Bros. Discovery back in 2022. But there were already signs that the film would struggle. For starters, director Barry Levinson had a very successful career... but that peaked in the 90s. His films in the 21st century have been flopping across the board, suggesting he might not deliver the quality he once commanded. Not to mention that gangster films haven't fared well in the past few years.

There's also the very weird decision to cast Robert De Niro in the roles of both Vito Genovese and Frank Costello, even though they are not twins nor anything. WB has also moved the release date, and the first trailer didn't premiere till two months ago, which is a very short release window for a major film. And despite the amount of names attached, reviews were very poor (39% on RT). The film simply couldn't overcome the ""been there, done that"" feeling that plagued other gangster films.

According to WB, 58% of the audience was male. Unsurprisingly, it skewed massively old; 77% of the audience was 35 and over, and 33% over 55. They gave it a middling ""B"" on CinemaScore, which is simply not good for its long-term prospects. With many new releases coming up, ***The Alto Knights*** will disappear quickly from theaters. It would be a surprise if it finished anywhere close to $10 million.

***The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie*** added $1.8 million this weekend. That's a 41% drop, which isn't bad, but it's kinda rough for an animated film. Through 10 days, the film has earned just $6.5 million so far. Despite these low numbers, Ketchup looks content with its performance, given that they are currently bidding $50 million to acquire ***Coyote vs. Acme***.

In eighth place, Neon's ***The Monkey*** eased 39%, adding $1.5 million. That takes its domestic total to $37.8 million.

In ninth place, DreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** dropped 42% and added $1.4 million this weekend. The film has amassed $95.6 million and it's on its last legs to hit the $100 million milestone.

Rounding up the Top 10 was ***The Last Supper***, which added $1.3 million this weekend. That's off 51% from last week, which is a very bad drop for a Christian drama. Through 10 days, the film has earned $5.3 million so far.

2 years after its debut in Sundance, ***Magazine Dreams*** has finally hit theaters. Released by Briarcliff in 815 theaters, the film tanked with just $701,365 this weekend. This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone; you really expect the public to pay a ticket for a film with Jonathan Majors?  

RLJ Entertainment also released ***Ash*** in 1,136 theaters, but the film flopped with a terrible $689,144. Expect it to fade quickly.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Snow White*** led the overseas box office, yet its numbers were far below the most pessimistic scenario. It debuted with a very weak $43.1 million overseas, for a terrible $85.3 million worldwide debut. Wow, not even hitting $100 million is pathetic. The film had very weak numbers in the UK ($5.1M), Mexico ($4.1M), Italy ($4M), France ($3M) and Spain ($2.6M). With a debut this soft, you can count on something: the film is not making it to $300 million worldwide, and $250 million could be in danger if it collapses. As mentioned, this cost $270 million. Big, big failure.

***Mickey 17*** added $8.7 million this weekend, taking its worldwide numbers to $109.8 million. The best markets are South Korea ($19.6M), UK ($7.5M), France ($6.8M), Germany ($3.6M) and Mexico ($3.3M).

***Captain America: Brave New World*** added $3.1 million, allowing the film to cross $200 million worldwide. The best markets are the UK ($22.5M), Mexico ($16M), China ($14.4M), France ($14M) and Korea ($11.4M).

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Love Hurts* | Feb/7 | Universal | $5,800,440 | $15,683,090 | $17,561,938 | $18M

- Well, it truly lived up to its title. ***Love Hurts*** has ended its run with a very poor $17 million, below its already low $18 million. While Ke Huy Quan is in the middle of a return to films, this was an offer he was better off turning down. He reportedly accepted the role after Steven Spielberg convinced him. Ouch.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

There's three wide releases this weekend. And while ***Snow White*** will probably continue at the top spot, one film will fight to be as close as possible.

That film is Amazon MGM's ***A Working Man***, starring Jason Statham. The plot is... come on, you watch a Jason Statham film for the plot? What's important is that it's action, that's it. Statham is a very reliable name, with his latest film, ***The Beekeeper***, earning over $150 million worldwide last year. 

There's also the release of A24's ***Death of a Unicorn***, which stars Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega as a father and daughter who accidentally hit and kill a unicorn, causing them to be hunted down by its parents. Despite a promising premise, reviews out of SXSW aren't glowing (currently at a middling 64% on RT).

The other release is Universal/Blumhouse's ***The Woman in the Yard***, which follows a family that sees a strange woman, dressed in all black, staying in their yard. Blumhouse is currently not at its best; their previous film, ***Wolf Man***, was one of their few box office flops. With a very generic premise and lack of buzz, it'd be a surprise if this film got close to $10 million this weekend.

backtoblack,back to black,1jhlafk,[Movie Review] Companion (2025) is a really fun black comedy about sci-fi relationships,"COMPANION (2025) was a film I was back and forth reviewing due to being a science fiction black comedy. If I had to define its genre, I'd say it's cyberpunk lite. A story that could basically be summarized as ""What if Blade Runner starred the machines and had really stupid people after them?"" Despite the comedic elements or perhaps because of them, the film deals with a lot of incredibly dark subject matter and touches on numerous themes of both technology as well as socialization. 

It's sort of an interesting comparison to EX MACHINA, which had the idea of our machines as wholly inhuman but mankind confusing them for people. This is instead the story of us making our machines human enough that we just use it as an excuse to treat them as how we already treat ourselves (which is like shit). There's a strong feminist theme to the movie that underscores the comedy and slasher movie vibe as our heroine struggles to understand what her ""boyfriend"" now wants to murder her.

The marketing spoiled a lot of this movie in a manner like CAPTAIN AMERICA: BRAVE NEW WORLD as one of the biggest twists comes around the fifteen minute mark but is spoiled by the poster. Indeed, I wasn't even aware it was meant to be a surprise until I watched this movie with my nieces. They had no familiarity with the movie and thus were completely taken off guard when it happened. If you can watch the movie unspoiled or with people who don't know anything other than the title, then I recommend it. Otherwise, note, that the rest of the review will treat this initial reveal as a given.

The premise for Companion is that Irish (Sophie Thatcher) and Josh (Jack Quaid) are a sickeningly happy couple that are visiting their Russian friend's house for the weekend. It is an incredibly luxurious house in the middle of nowhere and they'll be joined by several friends. It is in the near future with self-driving cars and a variety of other luxury items that seem to be available only to the super rich, though Jack isn’t one of them. One of the guests, Kat (Megan Suri), is initially very hostile to Iris and she doesn't know why. Sergey (Rupert Friend) gets aggressive with Iris and events spiral out of control when he's killed.

Which turns out to have been the plan all along as Iris discovers that's what she was programmed to do all along. Iris, much to her shock and horror, is a companion robot for Josh. A sort of sexy Tamagotchi that was given a set of fake memories and a willingness to please that overrides all other considerations. Rather than the superhumans of Blade Runner, companions are deliberately made to be no smarter or stronger than ""regular"" humans with the ability of their owners to make them even dumber or weaker. Josh is fond of his companion robot but no more so than a pet and arguably even less than that as he's willing to sacrifice her as part of his plan to murder Sergey then rob him. Unfortunately, he's careless with his master control and he's turned up Iris' survival instincts.

Much of the movie is, essentially, not so veiled commentary on ""nice guy"" misogyny. Josh is good looking and willing to put on a pleasant enough face around his girlfriend but only when she's subservient to him. Ultimately, she's a convenience and someone that he gets increasingly violent toward as he finds his plans thwarted. We also discover just how fragile Josh's self-esteem is. The fact Jack Quaid is the kind of actor that would be the dorky but handsome lead in a romantic comedy, makes his transformation even more shocking. Like a slowly boiling kettle, we also see how the escalation grows from dismissiveness to furious rage.

The movie's humor comes from the same source as the movie's terror. The murderers are not particularly competent at their crimes but that doesn't mean they're not dangerous. All of them, even the more sympathetic ones, think of Iris as an appliance that needs to be destroyed. The absolute lack of sympathy from everyone around here is surprisingly well realized. Sophie Thatcher beautifully embodies both the idealized retro-girlfriend with her 1950s-esque inspired look as well as the increasingly capable Iris as she realizes her only way out may be blocked by what she was made to be. I had a lot of fun with this movie.",71,25,1742684882.0,2025-03-22 23:08:02,False
backtoblack,back to black,1jef86d,Mortal Kombat II: Should Cole Young Die or Evolve? - A Discussion on Character Development,"The notion that good writers should simply kill off poorly received characters is, in my opinion, a common misconception in the world of film and television. In reality, skilled writers often take on the challenge of improving and developing these characters, transforming them into compelling additions to the story.

Consider the case of James Norrington from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Initially introduced as a somewhat one-dimensional character, Norrington underwent significant development in the sequel, becoming a more complex and intriguing[^(\[1\])](https://www.looper.com/156256/characters-who-were-much-better-in-the-sequel/). This transformation demonstrates that good writers can take a lacklustre character and breathe new life into them, rather than simply writing them out of the story.

The idea that ""if they're good writers, they'll kill him"" is fundamentally flawed. As renowned screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, points out; ""Every good screenwriter that I know of spends an awful lot of time rewriting""[^(\[2\])](http://www.screenwritingisrewriting.com/quotes-on-writing--rewritng.html). This sentiment applies not just to dialogue and plot, but to character development as well. Good writers understand that characters, like real people, have the potential for growth and change. To back this up, Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of Top Gun, Black Hawk Down, and, Pirates of the Caribbean said, ""If you don’t fall in love with the character you’re lost.  I don’t care how big the explosions are.""[^(\[2\])](http://www.screenwritingisrewriting.com/quotes-on-writing--rewritng.html) This underscores the significance of investing in character growth rather than simply eliminating poorly received characters, even if through fantastical methods.

In the case of Cole from Mortal Kombat, simply killing him off in the first few minutes of the sequel would be a missed opportunity. Instead, skilled writers would see this as a chance to flesh out the character, address the criticisms from the first film, and potentially create a compelling arc that could surprise and engage audiences.

It's worth noting that some of the most beloved characters in film history have undergone significant rewrites and development. For instance, the character of Ahsoka Tano from Star Wars: The Clone Wars initially faced strong criticism as an ""annoying brat"" when introduced in the 2008 film. However, over the course of the animated series and beyond, Ahsoka evolved into a fan favourite, with her character growth and complexity winning over audiences[^(\[3\])](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/pd4avj/comment/hanjvi8/). This transformation from a widely disliked character to a beloved one demonstrates the power of skilled writing and character development in storytelling.

In a franchise like Mortal Kombat, where death is often just a portal to another realm, character development becomes even more crucial. As Ed Boon recently hinted, ""There are ways to bring dead characters back""[^(\[4\])](https://www.cbr.com/mortal-kombat-2-how-kano-return/). This unique approach to mortality in the series underscores the importance of evolving characters rather than simply eliminating them. By investing in character growth, Mortal Kombat can create richer storylines and deeper connections with its audience, ensuring the franchise's longevity and continued success.

So, while it might be tempting to call for the elimination of poorly received characters, such as Cole, true writing uses the ability to transform these characters into integral parts of the story. As the audience, we shouldn't demand the death of a character as a quick fixes that ultimately rob us of a potentially rich story; but should instead be open to the possibility of character growth and redemption so that the series can evolve and grow.",0,28,1742330209.0,2025-03-18 20:36:49,False
backtoblack,back to black,1jdoypp,"March 14-16 Box Office Recap: It was the worst weekend of the year, as 'Novocaine', 'Black Bag', 'The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie' and 'Opus' underwhelmed. Meanwhile, 'Mickey 17' collapses a steep 61% on its second weekend.","https://preview.redd.it/tc7irrhhmbpe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=810ea1720f0b3db3221738848d968cb2f2c3bbf6

It was a brutal weekend for theaters.

Despite five films opening in wide release, there wasn't a single film above $10 million this weekend, and all of them fell under their modest expectations. This allowed ***Novocaine*** to take the top spot, while last week's champ ***Mickey 17*** had a terrible second weekend drop.

The whole line-up earned a combined $50.8 million this weekend. That's not only a steep 42% drop from last year, but it's also the worst weekend of the year so far. There were so many empty screenings this weekend.

Debuting in first place, Paramount's ***Novocaine*** earned $8.8 million in 3,365 theaters. Quite weak, but as mentioned, strong enough to get the top spot this weekend. For reference, Jack Quaid's previous film, ***Companion***, earned $9.3 million in its first weekend. 

Even though it hit the top spot, one can't help but feel like the film should've done higher than this. After all, the competiton was insanely weak and Paramount spend a lot on marketing, including a Super Bowl spot. But despite a selling point (an action comedy with a man who cannot feel pain), ***Novocaine*** failed to diffentiate itself from other streaming action flicks. The audience simply wasn't big enough for that, even if reviews were positive (82% on RT).

According to Paramount, 58% of the audience was male, and 54% was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a very middling ""B"" on CinemaScore, which is not very encouraging for its long-term prospects. Maybe it can hold on well, but for now, it would be a surprise if ***Novocaine*** came anywhere close to $30 million by the end of its run. 

In second place, Steven Soderbergh's ***Black Bag*** debuted with $7.6 million in 2,705 theaters. This debut already surpassed of Soderbergh's previous film, ***Presence*** ($6.9 million), although that film played in just 1,750 theaters and with a far smaller marketing spend.

On paper, this should be a very good debut. But the problem is that the film cost $50 million, putting it in even more pressure to deliver better numbers. This marked Michael Fassbender's latest financial misfire, after the failure of ***Next Goal Wins*** back in 2023. It's hard to think on something that could have improved these numbers. After all, the reviews are so damn fantastic (97% on RT, 85/100 on Metacritic). Like seriously, what could've been done?

According to Focus Features, 56% of the audience was male. It skewed old; 59% of the audience was 35 and over. They gave it a middling ""B"" on CinemaScore, although that's better than ***Presence***'s ""C+"". Generally, a film aimed at older audiences leg out, so perhaps ***Black Bag*** could surprise in the long run. Nevertheless, no need to worry for Soderbergh; a few days ago, he confirmed that his new film, ***The Christophers***, has wrapped and could actually premiere this year. Wow, 3 films in a single year is crazy.

After is disappointing debut last weekend, ***Mickey 17*** didn't save face on its second weekend. Despite keeping PLF screens (including IMAX), the film collapsed 61%, earning just $7.4 million this weekend. That's absolutely brutal, but sadly unsurprising, given the film's tepid word of mouth.

Through 10 days, ***Mickey 17*** has made just $33.3 million. And with ***Snow White*** premiering and taking away its PLF screens, it's gonna have another steep drop this weekend. WB has also pretty much given up; they announced the film will hit PVOD on March 25, just 18 days after its release date. Right now, a $45 million lifetime is the absolutely ceilling for ***Mickey 17***.

In fourth place, ***Captain America: Brave New World*** eased just 32% and added $5.6 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $185.6 million, and it looks like it might hit $200 million after all. A hollow victory, nevertheless.

Debuting in fifth place, ***The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie*** flopped with just $3.1 million in 2,827 theaters. That's Ketchup Entertainment's biggest debut, but it's not really saying much, considering most of their films have flopped. We won't even bother comparing it to the previous ***Looney Tunes*** films.

This debut is not surprising. WB didn't really intend for the film to hit theaters, it was actually set for their Max streaming service. Due to a restructuring, they decided to shop the film, with Ketchup acquiring it. But still, the popularity of the ***Looney Tunes*** appears to have cooled in the past few decades. While ***Space Jam*** was a success, ***Back in Action*** flopped back in 2003 and ***Space Jam: A New Legacy*** failed to connect with audiences. Focusing the film on Porky and Daffy Duck while also omitting other characters like Bugs Bunny made it look like a non-event for many. Simply put, it's hard to ask for better numbers here.

According to Ketchup Entertainment, 64% of the audience was male and 69% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. The film failed to connect with kids; they represented just 17% of the audience. They gave it a middling ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is quite mediocre for a family film. With competition like ***Snow White*** and ***Minecraft*** on their way, this film will vanish quickly from theaters.

Pinnacle Peak released the Christian drama ***The Last Supper*** in 1,575 theaters, although it made just a weak $2.7 million this weekend. Even with an ""A–"" on CinemaScore, it's unlikely the film stays long in theaters.

***Paddington in Peru*** eased just 28%, adding $2.6 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $41.2 million so far.

DreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** eased 25% and earned $2.5 million. With this, the film has earned $92.8 million, and it's fighting to hit the $100 million milestone.

In ninth place, Neon's ***The Monkey*** eased 36% and added $2.4 million this weekend. The film has amassed $35.2 million so far.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Focus Features' ***Last Breath***, which fell from the third spot. It dropped 44% and added $2.2 million. This took its lifetime gross to $18.5 million.

A24's ***Opus*** finished all the way till 12th place, where it flopped with just $1 million in 1,764 theaters. This is not a surprise, given that A24 chose to scale back on marketing after the film received weak reviews in Sundance. With a ""C+"" on CinemaScore, this film will disappear quickly.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Mickey 17*** added $15.6 million overseas, taking its worldwide numbers to $90.4 million. Its best markets are South Korea ($17.9M), the UK ($5.8M), France ($5.3M), Germany ($2.8M) and Mexico ($2.5M). Not much to be said here.

***Captain America: Brave New World*** added $6 million, taking its worldwide numbers to $388 million. The best markets are the UK ($22M), Mexico ($15.2M), China ($14.4M), France ($13.6M) and Korea ($11.3M). By next week, it should finally hit $400 million worldwide. Respectable number, but not really a success.

***Black Bag*** debuted in 37 markets, where it earned $4.3 million, for a $12 million worldwide debut. Its best numbers were in France ($1.2M), UK ($1.1M) and Australia ($600K). It will continue expanding to more countries, although clearly not gonna be enough to recover its $50 million budget.

***Novocaine*** didn't feel love in the rest of the world. Debuting in 19 countries, it made a very weak $1.8 million this weekend, for a $10.6 million worldwide debut. It had very weak debuts in Mexico ($607K), South Korea ($154K) and Indonesia ($126K/No. 3). Ouch.

With $2.054 billion, ***Ne Zha 2*** has passed ***The Force Awakens*** to become the fifth highest grossing film ever.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Wicked* | Nov/22 | Universal | $112,508,890 | $473,231,120 | $795,420,331 | $150M
*Companion* | Jan/31 | Warner Bros. | $9,300,113 | $20,809,101 | $36,504,351 | $10M

- ***Wicked*** has ended its run with a fantastic $795 million worldwide. A dazzling result, but the film managed to surpass our wildest expectations. It was not front-loaded as many feared, becoming the rare $100 million opener to hit a 4x multiplier. If this film surprised you, just wait for ***Wicked: For Good*** this year to get even higher.

- ***Companion*** has ended its run after just 6 weeks, with a very weak $36 million worldwide. While the budget was $10 million, Deadline reported that WB spent a further $29 million in marketing, explaining that the film would be considered a success if it finished with $40 million-$50 million domestically. A figure that it couldn't even reach worldwide. Despite great reviews, the audience was very niche, and the film collapsed very quickly. Maybe it will find a life in streaming.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We're getting 3 wide releases, with a clear #1. But it's very likely all three are heading for some ugly numbers.

After months of bad PR (among other things), Disney's live-action remake of ***Snow White*** is finally getting theaters after so many delays. Disney has had success with these films, and they're coming off the success of ***Mufasa***, which made over $700 million worldwide. But it looks like ***Snow White*** will be closer to the failure of ***Dumbo*** instead. Pre-sales are looking rough and Disney has already cancelled many events in advance, suggesting the film is not gonna surprise in a good way. This film cost $240 million (some estimating $269 million), putting even more pressure.

Warner Bros. is also releasing Barry Levinson's gangster film ***The Alto Knights***, which stars Robert De Niro in a dual role as 1950s mob bosses Vito Genovese and Frank Costello. A notable aspect about the film; it's the first film that was greenlit when David Zaslav took charge as CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery. But with a low marketing spend (the first trailer was released just two months ago), it's likely that the film won't be able to find an audience.

Briarcliff is also releasing Elijah Bynum's ***Magazine Dreams***, which stars Jonathan Majors as a bodybuilder. You may have heard of this film before, and it's because it premiered in Sundance back in January 2023. After earning some great reviews, Searchlight bought the film and scheduled it for December 2023. But then Majors' controversies (and subsequent conviction) caused Searchlight to drop the film. Don't expect good numbers for this film.

backtoblack,back to black,1jdf4wp,"Re-watched Menace II Society and Dead Presidents and I have no clue how the Hughes brothers never became as big as the other 90s directors like PT Anderson, Tarantino, Fincher, etc. Dead Presidents especially is one of the deepest period dramas I have ever seen and it was done for no money.","First things first, I absolutely dig the fact that the Hughes brothers are shamelessly Martin Scorsese fans and their homages are clear as day. You can tell they were heavily influenced by goodfellas and a lot of Scorsese's techniques from that movie. I think they use it far better than PT Anderson did a few years later with Boogie Nights where it comes off as copying more than actually creating a homage. The overall stories and characters in both movies are so layered and polished. I think both movies are about how as a society these young men are set up to fail and both movies chronicle their downfalls. 

Dead Presidents to me is their true masterpiece. Larenz Tate gives what should've been a star making performance in this movie. They show brilliantly how in the 60s black men during the war were taken into the Vietnam war when they had absolutely nothing and then chewed up and spit out of the system and sent back into these neighborhoods  with severe PTSD and nothing to fall back on. The Chris Tucker scene where he explains his issues post war with PTSD and anxiety and the end where Tate explains he's a war hero and he gets zero leniency are so powerful to me. It's a shame.both brothers after that and their brilliant pimp documentary became directors for hire. ",70,26,1742224747.0,2025-03-17 15:19:07,False
backtoblack,back to black,1jbi2cd,Flow and Bob Dylan - A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall,"I saw both *Flow* as well as *A Complete Unknown* recently and having listened to *Hard Rain* several times over the last few days I couldn't help but make a connection to the movie Flow.  

Let me start by saying that I think the film Flow is best read as a metaphor for experience and struggle against nature.  I don't think most of its themes are meant to stand for literal meaning or ideological significance but rather create an enduring and evocative story about the journey through life that means many things to many people.  That is not to say that individual interpretations are not valid just that the film is more abstract than literal in its meaning and trying to say things like ""the mirror is supposed to represent social media"" is not broadly useful in analysis.

That said I am going to make several claims below  that assert  connections between the film and the song.  Some of these may be accurate some may not but my overall theses is that the song has a strong influence over this move and they share many of the same themes that may be useful in understanding each.

HEAVY SPOILERS BELOW, watch Flow before reading.  I encourage you to listen to the song and read the lyrics prior to reading this as well to make your own connections or lack there of.

*Hard Rain* Lyrics: [https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/hard-rains-gonna-fall/](https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/hard-rains-gonna-fall/)

*Flow* Plot: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow\_(2024\_film)#Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(2024_film)#Plot)

Starting more generally both Hard Rain and Flow are deeply poetic, filled with surreal and apocalyptic imagery.   It is raining for much of the film and seems very possible that a ""hard rain"" is what caused the ""flood.""  Additionally the song has several references to water, flooding, and oceans throughout.

Lets take a look at individual lyrics as there are many seeming connections.

>Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?  
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?

The primary character of the song are ""my blue eyed son"" and ""my darling young one"".  In Flow the whale is shown with bright blue eyes and the cat could be interpreted as a younger, more feminine figure.  The two character are opposing but linked in the movie, unable to survive in each-others environment and seemingly drawn together, both traverse roughly the same journey.

[https://i.imgur.com/JjXSY6q.png](https://i.imgur.com/JjXSY6q.png)

The first stanza of Hard Rain evokes the geography of a surreal world. 

>I’ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains

In the rare shots where you see the entire ending mountain range there appear to be about 12 depending on how they are counted

[https://i.imgur.com/PO5imyS.png](https://i.imgur.com/PO5imyS.png)

>I’ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests

[https://i.imgur.com/CXE2zxk.png](https://i.imgur.com/CXE2zxk.png)

>I’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans  
I’ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

There is a shot of the cat looking across a graveyard of boats that have crashed on the rocks. [https://i.imgur.com/QSMyeI0.png](https://i.imgur.com/QSMyeI0.png)



The second stanza of the song paints a picture of a world in turmoil, where innocence and hope are threatened by violence and suffering.

>I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it

Cat is chased and surrounded by dogs in. the opening scene. [https://i.imgur.com/Kdyp2vS.png](https://i.imgur.com/Kdyp2vS.png)

>I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it

Could be related to the ""golden"" cities with no-one left in them. [https://i.imgur.com/X2jqG3c.png](https://i.imgur.com/X2jqG3c.png)

>I saw a white ladder all covered with water

Towards the end of the movie the bird and the cat ascend toward a blinding light as water droplets levitate with them. This could be interpreted as a stairway of ladder to heaven covered in water. [https://i.imgur.com/CbdSqGS.png](https://i.imgur.com/CbdSqGS.png)



More lyrics that allude to flooding and storms in the next stanza:

>I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin’  
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world

More imagery of flooding and heavy storms

>Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin’

Hunger is a common theme in the movie.

>Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter

I interpret this line as being self referential to Dylan himself. Again possibly related to the whale and its death.

>I met one man who was wounded in love  
I met another man who was wounded with hatred

Possibly referencing the birds. One gets it's wing broken buy protecting the cat.



The final stanza of the song is almost a call to action

>I’m a-goin’ back out ’fore the rain starts a-fallin’

The end of the movie hints at another impending flood.

>I’ll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest

>Where the people are many and their hands are all empty

[https://i.imgur.com/Jxq163q.png](https://i.imgur.com/Jxq163q.png)

I'll let more of Dylans beautiful words speak for themself.

>Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison

>Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten

>Where black is the color, where none is the number

>And I’ll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it

>And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it

>Then I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin’

>But I’ll know my song well before I start singin’

In conclusion I think flow is heavily influenced by Dylan and it seems likely that the movie draws from and directly references the song which may give additional insight into its meaning.  What that meaning is will likely be a bit different for everyone.",2,0,1741996438.0,2025-03-14 23:53:58,False
backtoblack,back to black,1j8amms,"March 7-9 Box Office Recap: 'Mickey 17' flops with an underwhelming $19 million domestically and a weak $53.3 worldwide total, against a $118 million budget. 'Ne Zha 2' crosses $2 billion in China.","https://preview.redd.it/aofa0t30pxne1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=367e3fc800286c66b0f76329f8703a94f53e9972

It was a very weak start for the month of March.

With incredibly weak competition, Bong Joon-ho's ***Mickey 17*** topped the box office, but it still proved to be the latest sci-fi flop at the box office. There were 3 other wide releases, all of which flopped as well. Needless to say, it was brutal.

The Top 10 earned a combined $49.2 million this weekend. That's an awful 62.4% drop from last year, when ***Kung Fu Panda 4*** topped the box office. This weekend is also barely up from last week, when there was just one wide release.

Opening at #1, WB's ***Mickey 17*** flopped with just $19 million in 3,807 theaters. These numbers are eerily similar to the box office failures of other sci-fi films like ***Jupiter Ascending*** ($18.3 million), ***Ad Astra*** ($19 million), and ***The Creator*** ($14 million). The only comfort is that it was Bong Joon-ho's biggest debut, but that's not saying much considering his prior films all opened in limited release. And it cost more than all his films ($118 million).

The failure of ***Mickey 17*** isn't surprising. There's a risk in opening a new sci-fi film, citing the failure of the previously mentioned titles. Even though ***Mickey 17*** is based on a book, it was treated as an original title anyway. So the film's disappointing numbers are another hit at the argument that audiences crave for new and original films.

Bong is popular with the cinephile audience; there was enormous interest in seeing what he would do after the colossal success of ***Parasite***. But it's been 5 years since that film won Best Picture, and it appears that the public moved on. This film was originally set for March 2024, but it faced many delays. WB reportedly spent $80 million in marketing the film, and while it properly sells the film, many were taken aback by the film's humor and tone. Even though this is consistent with Bong's films, perhaps the audience was expecting something more serious, as sci-fi comedies are very niche. 

This also brings up the topic of star power. Robert Pattinson is definitely popular, thanks to his roles in franchises like ***Harry Potter***, ***Twilight*** and ***The Batman***. But the thing is that his roles as leading man in non-IPs have not translated to box office success. Most of his films have been limited releases, and his last box office hit besides the three previously mentioned was ***Water for Elephants***, which came out back in 2011. This is not something exclusive to Pattinson, given that a lot of actors have struggled to open original titles. Reviews were positive (78% on RT), but not strong enough to convince those skeptical.

According to Warner Bros., 65% of the audience was male and 71% was 25 and over. They gave it a middling ""B"" on CinemaScore, which is neither bad nor great. There's a strong chance ***Mickey 17*** could be front-loaded, given that its Thursday previews ($2.5 million) should've guaranteed a $20+ million debut and it fell far short of it. For now, a $50 million domestic total is likely for ***Mickey 17***, marking the latest box office misfire for WB.

After topping the box office for three weekends, ***Captain America: Brave New World*** had to go to second place. It dropped 44%, adding $8.3 million this weekend. That's a fine drop, although it would've been ideal if it happened far sooner. Through almost one month, the film has earned $176.4 million, and it should get close to $200 million. Better than its second weekend suggested, but still not really a win.

In third place, Focus Features' ***Last Breath*** dropped 48%, adding $4 million this weekend. Through ten days, the film has amassed $14.5 million so far, and it should finish with over $20 million by the end of its run.

In fourth place, Neon's ***The Monkey*** eased 39% this weekend, adding $3.9 million this weekend. The film has earned $31 million domestically, and it has already passed ***I, Tonya*** ($30 million) to become Neon's third highest film ever.

***Paddington in Peru*** had its best drop yet. It eased just 18% this weekend, adding $3.7 million. The film has earned $36.8 million, and it should close with around $45 million domestically.

DreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** dipped a light 20%, earning $3.3 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $88.6 million so far, and it's fighting to hit the $100 million milestone.

After earning 5 Oscar wins, Best Picture winner ***Anora*** got expanded to 1,938 theaters. The film earned $1.8 million, taking its domestic total to $18.3 million. Quite impressive, considering it has been on digital platforms since December.

***Mufasa*** refuses to leave the Top 10. It eased just 16% this weekend, adding $1.6 million. With this, it has crossed $250 million domestically.

Angel Studios also opened ***Rule Breakers*** in 2,044 theaters, but it flopped with just $1.5 million. That's one of the worst debuts for a film playing at over 2,000 theaters, and translates to a very poor $736 per-theater average. Even with an ""A"" on CinemaScore, this film will disappear quickly from theaters.

Rounding up the Top 10 was another flop. It was Paul W.S. Anderson's new film, ***In the Lost Lands***, which debuted with a meager $1 million in 1,370 theaters. That's Anderson's worst debut ever, even below ***Monster Hunter*** ($2 million), which came out during terrible conditions in December 2020. Expect this to fade quickly.

What's worse than 3 wide releases flopping? 4 wide releases flopping. Viva Pictures released ***Night of the Zoopocalypse*** into 1,400 theaters, but it earned just $804,370 this weekend. Pathetic.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Mickey 17*** also made its appearance worldwide, but it was very unimpressive. The film debuted with $24.5 million overseas; adding its South Korean numbers from last week, the film has earned a weak $53.3 million worldwide. It had very soft debuts in France ($2.9M), the UK ($2.7M), Germany ($1.3M) and Mexico ($1.3M). Its biggest market, unsurprisingly, is South Korea with $14.6 million so far. With these numbers, it's clear ***Mickey 17*** won't be a box office success.

***Captain America: Brave New World*** has added $9.2 million overseas, taking its worldwide numbers to $371 million. The best markets are the UK ($21.2M), Mexico ($14.5M), China ($14.3M), France ($12.8M) and South Korea ($11.2M). The film might actually cross $400 million, although it's still far from breaking even.

***Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy*** added $7.3 million, allowing it to cross $103.8 million in the overseas markets. Its best marekts are the UK ($51.1M), Australia ($8.6M), Netherlands ($5M), Poland ($4.8M) and Germany ($4.1M). 

Back in China, ***Ne Zha 2*** made history by crossing $2 billion in the country. In the process, it already passed ***Avengers: Infinity War*** to become the sixth highest grossing film worldwide.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Conclave* | Oct/25 | Focus Features | $6,601,995 | $32,580,655 | $104,360,856 | $20M

- ***Conclave*** has ended its run with a fantastic $104 million worldwide. That's a great result for an adult drama, and a sign that there's an audience for films like this. Whether you like the film or not, it's great that a film like this could find an audience instead of being sent to straight-to-streaming.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We've got three wide releases this weekend, and there's a strong chance that there won't be a single film hitting $10 million this weekend.

The first is Paramount's action comedy ***Novocaine***, which stars Jack Quaid as a bank executive with the inability to feel pain who goes out to rescue his coworker after she is taken hostage by a group of bank robbers. The film has already screened for critics, and reviews are quite solid (89% on RT). A possible sleeper hit?

The other release is Steven Soderbergh's newest film, Focus Features' ***Black Bag***. It stars Cate Blanchett, Michael Fassbender, Marisa Abela, Tom Burke, Naomie Harris, Regé-Jean Page, and Pierce Brosnan, and follows an intelligence agent who suspect his wife might be a traitor. Soderbergh is coming off ***Presence***, which made just $9.2 million, becoming one of his lowest grossing titles. Focus has emphasized action and intrigue, and the reviews are currently on fire (91% on RT), so this should have no problem in opening far higher.

Finally, there's ***The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie***. In a twist of fate, WB is not handling this movie, deciding to sell it off instead. The distributor is Ketchup Entertainment, a recent company that hasn't had box office success in the past few years. And it's unlikely this movie changes that trajectory.

backtoblack,back to black,1j76p2h,"Sidney Poitier 1967 Trifecta: In the Heat of the Night, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, and To Sir With Love","This may not resonate with some of our younger readers for whom race relations has been explored in detail over the past 50 years or so.  But try to go back 50 years.  Until 1967 interracial marriage was illegal in some states until  Loving vs Virginia where the Supreme Court struck down a 1883 decision legalizing these laws.  Jackie Robinson became the first black major league baseball player just 20 years earlier.

So looking from that point of view. let's look at these three movies and his performances.  

In the Heat of the Night has true vistuoso performances by Poitier and Rod Steiger.  Steiger as the bigoted sheriff, Poitier as the black detective Virgil Tibbs.  A must see for pure raw emotion.   After thoroughly demolishing the Sheriff's railroading of someone in front of the widow of the murder victim and the very important owner of the town factory.  Like other ignorant bullies, he falls back on name-calling and demonizing the other.

Sheriff: ""Virgil, that's a funny name for a nigger boy that comes from Philadelphia.  What do they call you there"" 

Tibbs: ""They call me Mister Tibbs""

Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is a less emotional, more reasoned approach to race relations.  Also having Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn was great.

To Sir With Love, may be best remembered now for the theme song by Lulu looks at disenfranchised youths and racism.  Shows the power of respect, for ourselves and others.",48,5,1741523661.0,2025-03-09 12:34:21,False

**Rotten Tomatoes:** [94%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_bag)

**Metacritic:** [86/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/black-bag/)

Some Reviews:

[The Independent - Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/black-bag-review-steven-soderbergh-michael-fassbender-b2710141.html)

>While the supporting cast are impeccable across the board, it’s really Blanchett and Fassbender’s film to command, with performances that drip with old-school star power. Fassbender, when he delicately adjusts his glasses or cuffs, evokes the sly, chilled elegance of a Michael Caine or Dirk Bogarde, but with a sliver of vulnerability in the eyes that really begs the question of what exactly is going on in that head of his.

[Screen Daily - Tim Grierson](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/black-bag-review-fassbender-blanchett-spy-up-a-storm-for-steven-soderbergh/5202447.article)

>Highly entertaining from start to finish, the film benefits from David Koepp’s inventive screenplay and Soderbergh’s storytelling swagger.

[The Daily Beast - Nick Schager](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/black-bag-review-the-sleek-sexy-spy-thriller-movie-theaters-need/)

>When it comes to sleek, stylish genre movies, Soderbergh remains a maestro at the top of his game. A spy thriller that feels like a cross between John le Carré and Agatha Christie, the director’s latest—written, as was his prior [*Presence*](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/presence-review-steven-soderbergh-does-his-own-haunted-house-movie/), by Oscar-winning screenwriter David Koepp—is at once clipped and fluid, as sharp as a dagger and as silky as luxury bedsheets.

[The Wrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/black-bag-review-steven-soderbergh-michael-fassbender-cate-blanchett/)

>Human weakness is 'Black Bag’s' greatest strength. It’s an insidiously great spy movie, mature and satisfying. “Black Bag” digs into the superficially erogenous spy genre and finds inside it a desperate need for therapy. It’s an intricately intertwined tale of sexual strife and political machinations, and a strong reminder at the heart of every drama, personal or political, there’s human weakness.

[TIME - Stephanie Zacharek](https://time.com/7264825/black-bag-review-steven-soderbergh/)

>Black Bag succeeds on its chilly wit, and on the cool, nervy appeal of its two stars. Blanchett strides through the movie with lioness grace; Fassbender makes George’s robotic use of logic seem like an aphrodisiac.

[IGN - Siddhant Adlakha ](https://www.ign.com/articles/black-bag-review-michael-fassbender-cate-blanchett-steven-soderbergh)

>Its story of three couples working at the same British agency turns all the right screws with impeccable timing, forcing its characters to examine the flaws in their relationships as its tale of state secrets gradually unravels. A film that projects domestic anxieties onto the espionage genre, Steven Soderbergh’s Black Bag is a slick, self-assured, wildly entertaining spy thriller about a husband-wife intelligence duo forced to question their trust.

[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/black-bag-review-steven-soderbergh-cate-blanchett-michael-fassbender-1236329004/)

>Steven Soderbergh dashes off a sleek little genre exercise -- a doodle really, at a stage in his career when he’s clearly just having fun -- that proves to be one of his smartest and sexiest films yet.

[Deadline - Pete Hammond](https://deadline.com/2025/03/black-bag-review-michael-fassbender-cate-blanchett-spies-steven-soderberghs-stylish-thriller-1236311971/)

>With an A+ cast at the top of their game, a tight 93 minute running time, and dialogue with wit and bite, this finds the director with one of his best opportunities to do what he does so well and give that older audience a reason to go back to the movies.

[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/07/black-bag-review-michael-fassbender-and-cate-blanchett-intrigue-in-marital-espionage)

>Steven Soderbergh’s downbeat, affectless tongue-in-cheek spy comedy (“caper” isn’t quite right) is in this new mode, though taking itself to the edge of self-satire, with a few 007 refugees in the cast, efficiently scripted by David Koepp.",167,65,1741275417.0,2025-03-06 15:36:57,False
backtoblack,back to black,1j42ve1,"I have a question about the ending of Pitch Black (spoilers inside, obviously)","I have a soft spot for this movie. It's not like it's groundbreaking but it is interesting enough, and Riddick was a rather fascinating anti-hero character. Spoilers if you keep reading on, of course, but if you have already seen Pitch Black, then by all means continue and let me know what you think.

Here was my interpretation of Fry's death this whole time:

Riddick initially was going to leave them all behind. Then Fry shows up and he tries to convince her to leave with him, because Riddick has a very 'survival of the fittest' attitude. Fry almost relents, but ultimately fights back against Riddick and convinces him to help her go rescue the others. Only after Fry says she'd die for them.

Things go a bit south for Riddick and he's stuck nearly dead, and then Fry goes back to save him. She even says ""I'd die for them, but not for you."" However, then Fry is stabbed. Now, *my* assumption was that a Bioraptor got her, and you can see the disappointment in Riddick's face.

He's not happy about this, since he did have some measure of respect for Fry. She did have aspects of Riddick's survival instincts, but then proved she was even more than that, which probably kinda shook Riddick's worldview. And then after all that, she dies anyway. Which is why he even says ""not for me"" after she gets carried off. She wouldn't die for him, but she ended up dying anyway.

But I heard someone say that *Riddick* stabbed her. And at first I'm like, no way, were you even watching?? But I went back and watched the scene and...it's unclear. You don't actually see her wound. You don't see a Bioraptor, but you also don't see Riddick's shiv.

However, he DID have it in his hand...and it was also primed to stab her in the lumbar just like he did with the Mercenary (Johns? Was that his name? It's been a while since I've watched the whole thing.)

So his interpretation was that Riddick stabbed her to use her as bait to escape, and I guess then he was just kinda sad that it was necessary? Or killed her because she wouldn't have died for him, or something?

This isn't nearly as narratively satisfying to me, however I have to admit that the way the scene was shot, it *could* be what happened. Like, it just seems out of character that Riddick would do that to Fry since she'd earned his respect and she was already between him and the Bioraptor that flew off with her, so it just doesn't seem necessary to me.

backtoblack,back to black,1isqhrs,"February 14-17 Box Office Recap: 'Captain America: Brave New World' opens with almost $200 million worldwide, but poor word of mouth (""B–"" on CinemaScore) suggests it will fall off quickly. Meanwhile, 'Ne Zha 2' passes 'Inside Out 2' to become the biggest animated film ever.","https://preview.redd.it/w0x4cvb8ezje1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa747c18c7aa51c3a31e2c98d37ffd334591251b

Well, it could've been worse.

Unsurprisingly, ***Captain America: Brave New World*** easily topped the box office with almost $200 million worldwide, even though its long-term prospects aren't looking good. ***Paddington in Peru*** also made its debut in the States, delivering a very solid debut.

The Chinese film ***Ne Zha 2*** also debuted in the States, delivering the best numbers for a Chinese film in 20 years. But the bigger story was in its home country; with $1.7 billion in the bank, the film has officially passed ***Inside Out 2*** to become the biggest animated film worldwide.

The Top 10 earned a combined $165.4 million this weekend. That's up a colossal 100% from last year, when ***Bob Marley: One Love*** got high, and ***Madame Web*** hit rock bottom.

Debuting at #1, ***Captain America: Brave New World*** earned $89.8 million ($101 million four-day) in 4,105 theaters. Those numbers are obviously below ***Civil War*** ($179.1 million), but they're also below ***Winter Soldier*** ($95 million) despite 11 years of inflation. They're also below ***Quantumania*** ($106.1 million), which also opened on this date two years ago.

Generally speaking, this is an okay (but not great) debut. Having Anthony Mackie take the mantle of Captain America was always going to be tricky, so a decrease from the past two films was expected. And hey, it worked; if the audience wasn't interested, the film wouldn't have opened to over $80 million. 

To boost the film, Marvel decided to add Red Hulk to the mix and casting Harrison Ford (replacing the late William Hurt). The whole marketing relied on selling both Sam Wilson and Red Hulk; even before a first trailer came out, McDonald's already spoiled Red Hulk's appearance in their menus back in March 2024. Despite that incident, it built awareness for the film, and got people to give the film a chance.

According to Disney, 62% of the audience was male, and 49% was in the 18-34 demographic. Ford's presence clearly had an impact; 42% of the audience was 35 and over. It made this debut, despite scoring a very weak 50% on RT. It speaks volumes to Marvel's power that a film with mediocre response can open this high, but perhaps it's not a sign for its long-term prospects.

So why is this debut not considered great? Basically, it all comes down to the reception. Critics aren't fond of the film, but the audience even less so. Audiences gave ***Brave New World*** a poor ""B–"" on CinemaScore. That's not only the worst grade for an MCU film (even ***The Marvels*** and ***Quantumania*** got a ""B""), but it's also below any DCEU film. That points to very poor word of mouth. Not surprising, considering the film relies on how much the average moviegoer remembers ***The Falcon and the Winter Soldier*** (if they ever watched it in the first place), and the fact that its centerpiece (Red Hulk) is far less than the marketing suggests.

So what's it gonna happen now? The one advantage is that competition is quite weak for the rest of the month, but the MCU has proven to be front-loaded. ***Black Panther: Wakanda Forever*** topped the box office for 5 weeks, had strong word of mouth and very weak competition, and it still finished with just a 2.50x multiplier. A proper comp should be ***Quantumania***, given that it had similar reception and opened on the same date. That had poor legs (2.02x multiplier), which would give ***Brave New World*** a $181 million domestic run. We'll see with that second weekend drop.

***Paddington in Peru*** debuted with $12.7 million this weekend ($16 million four-day). That's still below the original's $18.9 million debut, but above the second film's $11 million.

It's hard to ask for better numbers here. The ***Paddington*** franchise has always been an international-heavy one (this film has already made $100 million overseas). Just look at the pattern; America represented just 30.5% of the first film's global run, and the second just 17.0%. Not to mention that this franchise is now 10 years old. So by this point, either you're in or just don't care.

According to Sony, 52% of the audience was male and despite being marketed towards families, 32% of the audience was 25-34 (its biggest demo). They gave it a strong ""A"" on CinemaScore, which is the same grade as the previous films. With an empty corridor for family films, this should hold well. For now, a $50 million domestic total is likely for ***Paddington in Peru***.

Boosted by its holiday and theme, ***Heart Eyes*** increased 19%, adding $9.8 million ($10.7 million four-day). That's one of the best holds for a wide release, but as mentioned, the holiday surely helped. The film has earned $22.4 million so far, and it should hit $30 million, even though its third weekend might see a larger-than-expected drop.

In fourth place, ***Dog Man*** eased 29% for a $9.7 million weekend ($13.3 million four-day). That's a recovery from its steep drop last week, although the holiday clearly boosted the weekend. For example, its Saturday was off a rough 49% from past Saturday. The film has amassed $70.4 million, but it's still up in the air if it will hit $100 million.

***Ne Zha 2*** debuted in 660 theaters, where it over-performed projections with $7.2 million ($8.3 million four-day). This is the biggest debut for a Chinese film in North America since ***Hero*** ($17 million) back in 2004. Depending on how long it stays in wide release, it could have a healthy long run. But needless to say, it's not like it needs America to be a success anyway.

***Mufasa*** continues showing legs. The film increased 6%, grossing $2.4 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $240.8 million.

In seventh place, ***Love Hurts*** was helped by Valentine's Day. It eased 28%, adding $4.1 million this weekend ($4.7 million four-day). The film has earned a meager $12.1 million, and with the holiday over, it's set to drop like a rock.

Sony's ***One of Them Days*** also increased this weekend. It jumped 4%, adding $2.9 million this weekend ($3.3 million four-day). The film has amassed $43.9 million, and it's gonna finish with close to $50 domestically, which is damn great for an R-rated comedy.

***Companion*** is nearing the end of its run. After its second weekend drop, the film lost 2,223 theaters this weekend. Nevertheless, it still dipped 39%, adding $1.8 million this weekend ($2 million four-day). The film has earned $19 million domestically, and with the holiday over, it's set for another heavy drop next weekend.

Rounding up the Top 10 was the Indian film ***Chhaava***, which made $1.7 million ($2.1 million four-day) in 497 theaters.

Sony expanded ***Becoming Led Zeppelin*** into 1,039 theaters, although its wide release wasn't as strong as its exclusive IMAX run. It dipped 32%, adding $1.7 million this weekend.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Captain America: Brave New World*** was also the biggest film overseas. It debuted with $92.4 million, for a $193.4 million worldwide debut, although the overseas number is below the forecasts. The biggest debuts were in China ($10.5M), UK ($8.5M), Mexico ($6.6M), Korea ($5.6M) and France ($4.7M). Right now, all eyes are on the second weekend, for it will determine if the film can break even.

Well, ***Ne Zha 2*** has made history. With $1.68 billion worldwide (basically just China), the film has passed ***Inside Out 2*** to become the highest animated film ever. You know what's crazier? Maoyan is projecting the film to end with $2.16 billion in China, which, if it gets there, would make it the No. 5 movie ever globally. Fascinating.

***Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy*** also made its global debut (unless you live in North America, where it was dumped on Peacock). The film debuted with $35.5 million in 70 markets, which is the biggest in the franchise. In the UK, it debuted with $14.2 million, which is a record for a rom-com. Other strong debuts were in Australia ($3.4M), Poland ($2.2M), Netherlands ($1.9M), and Spain ($1M). It will continue adding a few more markets, but you can take for certain that this is gonna be another profitable entry in the franchise.

***Paddington in Peru*** added $7.3 million this weekend, and its worldwide total is now $131.8 million. The film still has Korea, Italy, Spain and Japan left. 

Two Oscar contenders are hitting milestones. Both ***A Complete Unknown*** and ***Conclave*** have officially hit $100 million worldwide.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Kraven the Hunter* | Dec/13 | Sony | $11,001,109 | $25,026,310 | $61,987,172 | $110M

- ***Kraven the Hunter*** has ended its run with a pathetic $61.9 million worldwide, far below its $110 million budget. Despite some promise that J.C. Chandor's presence could elevate the film, the film actually had the worst word-of-mouth of any of Sony's desperate attempts to build a Spider-Man universe, that somehow lacks Spider-Man himself. Even with the holidays, it crashed and died very quickly. RIP Spider-Manless Spider-Man Universe. You won't be missed. 

#**THIS WEEKEND**

Even with ***Brave New World*** heading towards a steep drop, it doesn't have much competition for the top spot barring a last-minute surge.

The biggest release is Neon's new horror film ***The Monkey***, the latest film from Osgood Perkins. Perkins struck gold with ***Longlegs*** back in the summer, and Neon is mounting a very efficient marketing campaign. With some weak titles so far, perhaps this could be the year's first breakout horror.

There's another smaller release, and that is ***The Unbreakable Boy***, which stars... Zachary Levi. Considering he's coming off a huge losing streak, it's unlikely this can change things up.

backtoblack,back to black,1is76rk,Prior CMC Pictures experience?,"Hello! Question, has anyone ever heard of or had prior experience with CMC Pictures? They seem to be a smaller distribution company for Chinese movies in the USA/Canada region. They recently got ahold of Nezha 2. I am worried about missing the movie in theaters since I think I am becoming sick and don't want to accidentally spread anything to anyone, even with a mask on, in theaters.         
 I was hoping to be able to get Nezha 2 on home media, however I can't seem to find any listing of movie home releases by CMC Pictures. Why and how on earth this tiny studio that isn't capable of meeting anime/donghua fans' common wish of having home media, due to often limited theater runs and small advertising in North America, and general collector bragging rights, managed to get ahold of the distribution rights for such a giant IP like Nezha, when the previous distributors Well Go and Gkids were able to handle the theater and home media distribution together, I'll never know. I also sadly missed the donghua 30,000 miles from Chang'an, which was distributed in the north American region by a tiny company called Niu Visions Company. No home media, only one week in theaters, not even on any north American streaming, it's like lost media for the English subtitles! I am worried Nezha 2 will also become lost media for north Americans once the theater run is over.           
Sorry if this has typos, I'm posting from my phone. I'm just frustrated by my bad luck. I saw Nezha 1 in theaters and thankfully have a blu ray copy. I've been waiting about 5 years for this movie, only for a friend to get sick recently after we hung out this past weekend.       
Here is the CMC Pictures company website link, seriously has anyone ever heard of any of these? Why not just let the bigger and more experienced foreign film/animation licensing company take this, like Gkids or Criterion? Also, sorry if foreign films/ non English language movies arent normally brought up here, but when i tried to find information or previous posts of CMC pictures, searches seem to think im talking about some CNC machines for wood burning or laser engraving/cutting? :     https://cmc-pictures.com/         
                                      
Also, for any new donghua fans who are interested in Nezha from watching Nezha 2 or seeing headlines about the box office success it had recently: so, Nezha and other characters come from a classic Chinese literature called the Investiture of the God's, also known as the Fengshan Yanyi. It's about the Goddess Nuwa getting disrespected by an arrogant human King, so she basically sends in a honeypot spy trap who seduces the king and causes a giant civil war. To bring back peace, many talented people and cultivators and mythical beings came together to fight the evil corrupt King and calm Nuwa. At the end, they all get named after constellations and put in the history books as Chinese folk heroes. If you are into anime/donghua and video games, I'm sure you've seen these stock characters like Nezha, Sun Wukong, Jiang Ziya, Nuwa, etc., before. Like the Fate series, literally Black Myth Sun Wukong the souls like game, GranBlue Fantasy, etc., they are everywhere in East Asian media basically.           
 There are two English translations of this book, but both suck for different reasons. One is an abridged version that is incomplete, like only 20 chapters are translated. I think it's in Amazon Kindle or something,  but seriously don't waste your money on an incomplete book! The other has all 100 chapters  completely translated, but due to low demand for classic Chinese literature, it is like a $200 each textbook for all 4 books of the series. I was able to read a bit of it thanks for my college having a library program, but it's stupidly expensive and obscure, it's really hard for the average non Chinese speakers/readers to get ahold of this book. It's also just quite dry and boring. I'm not sure if it's just the English translation quality, if it's more interesting prose in Chinese, or if this kind of dry writing is just common in classic Chinese literature.                                 
So, if you have American Netflix, I'm sure you've noticed that there are two Nezhas listed.                  
The Nezha 2 in the headlines right now is the sequel to Nezha 2019, which is an origin story for THE Nezha in ancient times. There is also Jiang Ziya, who is now a depressed war vetern after the war in the Investiture. These are directed by Jiaozi and by Chengdu Coco Cartoon/Beijing Enlight Media. Like the Avengers, this cinematic universe wants to reimagine these stock folk heroes what ifs? before having them team up. Either their origin story before the Investiture of the Gods war, or like a continuation of their stories after the war. So far, we have Nezha (and Ao Bing, originally a minor villain who gets killed off easily in the novel iirc, now Nezha's best friend) and Jiang Ziya. Nezha here is an immature little kid, but he has a god/teenager form when the collar on his neck is removed. It is also set in ancient times. Nezha and Jiang Ziya are both available on blu ray via GKIDS home distribution. They also had theater runs via Well Go USA distribution company. 
           
The second Nezha is part of the New Gods cinematic universe, by Light chaser animation studio. This Nezha is a mortal, not a God, but he regains his God powers through the movie. He's reincarnated. It takes place in a more modern steampunk like China. The Godly powers and fights in the New Gods cinematic universe are more like Jojo Bizarre Adventures stand fights tbh. They also have New Gods Yang Jian, who is also a depressed war vet like Jiang Ziya. If you know the story of the Lotus Lamp, this is a reimagined version of the protagonists' uncle who sealed the protag's mother under the mountain. Yang Jian takes place in ancient times, but the epilogue shows him as an immortal God in the modern steampunk time about to team up with Sun Wukong and reincarnated Nezha. This studio also did White Snake, Green Snake, and 30,000 miles from Chang'an. I've seen all the Light chaser movies but Chang'an (thanks Niu Visions!). I don't think that white and green snake are part of the new gods cinematic universe, but I could be wrong as the New Gods cinematic universe expands in the future.  New Gods Nezha and Green Snake are in netflix jail, no home media iirc. I saw Yang Jian in theaters and have it on blu ray. White Snake is also on blu ray. Chang an is just lost media at this point sadly (for English speakers).         
              
So two different cinematic universes and animation studios!           
Nezha 2019 - kid Nezha, historic fantasy, Jiang Ziya and Ao Bing are there too, has some childish humor, all ages type movie. Jiang Ziya was like no humor though, just a sad old man like John Wick with cool fight scenes but an overall slow paced movie, still confused on the demographic of that one tbh. I doubt the families with little kids that liked Nezha 2019 would have patience for Jiang Ziya's somber and slow story. I still enjoyed it but it really was quite dry.   
New Gods Nezha - teen/young adult reincarnated Nezha, modern/urban fantasy steampunk, JJBA stand fights, the monkey king is there too, and sometime later Yang Jiang will also team up with them I guess? Less humorous, more for teens and adults I think? I think the Snake movies were also more for teens and adults,  not much humor or light hearted-ness, if that makes sense
Sorry if this is off topic a bit, but I hope this helps anyone new to donghua/the two Investiture of the god animated cinematic universes thanks to Nezha 2.",0,1,1739863541.0,2025-02-18 07:25:41,False
backtoblack,back to black,1io5une,How would Michel Gondry's Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) work if he was offered the job and had the chance to do so,"I know that Gondry is know to be hard to work with major studios and that he mostly does non-IP films but despite the first Avengers being a good movie, I consider Age of Ultron to be a underwhelming sequel. But since Michel Gondry's Golden got cancelled at Universal, this made me think if he had the opportunity to do Age of Ultron, this is what he would do if he directed and wrote the movie instead of Joss Whedon:

Well, first thing he would do is that it would be stylized and shot like a music video like his music videos he shot. Gondry would probably use techniques of a music video in this movie since he did music videos back in the day

Then second thing is that he would make Ultron creepier and scarier and have his design looks like a deformed robot with a voice sounding like a evil robot and potentially make him like a evil Godzilla. Plus, he would remove the Black Widow/Hulk romance thing and instead focusing more on the team's differences.

Then the third thing is that he would have its score be consisted of techno music, composed by a techno group by someone like Daft Punk and the sounds of people fighting would have been accompanied by techno punches and sounds. That's what he would do if he had control of the score and asked someone to compose the movie.

Then lastly, he would make his Age of Ultron a darker tone than the first Avengers movie and wouldn't have jokes and comedic lines, instead focusing on its darker aspects such as scariness and violence.

I doubt that Marvel would let Gondry do those things if he actually directed the thing. But if he did, How would people reacted to his Age of Ultron: Would they like it or not? Let us know in the comments section.",0,9,1739405028.0,2025-02-13 00:03:48,False

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/02/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-marvel-reboot-1236286418/):

>Director Julius Onah (*Luce)* and a boatload of writers provide plenty of oppotunity for Mackie to show his strengths although Evans’ Steve Rogers is a tough act to follow. That fact is even alluded to at one point, but watching Mackie taking Sam Wilson into the big leagues is a game effort with room to grow.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-1236303617/) (70):

>Wilson’s Captain America lacks the serum-enhanced invincibility that defined Rogers. He’s a hand-to-hand combat badass, but far more dependent on his shield and wingsuit, both of which are made of vibranium. You could say that that makes him a hero more comparable to, say, Iron Man (though Tony Stark’s principal weapon was Robert Downey Jr.’s motormouth), and Wilson’s all-too-mortal quality comes through in the sly doggedness of Mackie’s when-you’re-number-two-you-try-harder performance. But on a gut level we’re thinking, “Wasn’t the earlier Captain America more…super?”

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-marvel-1236133439/) (40):

>At 118 minutes, *Captain America: Brave New World* thankfully runs on the short side for a Marvel movie, but under the uninspired direction of Julius Onah (*Luce*, *The Cloverfield Paradox*) it feels much longer. Even the CGI special effects prove underwhelming, and sometimes worse than that. It is a kick, though, to recognize Ford’s facial features in the Red Hulk, even if the character is only slightly more visually convincing than his de-aged Indiana Jones in that franchise’s final installment.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/captain-america-brave-new-world-review/) (30):

>“Captain America: Brave New World” was directed by Julius Onah (“Luce”), but like lots of Marvel movies lately, it plays like it was made by a focus group. Everything looks clean, so clean it looks completely fake, and every time a daring choice could be made, the movie backs away from the daring implications. This is a film where the President of the United States literally turns red and tries to publicly murder a Black man, and yet according to “Brave New World,” the real problem is that we weren’t sympathetic enough to the dangerously corrupt rage monster. This film’s steadfast refusal to engage with its own ideas, either by artistic design or corporate mandate, reeks of timidity.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/captain-america-brave-new-world-movie-review-1235094677/) (C-):

>It’s fitting enough that “Brave New World” is a film about (and malformed by) the pressures of restoring a diminished brand. It’s even more fitting that it’s also a film about the futility of trying to embody an ideal that the world has outgrown. Sam Wilson might find a way to step out of Steve Rogers’ shadow, but there’s still no indication that the MCU ever will.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-red-hulk) (5/10):

>Captain America: Brave New World feels neither brave, nor all that new, falling short of strong performances from Anthony Mackie, Harrison Ford, and Carl Lumbly.

[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/marvel-movies/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-mcu-marvel/) (3/5):

>Anthony Mackie's Captain America earns his Stars and Stripes in this uneven, un-MCU thriller. Sam Wilson and an always-excellent Harrison Ford drag Brave New World into unfamiliar narrative territory before it eventually succumbs to familiar Marvel failings

[Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-mcu-anthony-mackie-1235251815/) (40):

>While *Brave New World* is nowhere near as bad as the various MCU low points of the past few years, this attempt at both reestablishing the iconic character and resetting the board is still weak tea. The end credits’ teaser — you knew there would be one — feels purposefully generic and vague, as if the powers that be became gun-shy in regards to committing to a storyline that might [once again be forced to pivot](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/jonathan-majors-kang-marvel-fired-mcu-future-domestic-violence-loki-avengers-1234931990/). Something’s coming, we’re told. Please let it be a renewal of faith in this endlessly serialized experiment.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world/) (3/5):

>Pacy and punchy, this is a promising first official outing for the new Captain America, even if some awkward and inconsistent moments hold it back from greatness.

[Collider](https://collider.com/captain-america-brave-new-world-review/) (4/10):

>In trying to do so much all at once, *Captain America: Brave New World* forgets what made its title character a relatable fan-favorite. Instead, we get a narrative that is as convoluted as it is boring, visuals that are as unappealing as they are uninspired, and a Marvel movie that is as frustrating as it is forgettable. Had this been a random C-list Marvel hero, that would be forgivable, but for a character as revered as Captain America, it's a huge disappointment.

backtoblack,back to black,1ine19p,How would The Lord of the Rings films be if they had stuck to Miramax's vision?,"So basically, back in 1997 after Peter Jackson's original version of King Kong got cancelled, Jackson moved onto Lord of the Rings when it was already set up at Miramax. It was basically envisioned as this: one Hobbit film, then two Lord of the Rings films under Miramax but UA actually owned the film rights to The Hobbit so they basically just decided to do two Lord of the Rings films and do The Hobbit down the road as a prequel.

Well, Peter Jackson tried to talk Miramax into doing three films but there were intent on only doing two Lord of the Rings films, the first film covering Fellowship of the Ring and Two Towers and the second film covering Return of the King. And Jackson agreed to it for a while. Then somehow during pre-production, Disney CEO Michael Eisner looked at the budget which was $75M a piece for these two films. So basically, after that: Miramax wanted to tell the whole story all in one film. Here's what changes that Jackson made for Miramax's version.

>Between the synopsis and the treatment, Jackson decided to cut Gildor, Crickhollow, the Old Forest, Tom Bombadil, the Barrow-wight, Bill Ferney, Radagast, Lothlorien and Ghan-Buri-Ghan. The final treatment divides the story into two parts: The Fellowship of the Ring (which covered the novel of that name, and The Two Towers) and The War of the Ring. The first opens immediately with the Battle of the Last Alliance (in what Jackson called a ""James Bond"" opening) and ends with Saruman's death, and Gandalf and Pippin (the latter having looked into the Palantir) going to Minas Tirith

>In this treatment, Farmer Maggot and Glorfindel are present; Gwaihir and Gandalf visit Edoras after escaping Saruman, and Eowyn and Eomer help him find Shadowfax against the wishes of a possessed Theoden. Gollum attacks Frodo when the Fellowship is still united, a struggle during which the Ring falls into the mud and is picked up by Boromir. Bilbo attends the Council of Elrond and Sam looks into Galadriel's mirror. At the end of the film, Saruman is shot by an overhead Nazgûl and, before his death, is redeemed through issuing the Palantir for Gandalf to look into. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are sent south to espy Sauron's forces, and Frodo and Sam are en route to the Black Gate.

>The second film opens in the thick of battle, and ends with Frodo sailing to the West. It features a more pronounced romantic triangle with Arwen and Eowyn, including a scene of Aragorn and Eowyn ""asleep in each other's arms""; and has Elladan, Elrohir and Erkenbrand join Aragorn on the Paths of the Dead (the latter dying in the process), which are described as though made of flesh. The Nazgul just make it into Mount Doom before they fall.

>In this version, Farmer Maggot and Fatty Bolger appear. Gandalf is more frail and has given up pipe-smoking, and Gimli's dialogue contains several vulgarities. Sam, Merry and Pippin are all caught eavesdropping behind the door and forced to go along with Frodo. The Nazgul skewer Barliman Butterbur and Wargs attack the Hobbits near Weathertop. Gandalf's account of his time at Orthanc was pulled out of flashback and Lothlórien was cut, with Galadriel doing what she does in the story at Rivendell. Denethor attends the Council of Elrond with his son. The Watcher in the Water, absent from the treatment, is reinstated. Arwen now rescues Frodo instead of Glorfindel, and later joins the battle of Helm's Deep, where a Nazgul sweeps in, only for its fell beast slain by Gimli. Indeed, Theoden's palace is placed in Helm's Deep itself. While on the Seat of Seeing, Frodo sees the Nazgul, having killed Saruman, attack Gandalf. He puts on the Ring to draw him away and is attacked by a fell-beast, which Sam lassos to the structure. The Nazgul attacks Sam before Frodo kills it.

>The second script included a sex scene between Aragorn and Arwen in the Glittering Pools, interrupted by Legolas and Gimli's sight-seeing the caves. Arwen later fends off a Nazgul that menaces Pippin and joins the Rohirrim. The writers considered having Arwen absorb Éowyn's role entirely by having her kill the Witch-king, with the resulting wound becoming the source of her illness. Faramir finds Frodo after Denethor sends him to do so, having learned the secret of the quest from Pippin. Imrahil and Forlong appear in the script, and Aragorn fights Sauron in front of the Black Gates

>Bob Weinstein commissioned Jack Lechner to sketch a one-film version of the story. Lechner saw the story as too ""dense"" and that any two-film version would have left audiences unfulfilled since the story was only ""half-told"". He thought Frodo was a weak character. On 17 June 1998, he sent a memo in which he suggested cutting Bree and the Battle of Helm's Deep, ""losing or using"" Saruman, merging Rohan and Gondor, and making Éowyn Boromir's sister, shortening Rivendell and Moria (losing the Balrog and the fight in Balin's Tomb in the process) as well as having Ents prevent the Uruk-hai from kidnapping Merry and Pippin.

Even Peter Jackson admitted that cutting out half of the good stuff was not a good idea at all despite Miramax trying to force him to do at first, one four-hour film, then one two-hour film. In fact, Harvey Weinstein told Peter Jackson that Weinstein wanted Quentin Tarantino to direct it but the idea was shut down. Eventually, Miramax let Peter Jackson shop around the film but limiting the turnaround window to four weeks so that they could force Peter Jackson to do the one-film version. Before the four-week period was over, Jackson found a buyer with New Line to distribute, finance and produce these movies and not only that, Bob Shaye convinced Peter Jackson to do three Lord of the Rings movies, not two of them and the rest is history.

backtoblack,back to black,1ijwqji,The Karate Kid (1984-1989) series: Was anyone surprised to realize Daniel LaRusso was not a likable hero?,"What stuck out to me was that Daniel was far from being a conventional hero, he's surprisingly flawed and hard to root for sometimes. 

I have a hard time seeing Daniel's arc of a victim who fights back because a lot of the problems he had were caused by him meddling in other people's private matters. Him trying to butt in Johnny and Ali's fight at the beach, him doing a prank on the Cobra Kai while they were drugged out of their mind, him going to the Cobra Kai dojo bent on revenge and being dumb enough to be caught by them. 

Does it mean he deserved to be beaten black and blue or thrown off a cliff? No, but none of that was unprovoked. I mean, bullying is usually unprovoked and comes from jocks who want to torture someone out of sadistic glee. That didn't happen. Johnny left Daniel alone when  Daniel kept his distance. 

Daniel's other problems is that he's lazy, he drops out of college so he could live with an Elderly Japanese man, he is naive to the point of stupidity like when he got convinced by Terry Silver to go through a training process. Like, did Daniel really believe punching a wood wall was going to turn him into the 2nd coming of Bruce Lee? Not to mention, Part III and he was still acting like the scaredy cat of the first movie when Mike Barnes would harass him. Also, his personality sucks, having temper tantrums because Miyagi wouldn't teach him new moves. Dude, you're lucky Miyagi didn't throw your ass out on the street. Never once did we see him sell any Bonsais, just eating and sleeping. 

The fact that all of his romantic interests dumped him didn't put him in a good light either: Ali crashed his car and went off with another jock, Kumiko lied about a singing career in Osaka so she'd have an excuse to dump Daniel (and he believed it) and Jessica had an imaginary boyfriend.

Well, the first two movies anyway, and I liked Resurrection and AVP1 also... but i HATED all the other movies, especially Prometheus and Covenant   

So I wasn't sure what to expect with Romulus. 

I spent like 85% of the movie thinking it was pretty solid, probably the 3rd or 4th best Alien movie, despite feeling a little slow 

And then, I got to *that* bit... where Fredi Alvarez thought it would be good to shoehorn that hideously ugly 'thing' as a way to continue all that Prometheus / Covenant garbage. 

Nice way to fucking ruin an otherwise enjoyable film. Please keep all that philosophical bullshit out of the franchise and just keep things simple / mysterious like it used to be!

On a more positive note, the Xenomorph looked incredible, especially with the practical effects. 

If there's one thing that truly stood out for me though, it was the audio of the pulse rifle towards the end, I gotta say it sounded beautiful. It brought back so many memories of being obsessed with Aliens (1986) when I was younger, only more modern and beefed up... it actually made me feel a little emotional as ridiculous as that sounds lol

* Michael Biehn: The Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss - then mostly direct-to-video after the early 90s

backtoblack,back to black,1ibm00p,"January 24-26 Box Office Recap: In a very quiet weekend, 'Flight Risk' tops the box office, but poor reviews and word of mouth will prevent it from holding well. 'Presence' has an okay start in 1,750 theaters, while 'Brave the Dark' flops outside the Top 10.","https://preview.redd.it/hjr42iwe3mfe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bea2ede539c39f9000b3f9661915c8e54fee033

In one of the quietest weekends (it's January after all), ***Flight Risk*** seized the opportunity to top the box office. The weekend's other new release was Neon's ***Presence***, which had a soft start in less than 2,000 theaters. But the real loser was Angel Studios' ***Brave the Dark***, which flopped with one of the worst debuts in 2,000 theaters.

The Top 10 earned a combined $54.2 million this weekend. That's up 30.1% from last year, when ***Mean Girls*** repeated on the top spot for a third week.

Debuting in 3,161 theaters, Lionsgate's ***Flight Risk*** earned $11.5 million this weekend. That's star Mark Wahlberg's biggest debut since ***Uncharted*** ($44 million), and his biggest for a non-IP since ***Instant Family*** ($18 million). Although for director Mel Gibson, this is his lowest debut as director since ***Man Without a Face*** ($4 million) back in 1993.

This is an okay, not great start. The production kept the budget low at $25 million and it clearly shows, given the film is mostly set in a plane with only three characters. And perhaps that's why the film didn't make a huge landing here; it simply lacks an interesting hook. The plot gave streaming vibes and the film's tone (the tagline is ""Y'all need a pilot?"") suggested it this was going to be a non-event. It's simply a film that people saw a few times already.

There's also a problem regarding star power. Wahlberg is clearly well known, but his name has taken a dive in the past years. Most of his films in the past years have flopped, with ***Uncharted*** becoming the rare box office hit (and that's because of the IP). Michelle Dockery (who also starred in another plane thriller, ***Non-Stop***, back in 2014) and Topher Grace aren't big names that draw people to theaters either. And Lionsgate decided to avoid showcasing Gibson's involvement from marketing, choosing to use ""from the director of ***Braveheart***, ***Apocalypto*** and ***Hacksaw Ridge***"" as its selling point. While Gibson is often considered a great filmmaker, this was a miss: it's sitting at an awful 25% on RT.

According to Lionsgate, 54% of the audience was male and 55% was 25 and over. Critics hated the film and audiences agreed; they gave it an awful ""C"" on CinemaScore, which is simply terrible for an action thriller. With other thriller/action films like ***Companion*** and ***Love Hurts*** coming up, this film is heading for a freefall. For now, a $25 million domestic total is likely, which will make it Gibson's least attended film as director.

***Mufasa*** dipped 29%, adding $8.5 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $220.9 million, and it should get close to $250 million by the end of its run.

Sony's ***One of Them Days*** eased just 32%, adding $8 million this weekend. That's a very great hold for a comedy, indicating word of mouth is strong with this one. Through ten days, the film has earned $25.1 million domestically, and it should finish with over $40 million.

In fourth place, ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** eased 38%, adding $5.3 million. That takes its domestic total to $225.9 million.

***Moana 2*** eased just 30%, adding $4.1 million this weekend. The film has amassed $449.9 million so far.

In sixth place, Neon's ***Presence*** debuted with $3.3 million in 1,750 theaters. That's Steven Soderbergh's worst debut in wide release, below ***Unsane*** ($3.7 million). But this result is not surprising. At least it was above Neon's recent horror ***Cuckoo*** ($3 million).

Soderbergh has pivoted from theatrical releases, with ***Magic Mike's Last Dance*** making his first theatrical film since 2018. In those years, he has gone on to release films for Netflix and Max instead. Neon chose to save costs and avoid releasing it too wide, feeling that Soderbergh's brand could carry it. But it looks like in a sea of horror/thrillers like ***Nosferatu***, ***Wolf Man*** and ***Companion***, this one simply got lost in the shuffle.

According to Neon, 56% of the audience was male and 73% was 25 and over. They gave it a ""C+"" on CinemaScore, which isn't surprising, considering the marketing sells a different film. It's unlikely ***Presence*** can leg it out to $10 million lifetime.

After its weak debut, Blumhouse's ***Wolf Man*** dropped to seventh place, earning $3.2 million. That's a very awful 70% drop from last weekend, far worse than ***The Invisible Woman*** (46.3%) and it's also slightly worse than 2010's ***The Wolfman*** (68.6%). Well, considering the film's tepid response and poor word of mouth, that's not really surprising. Through ten days, the film has earned just $17.6 million, and it will close with just $22 million at most.

Searchlight's ***A Complete Unknown***, coming off its 8 Oscar nominations, had the best drop in the Top 10. It eased a light 18%, adding $3 million this weekend. With that, the film's domestic total now stands at $62.9 million.

In ninth place, ***Den of Thieves: Pantera*** fell a further 55% this weekend, adding $2.9 million. The film has earned $31.8 million, and will now officially close below $40 million domestically.

Rounding up the Top 10 was A24's ***The Brutalist***, coming off its 10 Oscar nominations. It finally hit wide release in 1,118 theaters, and the film earned $2.8 million this weekend. That's a fine start, especially considering its 215-minute runtime limited the amount of screenings. With this, the film's domestic lifetime stands at $9.3 million, and it's gonna continue legging out.

After 10 weekends, ***Wicked*** has finally left the Top 10. But it still eased 34%, adding $2.3 million this weekend and taking its domestic total to $468.7 million.

It's not until the 12th spot where we find Angel Studios' ***Brave the Dark***, which flopped with $2.2 million in 2,230 theaters. That's one of the worst debuts for any film at over 2,000 theaters, and marks another loss for Angel Studios, which has been failling to find a success after ***Sound of Freedom***.

***Nosferatu*** fell 52%, adding $1.9 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $93.1 million, and it looks like it might take some time in reaching $100 million.

***September 5*** expanded to 395 theaters this weekend, earning just $745,064. The film has earned only $1.6 million, and with the lack of awards prospects, it's going to disappear quickly.

After a very confusing platform release, Amazon MGM finally expanded ***Nickel Boys*** into 540 theaters, just as it received 2 Oscar noms. But the film earned just $348,060, which is very low. That took its domestic total to $1.5 million, and it needs some strong word of mouth to leg out.

IFC Films released Neil Burger's new action thriller ***Inheritance*** in 627 theaters, and it flopped with an abysmal $124,817. That's the 13th worst debut for a film playing in over 600 theaters, and it also translates to a putrid $199 per-theater average. It will fade quickly.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Mufasa*** once again led the foreign box office. It added $15.4 million, taking its worldwide total to $627 million. The best markets are France ($38.1M), UK ($34.7M), Mexico ($28.3M), Germany ($27.8M) and Italy ($23.1M).

***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** added $10.6 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $446.3 million. The best markets are the UK ($28.9M), Mexico ($21.1M), France ($18.4M), Australia ($17.1M) and Brazil ($12.3M).

Ahead of its American debut in February, ***Paddington in Peru*** added $6.3 million this weekend, taking its overseas total to $83 million.

***Moana 2*** added $5.8 million, taking its worldwide total to $1.026 billion. The best markets are France ($61.8M), UK ($51.2M), Germany ($44M), Australia ($31.8M) and Japan ($31.6M).

***Nosferatu*** added $4.2 million, and its worldwide total is now $166.5 million. The best markets are the UK ($14.7M), Mexico ($7.8M), Germany ($5.3M), Spain ($5.1M) and Italy ($5.1M).

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Red One* | Nov/15 | Amazon MGM | $32,106,112 | $97,000,759 | $185,895,441 | $250M
*Better Man* | Dec/25 | Paramount | $1,063,901 | $1,983,648 | $13,504,215 | $110M

- The hierarchy of power in the Christmas Cinematic Universe didn't change at all. For ***Red One***, it closed with just $185 million, far below it's $250 million budget. Even if it was supposed to be on streaming, it's still underwhelming that the film couldn't hit $200 million worldwide or $100 million domestically. Is The Rock a draw? Certainly. Does that warrant a high budget? Look up here and ***Black Adam***. 

- Well, this shit is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S. Paramount simply gave up with ***Better Man*** after just 2 weeks in wide release; it will continue playing in who knows how many theaters, but they decided to stop reporting box office numbers. And so the film couldn't hit $2 million domestically. There are a few foreign markets left, but it has zero chance of making a comeback. Very disappointing.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

DreamWorks is returning to the big screen with ***Dog Man***, which is based on Dav Pilkey's children's graphic novel series, and is also a spin-off and story within a story of *Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie*. As the first family animated film (get out of the way, ***Mufasa***) since ***Moana 2***, this has so much on its favor and should easily top the box office.

Another release is WB's ***Companion***, which follows a a weekend getaway among friends at a remote cabin, which unravels into chaos after a revelation that one of the guests is a companion robot. The marketing has been very resistant in showing more of the plot, choosing instead to emphasize its connection to ***Barbarian*** (Zach Cregger is a producer here). With some great reviews so far (94% on RT), perhaps it could surprise.

backtoblack,back to black,1i84vvl,Most unbelievable movie news,"With the rise of social media and the 24-hour news cycle, we're practically inundated with movie news nowadays. Some of it's harmless or predictable enough (such-and-such is coming back for a sequel, a certain film is being remade for the 18th time, etc.). But sometimes...there are announcements from the moment you read them, you're like, ""Yeah, ok...I'll believe it when I see it"". Has anybody else experienced this and if so, what are your favorite examples? Some of mine are...

  
\*To be clear, I'm not taking about fake news. I'm talking about real announcements that either didn't make sense logically or just sounded like pipe dreams\* 

*  Batman v Superman and Captain America: Civil War will open on the same day 
* Quentin Tarantino is making a Star Trek film
* The next Friday the 13th film will be produced by LeBron James
* A 21 Jump Street x Men in Black film is in the works 

And I'm just gonna call my shot with this one...I don't think that Luca Guadagino/Daniel Craig Sgt. Rock movie is gonna happen. I'll be genuinely shocked if it does. ",69,101,1737643409.0,2025-01-23 14:43:29,False
backtoblack,back to black,1i7xx0c,I picked over 300 movies to watch in 2025,"Went through about half my saved lists and carefully sorted them into my IMDb and saved a text file with the selections.  No spending 30 minutes trying to find a movie everytime I want to see one.  All of them can be streamed off the internet.  I pat myself on the back.  Only took 8 hours. I watched 300 movies last year and suppose this year will be about the same.

backtoblack,back to black,1i5qo19,What are some movies where someone gets transported to another world or dimension at the beginning of the movie?,"Magically or quasi-magically, and they spend the rest of the movie in that world, usually having an adventure and returning at the end. This was a very common premise in 80's and 90's movies. I'm trying to compile a decent sized list. Back To The Future is the big one that comes to mind. Also of course The Wizard Of Oz. But for 80's/90's I'm thinking of Blast From The Past, Stay Tuned, Hook, Super Mario Bros (1993), Black Knight, Cool World, The Matrix, Chronicles Of Narnia, Space Jam, Spirited Away. I'm trying to watch some of the campier ones. Please post as many as you can remember.",6,88,1737381357.0,2025-01-20 13:55:57,False
backtoblack,back to black,1i4dvtf,Question for anyone abt the black swan,"Does anyone notice how many shots in the black swan have peoples back muscles and bones showing? Idk if it’s just me hyper fixating on the movie too much or I smoked to much weed but it’s odd how many scenes show their bare backs like during the practices the outfits are all backless, when Nina’s mom was cutting her nails after finding her scratch marks it only showed her back, aswell as when Nina’s dancing with a lady instructor the whole shot was just her back muscles moving up and down as she waved her arms up and down it was so gross looking aswell as lily having a very distinct back tattoo that eventually morphs into a pair of wings later on. But beside the point I feel like it’s trying to say something but I don’t know what I just wanna come on here and ask everyone’s opinion on it and what they think!!

No wrong answers this is almost a theory post !",0,5,1737224830.0,2025-01-18 18:27:10,False
backtoblack,back to black,1i0a4e6,"Recommendations for films with epic, emotional, or dynamic scores?","I love music. I really love music. A great score really completes good films and shows for me. Some of my favourite films, such as PotC: Curse of the Black Pearl, Lion King, LotR, or Interstellar all pull me into the action and emotion with grand themes and orchestras.

Even more so, I love it when a movie makes use of a soundtrack to emphasise action scenes or sequences. Going back to Curse of the Black Pearl, there are a few sword fights in which the swords clash on beats or blasts from the horns. Put more succinctly, I love it when the music synchronises with the visuals.

So yeah! In general, I'm looking for more films with epic, moving scores, with a secondary, more specific request of films that use the music in creative ways. Thank you!",0,40,1736759728.0,2025-01-13 09:15:28,False

backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1jlnw55,Raiders of the Lost Ark is the weakest Indiana Jones film,"Before you have me hung, drawn and quartered, hear me out, I love Raiders and I love all the Indiana Jones films in their own way and none of them are bad I just enjoy the other films more. Also, I'm not going to do the Big Bang Theory thing where Amy says “Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. ""If he weren’t in the movie, the Nazis would still have found the Ark, taken it to the island, opened it up, and all died, just like they did,” because it's a stupid argument to point out Raiders' flaws as it was the first film. Of course, it would have flaws. Even with the knowledge, it doesn't ruin the film or the franchise, plus she can never ruin The Last Crusade (my favourite Indy film). Also its not just the weakest of the trilogy but of the entire franchise which includes Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and Dial of Destiny.

While Raiders of the Lost Ark is still a classic action-adventure film, the plot while very enjoyable is also very paint by numbers with a very anticlimactic ending. I guess I expected more, but after being hyped about how amazing this film is, I just found it to be just good and not great. I think that Raiders is the weakest film in the franchise as I think the other films improve on the formula that Raiders created, especially Last Crusade. But I still like it, with stunts, explosions, comedy, thills, horror and Nazis being killed. Raiders will forever be a classic.",0,27,1743139539.0,2025-03-28 05:25:39,False
backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1jkv22h,Heat- Clash of the Titans,"https://preview.redd.it/1w1adpvxg5re1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fe7c8a97f6e05e19c820d1b251939c827f6c97e

Two great actors facing off each other, and a director like Michael Mann, Heat came with a lot of expectations and hype.  Did it really live up to it?

Robert De Niro is  Neil Mc Cauley, an expert thief, and Al Pacino is Vincent Hanna, a top LAPD cop, with a messy personal life.  As he puts it in his own words.

*My life’s a disaster zone. I got a stepdaughter so f\*\*d up because her real father’s this large-type asshole. I got a wife, we’re passing each other on the down-slope of a marriage – my third – because I spend all my time chasing guys like you around the block. That’s my life.*

Mc Cauley on the other hand lives by a simple principle.

*A guy told me one time, “Don’t let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.” Now, if you’re on me and you gotta move when I move, how do you expect to keep a… a marriage.*

His gang consists of  Chris Shiherlis( Val Kilmer) and Michael Cheritto( Tom Sizemore). The movie begins with a theft of 1.6 million USD worth US bearer bonds from an armored car. And in the ensuing fracas, the 3 guards are shot dead. Nate( Jon Voight) who often buys most of the stolen property of Mc Cauley, suggests that he sell back the bonds to their original owner Roger Van Zant for a handsome profit. 

However Van Zant double crosses them, and Mc Cauley escapes, swearing revenge. Vincent Hanna is assigned the case, while McCauley  is busy planning his next major heist, a 12 million USD bank robbery. 

Heat is a typical cops and robbers tale, and for action movie buffs, has some really great scenes. the first attempt on the armored car, the street fight between the cops and robbers after the bank robbery and the final show down in the airport.

My personal favorite would be the fight after the bank robbery, you can actually feel the bullets whizzing around, the noise, the chaos.  As some one put it gunfire sounds different in a Mann movie. 

The action scenes apart, it is the way Mann looks into the interpersonal relationships, and the characters of Hanna and McCauley are written, that is it's biggest strength.  Both of them are loners, McCauley does have a relationship going on with Eady( Amy Brennerman), a graphic designer, but he prefers to be by himself. Hanna on the other hand has a disastrous personal life,his 3rd marriage to Justine( Diane Venora) is on the rocks, and he has a troubled relationship with his step daughter Laura( Natalie Portman), whom he loves dearly. 

On the other hand  Shiherlis wife Charlene( Ashley Judd) is slowly being estranged from him due to his gambling addiction, and to make matters worse she is cheating on him with Marciano( Hank Azaria).

The famous restaurant scene is one of the best in the movie, where the two of them meet, both of them not willing to concede an inch.  No dramatics, no action, just two blokes having a casual chat about their lives and relationships.

*Vincent Hanna: You know, we are sitting here, you and I, like a couple of regular fellas. You do what you do, and I do what I gotta do. And now that we’ve been face to face, if I’m there and I gotta put you away, I won’t like it. But I tell you, if it’s between you and some poor bastard whose wife you’re gonna turn into a widow, brother, you are going down.*

*Neil McCauley: There is a flip side to that coin. What if you do got me boxed in and I gotta put you down? Cause no matter what, you will not get in my way. We’ve been face to face, yeah. But I will not hesitate. Not for a second.*

This was first time De Niro and Pacino, came face to face on screen, they were there earlier in Godfather 2 but did not come together. Later they came together in the forgettable Righteous Kill and the Irishman, one of my favorites.

Pacino's role as the washed out cop, is something right up his alley, having done a similiar kind in Sea of Love, and he is as superb as ever. Robert De Niro is as great as ever as the loner crook, with a street smart attitude.

Apart from these 2, Heat also has one strong supporting cast in Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman, Tom Sizemore each having really good roles. ",0,2,1743046875.0,2025-03-27 03:41:15,False
backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1jbyn45,Gone Girl and Amazing Amy,"So I just rewatched Gone Girl after about 10 years, love the movie. Just thought about it and don't see it much discussed, can the reason why Amy feels the need to live a perfect life (or have a perfect marriage) stem from her parents character Amazing Amy? Just something that I don't think is really underlined in the movie but a fun thing to think about. Maybe it's touched on more in the book? ",2,29,1742055332.0,2025-03-15 16:15:32,False

The ending too was fucked. How could nick live with her knowing damn well she's a psychopath. And why does he like her as stated by his sister?

Also a plothole in my opinion was that after Amy told the cops about her story of being kidnapped by Desi, the cops must've investigated on Desi and when he had brought her to the villa. Because it surely wasn't the day Amy took off from her home. So wtf happened there? This is so shitty ending I don't know why it keeps getting praised.

backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1iviek1,Why did no one tell me Crank (2006) was such a crazy balls to wall movie? Jason Statham's greatest performance. Seriously under-hyped action-comedy.,"Obviously, the title is slightly tongue in cheek, and Crank is a popular, well-known movie. I think it deserves to be seen as an action comedy classic and an archetype of how to make a great fast paced 90 min movie, however. The budget seems fairly mid-range with the various action sequences.

The movie is so frenetic from the very start.  Jason Statham is just goddamn marvelous in it. His greatest performance I have ever seen. 

I'd always thought Statham's best performance was in Snatch. That may be the best movie he's starred in - but Crank has to be the best performance for me. It seems like he's up for anything. It's a satirical self-deprecating Statham performance, like in Spy with Melissa McCarthy. Just really fun.

This movie starts with the foot on the accelerator and doesn't stop, getting more and more crazy as Chev (Statham) fights against the poison in his body - he has to keep his heart rate high to stop it from killing him. 

The action is fun and the movie is very funny. It sort of feels like I am watching a movie version of GTA at times as Chev is just like one of their protagonists and causes utter carnage - I honestly think it must have been inspired by those games (with Sanandreas out a couple years prior). Statham bears a striking resemblance to the look and feel of characters from the later GTA games - so it may have worked both ways.

Amy Smart is so utterly sexy as the girlfriend Eve. A scene stealing role. There's some funny scenes and hijinks where she's getting on with her normal life, lolling about in bed high, trying to fix the microwave clock, while all this crazy pandemonium is kicking off all around her. I love how this film doesn't take itself seriously but is also extremely unrelenting.
 
There's one uncomfortable scene with Chev and Eve which shows the film's age. >!The public sex scene!<. This scene kind of has a >!rapey!< moment that will have you squirming but then it relents and makes up for it with a very funny crazy sequence.

I feel like this film doesn't get the recognition it deserves. I never knew it was so damn good and I'm a huge film fan. I always got the impression it was just a run of the mill noughties action movie.

Edit: >!Just got to the part where Chev and the bad guy fall out the helicopter and through the sky, and continue to argue and fight eachother. Then, after winning, Chev proceeds to make a phonecall while peacefully falling to his death. Again, so so funny.!<",1315,245,1740229862.0,2025-02-22 13:11:02,False
backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1iv5yq2,I'm obsessed with To Die For (1995),"I don't know if this qualifies as a review but I'm a die hard Nicole Kidman yet I had never seen To Die For. I'm 27 so I've followed her current work more closely and had only seen Eyes Wide Shut from her older filmography. 

I ended up watching To Die For (1995) last month and ever since, I've seen it three times, I'm completely obsessed with it. Nicole was perfection as Suzanne, she was so charming and charismatic, I loved her mannerisms and she had me rooting for her in a few moments and also feeling bad for her at the same time for not being able to pursue her career. Everyone was great, especially the actress who played Larry's sister, Joaquin and the actress who played Lydia. 

I also loved the little Easter Eggs I noticed on my rewatch, like when they first show the abandoned house while Suzanne screams in the background and when she goes to the station to drop her curriculum and she's talking to Ed and she's taking a letter from her bag and just puts it back when she sees George, that was hilarious. I also only noticed later that she slept with that journalist in Miami but I guess I'm just dense lol 

I also love Gone Girl and Rosamund Pike and I read that she watched To Die For as an inspiration for Amy so I was expecting Suzanne to be more chilling, cold and calculated and while she was all that, I think the movie carried a certain humour that I really enjoyed. Also loved Suzanne's outfits and how bright the colors were, I absolutely hate the trend where films and shows nowadays feel the need to turn off all the lights on set and everything is dark af. 

Just really enjoyed the movie, gave it a 4/5 because I wished we could've seen how Suzanne's plan started, I could understand why she wanted to kill Larry but the plan felt so sloppy and it'd so easy to track back the boys to her, and I think her plan would be more elaborate idk. 

Just wondering if anyone else is also a fan and your thoughts about To Die For!",23,20,1740183144.0,2025-02-22 00:12:24,False
backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1itlqyx,Oscar Bingo XII Submission Thread,"#Welcome to Oscar Bingo XII. I'll be your host, [LiteraryBoner](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/3/well-dressed-animal-10-lizard-matthias-hauser.jpg). For over a decade now we keep coming back to this silly game in which **YOU, the users** suggest things that might actually happen at the live ceremony of the Academy Awards. Then our friends over at www.print-bingo.com create us a game card generator so we can all play in real time on March 2nd.

Okay, let's get in to it!

* [Last year's submission thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1b3c4fv/official_oscar_bingo_submission_xi_thread/)

* [List of nominees for this year](https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2025)

Here's how it works!

**Submit ideas for things that might happen during the Oscars.**

* **Max 80 characters** as to fit on in the bingo squares

* Do **NOT** put more than one submission in a single comment. That cannot be voted on properly and will be removed. 

* Live ceremony only, no red carpet or off camera awards

* Predicting specific wins, such as Emilia Perez wins Best Picture, will not be considered as they limit possibilities (And who wants to wait until the final five minutes to get a Bingo?)

* Please try and keep submissions within reason and not too specific. 

* Use the list of presenters to try and guess what the bits or featured films will be!

* This thread will be randomized and votes hidden. If there's lots of suggestions be sure to refresh a few times or scroll for a bit to spread the love!

**Once we have collected submissions for a couple of days, we will un-sticky the thread and start to make game cards with your suggestions. Our friends over at *www.print-bingo.com* will again be doing some specialty work with us for this.**

* We will post a gamecard pickup thread the Friday before the Oscars (the 28th). All you will have to do is follow the link in the thread, do the captcha, and a small link will appear to your gamecard PDF. 

**We'll post the game thread Oscar Sunday. The point of the Game Thread is to discuss game related things and for me to make final decisions on the more open to interpretation squares. It will be stickied as will all these threads.**

backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1iqgqxm,Arrival (2016) ... my thoughts after a rewatch.,"Can’t help it on this write up, so here is the SPOILER WARNING for the movie Arrival (2016).

I remember first seeing a trailer for Arrival and thinking to myself, “I want to see that. It looks similar to an episode of X-Files, and I like X-Files.” Well, I was wrong, this movie was nothing like the X-Files. This movie was a sci-fi about the arrival of extraterrestrial aliens, but really, it’s about working together, language, and fate.

I love languages. I find them fascinating. I am fluent in English, studied Spanish in high school, went to Spain for about 5 months when I was 19-20, and have also spent some free time studying French, Russian, Japanese, and ASL. I suck at all of these languages, including English, I’ve always been best at the language of physics, a.k.a., math. So by having the main character be a linguist, and the supporting actor role a theoretical physicist, it was great to see a science fiction story focus on communication rather than science.

The first time I saw this movie, it was in theaters, and I didn't know that the twist was even going to be part of it. When the movie started and there is a montage of Amy Adams and her daughter who the show gets sick and dies, I could only think to myself that this movie was going to contain some sort of “work through depression” or “find inspiration though loss” theme. This is why I loved the twist so much. It took an expectation which I found to be a bit boring, and turned it into something I had never seen before. I had heard about the theory that the way one perceives the world is connected to the language they speak, but the idea that it can change the way we perceive time made it unique. Now the film gets to explore time travel, how fun!

Here is the problem, the second time I watched this movie, it was at home. I hadn’t realized before the second watch, how much the sound and the visuals of this film really benefit from watching it in a movie theater. Knowing the twist upon rewatch was fun, it is amazing how right in front it is, but it makes the overall experience less. I guess if you’re reading this, it’s too late, but it would be best to recommend that you know as little as possible about this movie before watching it.

Two little things I love about this movie:

* The language of the heptapods is written in circle shapes. No beginning, no end.
* The aliens are named Abbott and Costello, whose (perhaps) most famous skit is about the misinterpretation of words. (Who’s on first?)",0,21,1739668579.0,2025-02-16 01:16:19,False
backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1ilcjay,Kinda Pregnant - Netflix Movie Dicussion Thread,"I expected this to be bottom of the barrel bad, but it did have its moments and it was nice to watch an easy Sunday evening rom com (albeit I have already almost forgotten most of the jokes). 

In terms of the cast I thought Amy Schumer and Will Forte had their funny moments, but I thought Brianne Howey was the stand out as a mum not coping with the joys of pregnancy and family life. Urzila Carlson, Damon Wayans Jr and Lizzie Broadway did however overstay their welcome in some scenes. 

It’s harmless and the premise is silly, but it’s nice to see a brain off rom com once in a while. It’s also your typical shiny Netflix movie for the majority of it, but it doesn’t feel as stale as the recent Back in Action because the sets and cinematography all feel pretty standard rom com.

backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1iky56h,The 2017 movie “Escaping Dad” was well done.,"I think the movie “Escaping Dad” was well done and also I love that Courtney Henggeler (Stacy) was the one to help Sunny Mabrey (Erin). I also love that Henggeler was the one cast into the best friend and ptotection roles.

Erin is in an abusive marriage with her husband Darren and so she takes her children with her and they set off from Oklahoma for California where her best friend Stacy lives.

It felt like a nice touch, the whole theme … where at the beginning it starts with Darren and Erin’s 10th anniversary party happening and it is happening somewhere where friends of Darren are there and Erin has no one and she’s stuck in the abuse.

Then some days later after the party, Stacy is visiting her in town and when she finds out about Darren abusing Erin, she tells Erin to come to California with the kids.

Also, Erin soon meets a trucker named Wes, who drives her and the kids to California and soon at the end of the movie, Erin saves his life when Darren tries to strangle him with a boat rope and Erin shoots Darren with his gun and they begin a romance.

\- - - -

I love how starting from the beginning, Erin, who is in her abusive marriage with Darren and she was surrounded by people he knows (and don’t know his true nature) and she had no friends around and she meets her own best friends and who offers her support and safety and Erin takes herself and her children away from danger and Darren’s abuse to safety and Stacy’s love and support and who has been Erin’s best friend for many years, more than 10 at least, given that Stacy had attended Erin and Darren’s wedding.

It was also nice that they meet Wes, who gladly takes them to California where Stacy and her husband Jason live and Erin soon develops a romance with him at the end and it seems that he lives with Stacy, Jason, Erin, Amy and Charlie.

What I think could’ve been done better are these:

* Jason and Stacy should be living in a large mansion
* Darren should've been Charlie's stepfather too, not his real father.
* Darren interacts with Jason and Stacy and they both fight him along with Wes when they come to the rescue
* Jason and Stacy also have a daughter who is also kidnapped along with Amy by Darren
* Amy is younger than 17.
* Amy and Charlie are full siblings and their real dad died years ago.
* In the end, Wes has a new job ... and a good one. But I don't know what.",0,3,1739050022.0,2025-02-08 21:27:02,False

backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1i6cfhe,Thoughts on Zack Snyder as a director ,"I recently watched BvS, Watchmen, and some other ZS films and have amassed some thoughts both good and bad

The good, he is undeniably a visual genius, I know some critics give him shit for the sound stages and green screen but I think he shoots on real locations just enough for you to get immersed and his sets are usually very well produced and designed so as to not feel claustrophobic or ""movie"" fake ya know? Because usually I hate blue screen shots and sound stages. I think they make a film feel hollow and tiny. Endgame for example, the final battle, I feel asyphixated. It feels itty bitty to me. But Zack has a way of shooting this that makes it still feel grand and epic. Sucker Punch, 300, BvS, Watchmen, JL, Superman. All have examples of this. (Except the doomsday fight + parts of sucker punch looks awful)

His eye for action is exceptional, it all feels appropriately cinematic. His fight scenes are some of the best in cinema arguably. Not even joking. To date, I've never felt the power of superhuman beings captured so perfectly quite like Man of Steel. I've never seen that awe inspiring, forceful, impactful display of such powerful abilities before or since. He's also shot most of his films, well, on film, and they look great. The color grading, and the black levels. I'm going full film school geek mode here but I know a director has a great grasp of the technical when im watching a movie and think ""man those blacks are so deep"".

The bad, oh boy. First of all, he has juvenile sensibitlies. I find his movies at times eye rollingly blunt and obvious. You might as well have a 14 year old boy behind the camera. Some creative choices, editing, music choice, and shot choice are decisions I could unironically see myself making when I was in middle school. It takes you out of the film and makes them feel dated and hollow. It's hard to be engrossed when youre thinking ""dude really? that was so cheesy"" ""oh my god that was beyond over the top"" etc

He also does not work well with actors. At all. Maybe his biggest weakness. Everyone in watchmen except JEH (Rorschach) sucks. Maybe Patrick Wilson gets a pass but it is an aggressively poorly acted movie. In DC, he managed to make incredible actors terrible. How do you make Amy Adams awful? How do you make Jesse Einsenberg awful? Sucker Punch is also terribly acted. His extras like in JL, watchmen, 300 are almost always terrible. Seems like he struggled to get good performances out of people while hes focused on visuals.

Lastly, he seemingly has issues with his coverage footage, what I mean by this is, he shoots way too much for theatrical. He assembles too much footage and has to butcher his own films in post. This is a extremely amateur move and speaks to the aformentioned excessive over the top lack of restraint. I mean one or two strikes hey maybe he got carried away, but no, Sucker Punch, Watchmen, BvS, Justice League. I mean jesus christ dude how many times before you learn to just get a lean script and shoot what you absolutely need.

Anyways, that all I got, what do you guys think?",0,64,1737440645.0,2025-01-21 06:24:05,False

backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1hvnuw4,My ranking of 2024! ,"I’m going by U.K. release dates, it’s just easier for me and it means I don’t spend the first two months of the year adding movies to my previous year’s lists 

1. The Zone of Interest – One of the most powerful movies I’ve ever seen. Such a simple concept, but so impactful, putting you directly into the shoes of evil in a way that leaves you so unsettled even as the end credits roll. And obviously the sound design is absolutely fantastic, but the visuals and filming style also leave a massive impact. 
2. Challengers – So well structured and tightly plotted, the relationship development and the drama was so good and the end was especially unforgettable. 

3. The Wild Robot – Such a beautiful story of love and nature and community and found family, with absolutely stunning animation. 
4. Conclave – From the stunning cinematography and the colours to the political machinations of the conclave itself, everything about this movie is so tightly done. Explores so much and it never feels like a theme or plot line is under explored or skipped over. The politics unfolds perfectly and it leaves you with so many ideas to think about. And, although everyone in the movie is great, Ralph Fiennes especially has to get best lead actor for this! 
5. All Of Us Strangers – A powerful story about grief and loneliness which lingers long after the end credits and Paul Mescal and Andrew Scott are both wonderful in it. 
6. Wicked – One of my all time favourite musicals and the incredibly long wait was so worth it! An adaptation that retained everything great about the original show, with a stellar cast, brilliant choreography and just enough expansion to round out the plot for the big screen. 
7. His Three Daughters – A deeply emotional and heartfelt portrayal of grief and family, with highly affecting performances from the three leads, and very cleverly directed. 
8. Daughters – An incredibly moving and powerful must watch documentary, about an incredible program, which allows incarcerated fathers to have a father daughter dance with their daughters. It’s also immaculately directed by Angela Patton and Natalie  Rae and they do such a good job at weaving so many stories together, while simultaneously deftly exploring the deeper issues at play within the US prison system. 
9. Lisa Frankenstein – Totally weird and unique in the best way possible, very darkly funny, great set design and costuming and a very fun plot overall. Feels like a Heathers-esque future cult classic. 
10. Wicked Little Letters – fantastic writing and dialogue, really funny, brilliant performances and I loved that it was a true story 
11. One Life – A beautiful true story and it made me cry. 
12. The End We Start From – A story of hope, resilience and survival in hard times, with a great lead performance from Jodi Comer. 
13. American Fiction – a very funny, biting and incredibly well written satire, which effortlessly explores many complex themes, whilst also functioning very effectively as a comedy at the same time. 
14. My Old Ass – A really funny and surprisingly emotional examination 
15. The Outrun – A wonderful performance from Saiorse Ronan, a story about addiction, crashing and rising back up and I loved how cyclical, dreamy and hazy the whole thing felt. The cinematography and locations also stunning. 
16. Seize Them — Absolutely hilarious, very well written and a 10/10 cast. 
17. The Bikeriders – An epic and well told deconstruction of biker culture, which maintains multiple stories at once and does all of them justice, while also telling a very interesting and tragic true story
18. Wallace and Gromit: Vengance Most Fowl – A wonderful comeback for one of the best animated franchises of all time. Witty, so many funny details, a great commentary on AI and it was just lovely to have Wallace and Gromit back on Christmas Day. 
19. Better Man – A bold, original, creative and very emotionally compelling biopic with a great soundtrack 
20. Snack Shack – A warm, witty, nostalgic, summery and overall very  funny portrayal of teenage life
21. The Fall Guy – A great surprise and a fantastic tribute to stunt people. Very funny, meta, emotionally impactful and it had a great love story. 
22. Woman of The Hour – this manages to be a fantastic portrayal of a real life story, an exploration of the dangers women face even today and a really tightly made thriller. A fantastic directorial debut for Anna Kendrick, who also does a great job in the lead role. 
23. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice – One of my biggest pleasant surprises of the year. So fun and funny! Just a great, creative, madcap adventure. And I loved the use of practical effects. 
24. Dune Part 2 – Epic, incredible cinematography, great performances and much more tightly plotted than the first film. 
25. We Live In Time – Warm, funny and heartbreaking at the same time. And I loved seeing Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh together. 
26. The Color Purple – A big, bright, colourful, unapologetic musical, with a classic empowering and beautiful story of a woman who goes through so much and finds her identity with the support of other women. 
27. Kneecap – As funny as it is dynamically filmed, it also has some great deeper messages at play. 
28. The Holdovers – Another cozy and funny Christmas movie, with a strong emotional core and great character development. 
29. That Christmas – A very heartwarming, funny and cozy Christmas film. 
30. Monkey Man – A well paced, well directed and emotional action thriller.  
31. Blitz – A great snapshot of a fascinating moment in history, with great cinematography and a really epic feel overall. I also really enjoyed the way that George was able to explore and examine his identity as a mixed race child in England at this time. Although the blitz is so covered as a historical period, this really did feel like a fresh perspective. 
32. The Piano Lesson – a classic play, well built tension and a stellar cast. 
33. Gladiator 2 – Not a massively strong plot, but epic, stunningly shot and highly enjoyable overall. 
34. Joy – A heartwarming portrayal of an important story and a lovely tribute to its characters. 
35. Jim Henson: Idea Man – A loving, informative and creatively made tribute to an incredible man with an incredible life. 
36. Young Woman and the Sea – A very interesting biopic with some stunning cinematography. 
37. Love Lies Bleeding – A really tense and well made crime thriller, with good performances and an interesting critique on toxic and abusive relationships.
38. Civil War – A really pleasant surprise and not what I expected at all. A biting and fascinating exploration of the ethics of war reporting and photojournalism. The only reason it’s not much higher is that (and I do understand what they were trying to do with it tbf), I felt the vagueness of the conflict with clues hidden here and there distracted a bit from what the film was trying to say and explore overall. 
39. Anora – Overall, Anora is a fascinating, funny and moving character and trope de-construction. The only reason it’s not much higher on my list is that the middle drags a bit and the dialogue is pretty repetitive at times. 
40. Fancy Dance – A moving film with an especially good performance from Lily Gladstone, exploring issues faced by indigenous families to great emotional impact. But I did think it ended a bit abruptly without much resolution. 
41. The Critic – An intriguing murder mystery with lots of twists and turns, as well as great performances, especially from Ian Mckellen. 
42. Paddington in Peru – Not as good as the first two Paddington films, but still a fun and funny adventure that’s well worth a watch. 
43. Moana 2 – stunning animation and an enjoyable plot. The only three things that drag it down a bit for me: the music isn’t nearly as good as the first one and the fact that you can hear that it’s an attempt to mimic LMM’s music from the first movie made it worse. The villains were pretty weak. And without spoiling it too much I wasn’t a big fan of certain things that happen to Moana at the end. 
44. Lee – A really interesting insight into someone with an extraordinary life. Kate Winslet and Andy Samberg were great in it too. 
45. Carry On – A tense and enjoyable thriller that builds up its plot well. Not a masterpiece, but a really fun afternoons’ watch. 
46. Bad Tidings – A great Christmas comedy with two of my favourite comedians.
47. Rob Peace – A lovely tribute to someone with a tragic life.
48. Deadpool and Wolverine – funny with a very clever meta narrative and a great use of music. I didn’t like the first Deadpool that much and I skipped the second one, but this is absolutely the strongest of the trilogy.
49. Bob Marley: One Love – A really interesting insight into an icon. 
50. Inside Out 2 – As funny, clever and emotionally effective as the last film. But it just gave me everything I liked about the first film and didn’t really push the boundaries of the Inside Out world in the way that it could have and that I hoped it would. 
51. Suncoast – An emotionally affecting film with great performances. Nico Parker is especially great, but Woody Harrelson’s character feels a bit pointless and the mum is pretty terrible. 
52. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire – A fun and funny addition to an iconic for a reason franchise. 
53. Turtles All The Way Down – A cute teen film with an especially effective portrayal of the mental health side of the story. But some of the subplots did feel a bit bizarre and unecessary with not so great execution. 
54. Mother’s Instinct – a fairly standard slightly soapy thriller with good performances that builds tension well. 
55. Shirley – An interesting story, but not told in an overly exciting way. 
56. Fly Me To The Moon – A sweet and entertaining love story that just dragged a bit too much towards the end for me. 
57. Mean Girls – I had fun with this especially as a musical theatre fan. The music from the Broadway show is good, it was funny and the performances were enjoyable. But it was a bit dragged down by some of the adaptation choices, mainly in the music. It felt like they were ashamed that it was a musical and that they kept trying to de-Broadway the songs to make it “cool”, which I didn’t feel was necessary. 
58. Spaceman – An interesting and surprisingly emotional concept, even if it was a bit strange. 
59. Kinds Of Kindness – great cast and interesting thematic links between the three stories, but I felt it went on a bit too long in the end. 
60. Find Me Falling – just a bland Netflix romance. Not the worst thing I’ve ever seen but not great either. 
61. Damsel – although it was very generic girl power and wasn’t the best quality overall, the action was entertaining and I did find the plot engaging. 
62. The Garfield Movie – This was cute and fairly entertaining for what it was, but didn’t go beyond that for me. 
63. Drive Away Dolls – This had some potential as a witty crime caper, but the plot felt thin, rushed and underdeveloped for me. 
64. The Hit Man – I get that the characters being terrible was kind of the point, but I didn’t find them or the film as a whole very engaging. 
65. A Different Man – I felt like this had so much potential in the beginning, but once the post change stuff started I didn’t really understand what it was trying to say, other than saying that the struggles we saw throughout the entire first half was just because of his attitude, which is a terrible message if that was the intention. 
66. Back To Black – the actress playing Amy Winehouse did a decent job, but it focused way too much on her personal life and not nearly enough on her music and felt like it didn’t do her justice overall. 
67. Emilia Pérez – A not too bad idea executed in the most bizarre and jarring way possible. 
68. The Persian Version – I was excited for this one from the trailer, but it felt like the director wanted to tell so many different stories and couldn’t effectively concentrate on any of them. 
69. A Family Affair – Started off kind of funny at the very beginning with Zack Efron playing a big headed movie star, but the plot got very strange and terrible very quickly. 
70. Despicable Me 4 – As someone who honestly loved the first Despicable Me, it’s been so sad to see all the heart slowly sapped out of the franchise, with this nothing of a film being the end result. It’s funny in some places, but there’s so little plot, heart and character development that it’s honestly depressing. All the characters and situations are just a vehicle for comedy, with nothing else added in, leaving the whole thing feeling empty overall. ",0,12,1736242517.0,2025-01-07 09:35:17,False

backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1hqqzjn,The Hudsucker Proxy (1994) is the New Year's Eve movie you are looking for,"Synopsis: Greedy executive Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman) hopes to take control of the company he works for by purchasing a majority share -- but he must first devalue the stock. So he convinces the board to appoint know-nothing recent graduate Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins). But Mussburger's plot backfires when Barnes' latest invention succeeds, thereby increasing the company's value. Worse yet, undercover reporter Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh) has the scoop on Mussburger's shady dealings.

Honestly, the synopsis doesn't do it justice.  Especially with Tim Robbins' huge role in Silo, coming back to watch his earnest performance as Norville Barnes is a breath of fresh air.  You'll find deliciously satirical writing and direction from the Coen Brothers, knock out performances by Newman and Leigh - the Hudsucker Proxy is an overlooked gem.  With the focus around New Year's Eve, there is no better time to watch this amazing movie if you've never seen it before.  Infinitely quotable, excellently acted, and supremely unique, I hope more people take the time to watch one of my favorite movies tonight.",323,69,1735688689.0,2024-12-31 23:44:49,False

backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1ho6mzf,I saw 298 movies in theaters in 2024. Here is my full ranking.,"Every year I try to go to the movies as much as possible. It’s my main hobby. I keep track of my thoughts/scores throughout the year, along with all of my ticket stubs. In theaters, I saw: 5 movies in 2015, 9 movies in 2016, 146 movies in 2017, 162 movies in 2018, 192 movies in 2019, 44 movies in 2020, 86 movies in 2021, 270 movies in 2022, 325 movies in 2023, and 298 movies this year. This doesn’t include rewatches, but those are pretty rare for me (7 this year). This is my 7th year doing this ranking on /r/movies. 

I have a subscription with AMC’s A-List, Regal’s Unlimited, and Cinemark’s MovieClub. I’m also a member of the Fort Lauderdale, Miami, and Toronto film societies. 

I attended 8 film festivals this year, for a total of 117 films. I attended 24 World Premieres, 11 North American Premieres, 7 US Premieres, 10 East Coast Premieres, 22 Southeast Premieres, 4 Canadian Premieres, and a few Florida/Georgia Premieres. 

96 of my screenings had cast and/or crew present for Q&As/intros. 

I do these rankings and reviews/random thoughts for fun. It’s not meant to be taken super seriously. I just like movies, and I like ranking them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Red Rooms** - 10/10 - The most gripping psychological-thriller since *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*.  Extremely disturbing and unsettling at times, but also stylish and sleek. The courtroom scenes and vampire-movie-like score stick with you for a long time. Juliette Gariépy puts in the best performance of anyone this year. There's so much amazing stuff happening with French-Canadian cinema recently and this is another great addition. Best movie of the year. One of the best movies of the past decade.

**Dune: Part Two** - 9/10 - Sci-fi doesn't get much better than this. I have the seemingly-unpopular opinion that the first movie is better than the second, but both are near-perfect. Everything that can be said about Dune 1/2 has pretty much already been said. 

**Anora** - 9/10

**Civil War** - 9/10

**Nosferatu** - 9/10 - Gothic horror is so back. Lily-Rose Depp does things in this movie physically that I've never seen before on the big screen. Extremely impressed with her performance (and with Hoult/Dafoe/Skarsgard/Corrin as well). A great ensemble surrounded with perfect set design, direction, and cinematography. Loved the scenes in the castle that almost appeared black-and-white. Robert Eggers has not missed for me so far, and this is my favorite of his.

**Challengers** - 9/10

**Sing Sing** - 9/10 - Colman Domingo, give that man his Oscar [John Malkovich Rounders voice].

**The Substance** - 9/10

**You Are Not Alone** - 9/10 -	Part La La Land, part Under the Skin, part Eternal Sunshine. A beautiful and hypnotic sci fi love story with a slight horror edge and with layers upon layers of metaphor.  It has a lot of interesting things to say about mid-20s loneliness/thoughts of suicide/love/etc.

**Didi** - 9/10 -  I'm a sucker for coming-of-age dramas set in recent times. Give me more of this and mid90s-type movies pls.

**The Order** - 8/10

**We Live In Time**	- 8/10 - I went in expecting heartbreak (which I got), but I didn’t expect how funny/sharp it would be. Florence and Andrew have 10/10 chemistry. Only thing keeping it from a higher score is the goofy Super Bowl of Food or whatever scene near the end. The scene at the beginning in the parking garage might be one of the most heart wrenching and well-acted scenes of the entire year. Top-tier score as well.

**Love Lies Bleeding** - 8/10 - I would watch a 2-hour movie montage of Katy O'Brian working out beneath a highway underpass. A violent & twisted mess of sweat/blood/sex/tears/ungodly bodily noises. A real wicked fun time.

**The Goldman Case** - 8/10 - French courtroom dramas, so hot right now. An insanely smart and water-tight screenplay with engrossing performances. It reminded me a lot of Anatomy of a Fall then I realized the co-star (Arthur Harari) in this film is the co-writer of Anatomy.

**The Beast** - 8/10 - A movie that's almost impossible to describe but I'll try: Dystopian-future-sci-fi, period-drama, modern-incel-breakin-thriller, all while staying completely original and beautiful. Extremely layered story and performances. Lea Seydoux and George MacKay are 2 of my favorite actors and they pulled this off with extreme precision and care. One of more harrowing final scenes of the year for sure. 

**Conclave** - 8/10

**Saturday Night** - 8/10 - Frenetic, engaging, and a really fun time. Flies by. I wanted more. So much energy.

**September 5** - 8/10

**The Brutalist** - 8/10 - I have some problems with the ending, feels like it undid a lot of what was experienced, but otherwise an impressive monster of a movie. Brody and Pearce are outstanding.

**Io Capitano** - 8/10

**Fremont** - 8/10 - I love movies that flow like light poems, like Petite Maman or Journey to A Mother's Room. It was a very sweet and cozy. The psychiatry sessions in particular were hilarious, and the bit where the diners are reading their fortunes in the restaurants were perfect. One of my favorite lines of the year is when the old lady fortune cookie writer dies at her desk, and the boss says “she was getting too old to write about the future anyway”. The lead and Jeremy Allen White were only onscreen together but their chemistry was infectious

**Seagrass** - 8/10

**LaRoy, Texas** - 8/10 - A hilariously-dark Coen Brothers throwback with wonderful performances from Steve Zahn and John Magaro (who I was lucky enough to meet prior to the screening). It's bloody and smart, and that's a rare combination.

**A Quiet Place: Day One** - 8/10

**The Last Showgirl** - 8/10 - Apart from a few awkward line-deliveries and questionable dialogue in spots, this was a very lowkey, engaging drama with a career-best performances from Pamela Anderson and Dave Bautista. Very dreamy and light.

**Friendship**	- 8/10 - It's so fucking stupid. Absolutely no plot to speak of. There's no character development. It's barely even a movie. It's basically a 90-minute sketch. All that being said, it's so goddamn hilarious. Non-stop laughs. Most I've laughed since Red Rocket probably. It's a can't-miss for any Tim Robinson fan and a can't-miss for any fans of laughing. Kate Mara was the perfect foil character. 

**The Wild Robot** - 8/10 - Yes, I cried, what of it?

**Relay** - 8/10 - A very solid, tight, throwback to the type of paranoid corporate-thrillers they don’t really make anymore. A super fun twist that I didn’t see coming at all, and a standout turn from Lily James. It slightly loses its way near the end.

**Good One** - 8/10 - Familiar and lowkey, but with a dark edge that slowly reveals itself, and a superb breakout role from Lily Collias. Great debut film from director India Donaldson.

**A Complete Unknown**	- 8/10 - There's definitely a lack of plot but at the end of the day we all just want to see Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits performed by a generational talent in Timothee Chalamet and it definitely delivers in that aspect.

**Midwives** - 8/10 - One of the more stressful movies I’ve seen in a while. My anxiety was through the roof, especially in the first half. It’s so realistic and graphic at times (and some of it *has* to be real, some birth scenes especially) that you almost get a sense that it’s a documentary. Totally nails the landing too, making you feel real anger/empathy about how Midwives are treated in France (and other places I assume).

**Hellbent On Boogie** - 8/10	

**Alien: Romulus** - 8/10 - Put Cailee Spaeny in anything and I'll watch it.

**Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga** - 8/10	

**The Old Oak** - 8/10 - British realism cinema at it's finest. Just another classic added to Ken Loach's resume.

**Longlegs** - 8/10	

**Babygirl** - 8/10	

**One Life** - 8/10 - I'm not a huge movie-cryer but I was absolutely balling my eyes out near the ""moment"". You know it's coming and it's still hit. Impressive when a movie can do that. Last movie that hit me like that was probably Tori and Lokita, and before that Moonlight. This was up there in terms of tears. Did not really expect it going in. Devasting. Anthony Hopkins kills these types of roles, he has a way of showing bottled up regret/sadness that not many others can.

**The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare** - 8/10 - Over-the-top violent fun time. Totally ridiculous but it doesn't take itself seriously and that's what keeps it from veering into. Also, Eiza Gonzalez. That is all.

**Strange Darling** - 8/10

**Los Frikis** - 8/10	

**Suncoast** - 8/10	

**Drive-Away Dolls** - 8/10 - I want more unapologetically horny movies like this. Loved all of Beanie Feldstein's bits and the slow, sleep-deprived descent into madness of the henchmen especially. Not too sure abou the weird-cheap transitions and trippy scenes though.  ""You're a day late and a penis short"" and ""Suki that's your wall dildo!"" are two of the funniest lines of the year, within context. Give me more fast-paced 75-minute movies.

**In A Violent Nature** - 8/10 -This made me feel physically nauseous several times, would strongly recommend. Some of the gnarliest kills I've ever seen on the big screen. 

**A Real Pain** - 8/10

**Abigail**- 8/10 - As a French-Canadian, big shoutout to Kevin Durand for his on-point Quebecois accent. Also, ""Sammy, those are fucking onions"" was one of the best/funniest line deliveries of the year. Really entertaining gory vampire flick. Dan Stevens is straight up having a fun time this year and I'm enjoying it every time. Melissa Barrera is now competing with with Mia Goth and Samara Weaving as top Scream Queens.

**Deadpool & Wolverine** - 8/10

**Bring Them Down** - 8/10 - I love me a slow-burn family feud drama that slowly snowballs into something dark and sinister. Christopher Abbott is one of my favorite working actors today and he does incredible work here, especially with the accent/Irish/body language. Disclaimer: Not recommended to people sensitive to animal violence/cruelty. There's a lot of that.

**The Piano Lesson** - 8/10 - As far as Denzel Washington-produced, August Wilson adaptations are concerned, this is way above *Fences*. Felt less like a straight-up filmed play. The supernatural element and amazing Danielle Deadwyler performance (give her an Oscar soon pls) make this more layered and interesting. Bonus: I was sitting with/near the cast/crew for this one, 5-10 feet away from Denzel/Danielle/John David/Malcolm/Corey Hawkins/Ray Fisher/Michael Potts. Amazing experience.

**Nickel Boys** - 8/10

**Fresh Kills** - 8/10 - A really solid mob-drama told from the perspective of a mob boss' daughter, which I appreciated. It's rare you see this story from that angle. Emily Bader's scene with her dad near the end. Holy. Fucking. Shit.

**Between The Temples** - 8/10 - Carol Kane was absolutely magnetic and a joy to watch in this, and Jason Schwartzman was her perfect endearing counter. Lovely movie, that makes you want to curl up into a ball and cringe to death near to end, in a good way. The most painful-to-watch family reunion/dinner since Shiva Baby. 

**Problemista** - 8/10 - I stand with Bank of America. Julio Torres is kind of a revelation in this. His facial expressions (and hilarious run-walk thing) are perfect. Absurd, funny, and sweet comedy with so much flair and uniqueness. Some fun little details that got good laughs out of me, like Tilda's character always having her phone light on. Chaotic in all of the right ways.

**Sisterhood**	- 8/10

**Days of Happiness** - 8/10

**The Apprentice** - 8/10 - It's not breaking any new ground but Sebastian Stan is a pleasure to watch transform into Trump as the movie goes on. Grimy and gross like the streets of New York in the 80s.

**Wil** - 8/10

**Naked Ambition: Bunny Yeager** - 8/10

**Soul** - 8/10 - I didn't get to catch this during it's original run due to COVID so I'm glad it came back. My favorite Pixar movie in a little while.

**Femme** - 8/10	

**I Saw the TV Glow** - 8/10 

**Heretic** - 7/10 - A fun horror with sharp dialogue and an incredibly-hammy Hugh Grant performance.

**Emilia Perez** - 7/10 - Some amazing musical numbers, especially the opener and ""El Mal"", and Zoe Saldana has an amazing performance where she carries the entire thing (Gomez and Gascon are getting lots of praise but I didn’t see it), but it just felt like it never fully came together to reach full potential.

**Mountains** - 7/10 - A very small and warm movie about the very big and cold issue of gentrification and the real estate crisis in South Florida. Monica Sorelle is a director to watch for sure.

**Skywalkers: A Love Story** - 7/10	- Other than a few moments that seemed a bit scripted (mostly the relationship drama), this is the most thriller documentary since Free Solo.

**Ghostlight** - 7/10	

**Shoshana** - 7/10 - Israeli true-life spy-thriller, a bit Bond-like. There's a few kills in here that are insanely brutal and the explosions/gunshots catch you by surprise. It had me jump a few times.

**The Dead Don't Hurt** - 7/10- Extremely slow, don't go in expecting an action-packed Western, but Viggo has a really good eye for beautiful backgrounds and settings. Vicky Krieps is top-tier as always. This movie doesn't work without her. I like slow Westerns.

**The Fall Guy** - 7/10	

**Thelma** - 7/10	

**Twisters** - 7/10 -Natural disaster flicks just work for me. Getting to look at Daisy Edgar-Jones for 2 hours never hurts as well.

**Cuckoo** - 7/10 - Insanely impressive and physical performance from Hunter Schafer. Cool visual style and flair, but ultimately dragged down by a total clusterfuck of a plot. I was confused throughout. Hilarious German accent from Dan Stevens

**Peak Season** - 7/10	

**Kneecap** - 7/10 - Some of the funniest one-liners of the year (""Look who it is, Bone Thugz and no harmony"", ""I feel like I discovered the Beatles, if the Beatles were shit.""). The whole RRAD storyline kept it from greatness though, that was a bit too goofy for its own good.

**Wolfs** - 7/10 - I went in wanting Pitt/Clooney banter and that's exactly what I got.

**Blink Twice** - 7/10	

**My Old Ass** - 7/10	

**Better Man** - 7/10	

**Nightbitch**	- 7/10 - Your mom's favorite movie of 2024. The awful first trailer didn't do it justice, this was solid, it just doesn't get dark like you'd hope it would.

**Out of Darkness**	- 7/10 - Saw this during a Mystery Movie Monday and was pleasantly surprised. Pretty brutal, atmospheric, and violent. Some cool overhead shots and a nice score. One of the better Mystery Movies I've seen.

**We Grown Now** - 7/10	

**The End We Start From** - 7/10	

**Kinds of Kindness** - 7/10 - Not the best Yorgos but deliciously-freaky and daring filmmaking nonetheless.

**Babes** - 7/10

**Fancy Dance** - 7/10	

**MaXXXine** - 7/10 - Definitely the weakest of the trilogy but still a solid slasher with a very interesting setting. Mia Goth has great moments like in the first two.

**Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1** - 7/10 - I don't care, the montage at the end was sick. I really hope Costner gets to fund as many of these as he wants.

**Wicked - 7/10** - Pretty good, not great. Ariana Grande was the standout. There were only 2 songs that were really catchy though, wish there were more.

**Juror #2** - 7/10

**Fly Me to the Moon** - 7/10	

**The End** - 7/10 - Gorgeously-shot, super well acted, beautiful set design and production, but way too long and had no reason to be a musical. The songs were all exactly the same and pointless and there much so much time in between that you would forget it was even a musical. George MacKay kills it.

**Being Maria** - 7/10	

**Cabrini** - 7/10 - Maybe a bit overlong but honestly not bad. Surprised it's from the same director as Sound of Freedom, it's quite a step up from that. Much larger and ambitious in scope, and the lead actress was really really great. It solidly panders to its intended audience but it’s well made enough that you can just gloss over the eye-rolling moments.

**In the Land of Saints and Sinners** - 7/10 - The best Neeson action-flick in a while, so that's something. Kerry Condon as the big villain was awesome. Need more of her in stuff.

**Y2K** - 7/10 - The single-funniest death scene of the year was the skateboard scene. Laughed so hard, made my night. Audience really dug this one too, good atmosphere. Fred Durst.

**The Queen of My Dreams** - 7/10 - I was getting massive Deja Vu with The Persian Version last year. Extremely similar story and vibe, equally fun/honest/heartfelt.

**Speak No Evil** - 7/10	

**Immaculate** - 7/10 - Sydney Sweeney stepping out of her comfort zone and doing a nun-horror is cool. Long take near the end was sick.

**Gladiator II** - 7/10 - Doesn't hold a candle to the original but it was still an entertaining sandals & swords story. Fred Hechinger is so awful in this though. Man, that took me out of it. 

**Back to Black** - 7/10 - This movie is conflicting. In a vacuum, ignoring Winehouse's actual story, it's a solid music-biopic carried by a powerhouse breakthrough performance from Marisa Abela and an amazing soundtrack (obviously). On the other hand, it's a disgusting whitewash by her estate to downplay her truly awful father. The fact that he had final approval over this movie, and will financially benefit from it, is just gross and hard to ignore. The 2015 documentary does a better job telling Amy's whole story in an emotional way, and that doc made my blood boil (and is one of my favorite docs ever). 

**Coup!** - 7/10	

**The Hypnosis** - 7/10	

**The Last Stop in Yuma County** - 7/10	

**Your Monster** - 7/10

**Blitz** - 7/10 - The cartoonish villains and improbably scenarios the kid kept finding himself in took this down a notch for me. Could've been great, but it didn't quite get there. How much bad shit can happen to one kid in 24 hours? Find out with Blitz. On a technical level it had a lot going for it though.

**In the Summers** - 7/10	

**Maria** - 7/10 - Jolie kills it and it looked gorgeous but a really big step down from Jackie/Spencer for Pablo Larrain, a big 'style over substance' movie and weirdly disrespectful to Jackie Kennedy as well for some odd reason. Very weird structure.

**Lost Soulz** - 7/10

**The Girls Are Alright** - 7/10

**All We Imagine As Light** - 7/10 - With all the hype I was expecting to be blown away. It was good but kind of a let down.

**Girls Will Be Girls** - 7/10	

**Ezra** - 7/10

**Young Woman and the Sea** - 7/10 - An inspiring sports-biopic with a very old-school and authentic feel. The Remember the Titans of swimming movies. It hits all of the cliches and it's super cheesy, but in all of the right ways. It just works. Daisy Ridley was great, and as far as swimming movies are concerned, it's definitely ahead of Nyad.

**Hundreds of Beavers** - 7/10 - It's funny and original, I just wish it was a bit shorter. Some of the bits definitely outstay their welcome after a while. I really like the grassroots campaign they've built around this movie though, everything from the independent theatrical showings to the support of physical media. A great success story for indie film this year.

**The Idea of You** - 7/10	

**Crossing** - 7/10

**Sleep** - 7/10	

**Monkey Man** - 7/10 - Solid action flick for the first and third acts, but dragged down by a super boring 2nd act (where it loses all of the momentum it built) and lots of sloppy/confusing editing, especially during chase sequences. Credit for the Terrence Malick-like flashback scenes with narration/sweeping music/shots of nature/etc, pretty cool to throw those into an action movie.

**The Color Purple** - 7/10	

**The Damned** - 7/10 - You're hanging out with the soldiers on the frontier of the American Civil War and almost nothing happens for the entire runtime except you learn about the characters and their thoughts on life/god/religion/etc. I enjoyed it.

**Mean Girls**	- 7/10	

**Driving Madelaine** - 7/10	

**Late Night with the Devil** - 7/10
	
**Snack Shack** - 7/10 - Aside from the needless death at the end that tries too hard to squeeze tears out of your eyeballs, I thought this was a fun, raunchy, summer-y throwback comedy. This would've been one of my favorites in middle school probably.

**Beetlejuice Beetlejuice** - 7/10	

**Joker: Folie a Deux** - 7/10	

**The Outrun** - 7/10 - Less a compelling story and more a showcase on Saoirse Ronan's acting abilities. The camera basically doesn't move from her for a single second and she completely carries it. She's the best.

**Flow** - 7/10

**Black Box Diaries** - 7/10	

**Queer** - 7/10

**The Return** - 7/10	

**New Life** - 7/10	- I really respect a movie that can pull off a wild genre-switch halfway through the movie. Went in fully blind so it was totally unexpected. Also impressive this tiny movie could license Bob Dylan’s Like A Rolling Stone (played a few times).

**Lisa Frankenstein** - 7/10  - The ultimate ""could've been truly great with a R rating"" movie.

**Bob Marley: One Love** - 7/10 - It does just enough to keep it out of the Super Generic Biopic Genre and any movie that can squeeze a few tears out of me gets an extra point. Sorry, that's just the rules.

**Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes** - 7/10	

**1992**- 7/10 - Other than Ray Liotta being written like a ridiculous cartoon villain and some eye-rolling dialogue issues, it actually was a pretty solid crime drama... and Tyrese Gibson was…good? (/r/brandnewsentence)

**French Girl** - 7/10	

**The Peasants** - 7/10 - Visually impressive and a sick score, but a schmaltzy/melodramatic story kinda kept it from the next level.

**The Monk and the Gun** - 7/10	

**Bad Boys: Ride or Die**	- 6/10	

**Seven Blessings**	- 6/10

**Knox Goes Away** - 6/10 - Michael Keaton does his best and commits but the writing & performance of every single side character brings the whole thing down a bit. The cop/ex-wife/son characters are bumbling, distractingly-dumb goofballs that keep the plot from ever grounding to reality, but it ultimately gets dark and violent enough to stay pretty entertaining. The script really could've used some more cleaning up.

**Trap** - 6/10 - Listen I have a lot (*a lot*) of problems with this movie but Kid Cudi randomly showing up for 5 minutes and randomly delivering insane lines like ""“I specifically said i wanted honey suckle kombucha biiiiitchhhh” made the trip to the theater worth it.

**Small Things Like These** - 6/10	

**Sometimes I Think About Dying** - 6/10	

**Kidnapped**	- 6/10	

**Asphalt City** - 6/10 - Standout performance from Tye Sheridan but this leaned a bit too much into misery porn for my liking. Every single day is the absolute worst day on the job. Extremely stress-inducing first hour. Mike Tyson being cast as the medic chief was certainly a choice...and it worked somehow?

**Eden**	- 6/10 - Had trouble getting past the awful accents and the sinking feeling that this was missed potential. I was at the World Premiere for this and someone in the audience had a medical emergency, they had to pause the screening and turn the lights on while the person was carried out on people's shoulders. Jude Law/Sydney Sweeney/Ana de Armas/Ron Howard were all there wondering what was going on. Kind of a crazy situation.

**Land of Bad** - 6/10	

**Unstoppable** - 6/10	

**Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire** - 6/10 - Skull Island's bland and less impressive/memorable little brother. Thumbs up for Baby Kong and the Rio de Janeiro destruction sequence, thumbs down for the lame story and unlimited amounts of annoying human characters.

**Bad Shabbos** - 6/10	

**Inside Out 2** - 6/10	

**Firebrand** - 6/10	

**A Different Man** - 6/10 - I didn't connect to this as much as most people did. Sebastian Stan is great as usual but the whole thing didn't do much for me.

**Love Me** - 6/10 - 10/10 for the attempt, 4/10 for the execution. There's a really good movie hidden in here somewhere, but there needed to be some cuts made to the animated portions of the film for sure.

**Shell**	- 6/10

**Housekeeping for Beginners** - 6/10	

**Totem** - 6/10

**The Fire Inside** - 6/10	

**Widow Clicquot**	- 6/10 - This starts off really really really slow but then finds its footing late and ends on a solid note. Career-best performance from Haley Bennett, she really carries this.

**Tuesday** - 6/10	

**Piece by Piece** - 6/10	

**The Cut** - 6/10 - Standout turns from Orlando Bloom and Caitriona Balfe, brought down by some weird editing choices. The neon-green hallucinations were a wild choice. I sat next to Katy Perry for this movie, AMA.

**Memoir of a Snail** - 6/10

**The Romano Twins** - 6/10	

**Mufasa: The Lion King** - 6/10
	
**Film Geek** - 6/10	

**Self-Reliance** - 6/10 - Pretty cute movie with a few laughs, but the ending lost its focus and felt rushed. The Andy Samberg bits were great. I wanted more from the relationship with Anna Kendrick's character, feels like there was more to explore there. ""This an intervention."" ""For me?"" ""No, we're just all facing the wrong direction.""

**Queen of the Ring** - 6/10	

**Coup de Chance**	- 6/10 - It's nowhere near peak-Woody Allen but it's a passable return to form since Rifkin's Festival, Wonder Wheel, and A Rainy Day In New York (all 3 awful, with Rifkin's Festival being rock bottom for Allen's filmography). The one thing it was missing was humor. I can always trust an Allen film to at least have a few funny/witty lines (even the bad ones), but this was very cut and dry. Could've used a few more good lines.

**Sasquatch Sunset** - 6/10 - I was excited for the premise and there's a few sweet/funny moments, but most of it ends up being mindless shitting/pissing/fucking. Credit for the unique idea and great views.

**Bird**	- 6/10 - One of the more disappointing films of the year. Even after the lukewarm reception at Cannes, I had super high hopes because I’m a huge Andrea Arnold fan, but the surrealism in this movie just didn’t work. It threw off the whole balance and wasn’t at all what I expected/wanted. Nikiya Adams and Barry Keoghan were both very solid, and the scene where the group sang Coldplay’s Yellow to the frog was amazing.

**Omni Loop**- 6/10	

**Here**	- 6/10 - A valiant attempt but ultimately kind of a hot mess. A few good moments keep it watchable. Some real uncanny valley shit in there too though.

**Queen Rock Montreal** - 6/10	

**Turning Red** - 6/10	

**Scrambled** - 6/10	

**The Book of Clarence** -  6/10 - LaKeith Stanfield was great and committed as usual (although I don't like twin dual-roles), and James McAvoy and Cumberbatch chewing on scenery was fun, this movie had a lot of trouble figuring out what it wanted to be. I really wish it leaned more into the funny/satire and less into the serious Mel Gibson/Jim Caviezel-type biblical drama. Cool that a movie like this can be made/funded and released in theaters though.

**Booger** - 6/10	

**Irena's Vow** - 6/10 - Great story, extremely generic period drama.

**A Great Divide** - 6/10	

**Riff Raff** - 6/10 - A bit outdated and mean-spirited, this would've slapped in 2006, but Bill Murray and Pete Davidson as the incompetent mob assassins makes it worth a watch. 

**Rosalie** - 6/10

**Skincare** - 6/10	

**Yellow Bus** - 6/10
	
**Arcadian** - 6/10 - It's fine and stretches its tiny budget so its absolute limit but it's basically a Dollar Store A Quiet Place. The monster design and animation was hilariously-bad though, like an Asylum knock-off movie. I'm also now convinced that Nic Cage is contractually obligated to have his face smothered in fake blood for any movie.

**Nutcrackers** - 6/10 

**The Invisibles** - 6/10
	
**Riley** -6/10	

**Rob Peace**	- 6/10 - A well-shot movie with great direction and performance from the supporting characters (Mary J Blige and Chiwetel Ejiofor) completely dragged down by an awful lead performance by Jay Will. Also the script was a bit silly, they were trying way too hard to make him 100% infallible.

**Christmas Eve in Miller's Point** - 6/10 - I liked the hectic atmosphere of the crazy Christmas family party that we've all been at, and the very scratchy look of the camera.

**Rumours** - 6/10 - I can appreciate what Maddin was going for, and there's some moments that work (mostly with Cate Blanchett and Charles Dance, they were awesome), but overall surreal-absurd-fantasy-comedy like this just doesn't work for me.

**Fallen Fruit** - 6/10	

**Birthrite** - 6/10	

**Crumb Catcher** - 6/10	

**Anselm** - 6/10	

**Scapegoat** - 6/10	

**Seeds** - 5/10 - There’s clearly heart and maybe a great movie in here somewhere, but it’s such a tonal mess that it’s hard to find anything to love.

**Sujo** - 5/10	

**The Beekeeper** - 5/10 - This is the Rebel Moon of Jason Bourne movies. A few cool kills and classic Statham one-liners keep it from being a total loss, but it's not very good.

**Unsung Hero** - 5/10

**Jeanne du Barry**- 5/10	

**Treasure** - 5/10

**A Sacrifice** - 5/10	

**The American Society of Magical Negroes** - 5/10 - All over the place and it gave a constant feeling of ""missed opportunity"" (a la Book of Clarence). Justice Smith is straight-up not a convincing lead. An-Li Bogan was the standout, and I saw her end twist coming from a mile away so I got that going for me which is nice.

**La Syndicaliste** - 5/10

**Sonic the Hedgehog 3** - 5/10	

**The Watchers** - 5/10

**Borderlands** - 5/10 - Went in expecting a 1/10, got a 5/10. Nice. Life is all about the little wins.

**Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire** - 5/10 - Just give this franchise a permanent rest. It wasn't awful in any particular way, but it was totally soulless and heartless. It felt like nobody really gave a shit except Kumail Nanjiani. Safe, sanitized, studio slop. They couldn't even fully commit to the one interesting thing (the gay ghost love story).

**National Anthem** - 5/10	

**The 4:30 Movie**	- 5/10 - Kevin Smith jerking himself off for 80 minutes. Would make a fun double-feature with *Snack Shack* though.

**Universal Language** - 5/10 - This had a lot of hype of out Cannes and it's Canada's submission for the Oscars so I had a lot of hope, but it just didn't do much for me. Surreal-absurdism just isn't my cup of tea. The only real standout scene was the one with the Quebec democrat. A rare case of the Q&A being more interesting than the movie itself.

**Kraven the Hunter** - 5/10	

**Time Still Turns the Pages** - 5/10	

**Upgraded** - 5/10	- Basically a Great Value The Devil Wears Prada. Good as rom-com-background-nois. Marissa Tomei is awful in this. One of the worst performances of the year.

**Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot** - 5/10	

**Out of Season** - 5/10	

**Miller's Girl** - 5/10	

**Latin for All** - 5/10	

**Argylle** - 5/10 - How a movie like The Creator can be made for $80M but something so awful-looking like this needs $200M blows my mind. 

**I.S.S.** - 5/10 - I love a good sandwich-making climax as much as the next guy, but what a painfully awkward ending. The first 25 minutes made me think something decent could be happening then it derails hard and never recovers. The worst thing to happen to the space program since Challenger.

**Get Away** - 5/10	

**Brothers** - 5/10	

**Life's a Bitch** - 5/10 - France's (bad) answer to Yorgos Lanthimos. A dry, twisted, gross, weirdly-sexual, anthology film with a lot less nudity but a lot more dogs than Kinds of Kindness. Kinda loses its way comedically and becomes a chore after the first chapter.

**Azrael** - 5/10	

**Monster Summer** - 5/10 - Like a G-rated IT, with Mel Gibson for some reason (?)

**Kung Fu Panda 4** - 5/10	

**Garfield** - 5/10

V**illains, Inc** - 5/10 - It had a certain cheap charm but an overwhelming sense of ""SNL Digital Short sketch stretched way too thin"".

**Excursion** - 5/10	

**Sleeping Dogs** -  5/10

**Notice to Quit** - 5/10 - The kid actor was really good but I'm just a bit over following an extremely unlikeable lead around doing shitty things to people.

**Reunion** - 5/10

**The Boy in the Woods**	- 5/10	

**Paradise** - 5/10	

**Karaoke** - 5/10	

**It Ends With Us**	- 5/10	

**Poolman** - 4/10 - The ugly, boring,  confused lovechild of Inherent Vice and Under the Silver Lake.

**Avenue of the Giants** - 4/10	

**Arthur the King** - 4/10 - Marky Mark has really devolved as an actor honestly, really tough performance from him here. It's like he's completely forgotten how to convincingly deliver lines. Right from the GoPro scenes at the beginning I knew it was gonna be a rough time. This movie is like 85% exposition.

**Janet Planet** - 4/10 - Bookended by 2 great scenes, but filled with mostly pointless garbage.

**Dandelion**	- 4/10	

**By the Stream** - 4/10	- I enjoy Hong Sangsoo movies in very small doses. This dose was just way too big.

**Venom: The Last Dance** - 4/10	

**Red One** - 4/10	

**Oh, Canada** - 4/10 - Dreadfully confusing, and Jacob Elordi puts in one of the worst performances of the year, but at least that Phosphorescent soundtrack kept me engaged. 

**Slingshot** - 4/10	

**Adios Buenos Aires** - 4/10	

**Humane** - 4/10	

**Some Other Woman** - 4/10	

**My Daughter, My Love** - 4/10	

**Madame Web** - 4/10 - Slop.

**IF** - 4/10 - Not really for adults, not really for kids/teens. Who was this movie even for?...

**Freud's Last Session** - 4/10	

**Werewolves** - 4/10 - So much lens flare. I am now blind.

**Ramona at Midlife** - 4/10	

**The Last Front** - 4/10	

**My Penguin Friend** - 4/10
	
**Augure** - 4/10	

**Which Brings Me To You** - 4/10 - Looking back over this ranking, I'm gonna be honest and say I have no idea what this was. Don't remember. To producers out there: please stop making your movie titles random vague sentences.

**Mai** - 4/10	

**Meanwhile on Earth** - 4/10	

**Lizzie Lazarus** - 4/10	

**Or Something** - 4/10	

**The Way We Speak** - 4/10	

**Cult Killer** - 3/10 - Antonio Banderas shows up for like 5 minutes and then nopes the fuck out. Total paycheck movie.

**The Feeling that the Time for Doing Something Has Passed** - 3/10 - There were some funny lines (especially the 9/11 dating profile bit) but this was so painfully dry and slow that I could never really connect. If desert-dry, awkward, deadpan delivery, with an absurd amount of BDSM-sex-stuff thrown in is your thing, you might find a few things to like. I could not.

**Never Let Go** - 3/10	

**The Throwback** - 3/10	

**The City** - 3/10	

**Rats!**	- 3/10 - This would've worked well as an edgy Youtube short in 2012.

**The Best Christmas Pageant Ever** - 3/10	

**He Went That Way** - 3/10 - Half roadtrip comedy with a chimp, half brutal serial killer drama. Tonally all over the place. The kind of movie you'd expect Jacob Elordi to try to bury (a la Dicaprio with Don's Plum) and fire his agent over before it sees the light of way. Baffling decisions made by everyone here. 

**Megalopolis** - 2/10 - I went in expecting a mess but I was still not prepared for how bad this was. It’s Neil Breen with an unlimited budget. It felt like 6 hours. It looked so cheap and awful. A mix of Lifetime movie and a middle school play. I refuse to believe it’s bad on purpose for comedy. The only thing keeping this from a 1 is that Adam Driver/Coppola/Nathalie Emmanuel/Giancarlo Esposito were at my screening for Q&A (god bless their sweet little souls for having to seriously promote this hot mess). ""What do you think of this boner I got right here?” is a line 85 year old Jon Voight actually says in a real movie in the year of our lord 2024. My therapist will hear about this.

**A Boy Who Dreamt of Electricity** - 2/10	

**Isle of Hope** - 2/10 - Sometimes I wonder why I do this to myself.

**Chosen Family** - 1/10	- This was borderline unfinished and full-on embarrassing. The production value of a daytime soap opera mixed in with the sound editing of a local high school play. It's impressive how much filler (drone shots of surrounding neighborhood) can be squeezed into 84 minutes of movie. Sitting a few seats away from Heather Graham was a nice bonus (with Q&A), but it couldn't come close to making up for this disaster.

backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1hmtvhj,my top 10 favorite movies of 2024,"before we begin, i must emphasize that this list is 100% my own opinion and should not be taken as fact. my tastes will inevitably be different from other people. also, just because a movie isn't on this list doesn't mean i didn't like it. that's certainly a possibility but not a certainty. without further ado, let's begin.

10: didi

remember mid 90s? that comedy drama from 2018 that jonah hill directed that told the story of a child growing up in the 90s? well, didi is basically mid 90s if it was set in the late 2000s. and while it's not as good as booksmart, it's still a highly entertaining movie. for starters, this movie is fucking hilarious. most of the humor comes from the extremely witty dialogue courtesy of the script written by sean wang, who has a masterful understanding of dialogue. the film also has some solid performances with the leading performance by izzac wang being one of my favorite movie performances of the year. the film also has quite a bit of heart as well and perfectly captures that nostalgic feeling of being a child on the cusp of growing up. my only real problem with the movie is that it does meander quite a bit. but other then that, didi is a highly entertaining movie and one of the finest of the year.

9: love lies bleeding

February saw the releases of two thrillers about lesbians, drive away dolls and love lies bleeding. and of the two, love lies bleeding was easily the best one. set in 1989, love lies bleeding tells the story of a female gym manager falling in love with a female bodybuilder. if you think this is just going to be a typical lesbian romance movie, think again because this movie also has crime families and murder. and throughout the whole thing, i was in that weird position of wanting to get to the next scene to figure out where the story would go but also not wanting the movie to end. this movie is extremely suspenseful to the point where it honestly feels like a brian de palma movie. all of the characters are fully fleshed out with distinct personalities that makes it easy to either love them or love to hate them. kristen stewart and katy o brien do amazing jobs as the two female leads. but the show stealer to me is ed harris, who gives a performance that can only be described as unsettling. i also seriously need to give props to the cinematography by ben fordesman which both perfectly captures the mood of the film and also just looks really pretty. overall, love lies bleeding is sure to go down as one of the best thrillers of the 2020s, a title that it very much deserves.

8: in a violent nature

slasher movies are nothing new. as a matter of fact, in a violent nature is pretty much the typical slasher movie. however, there is a new twist to it. it's a slasher movie from the perspective of the killer. now if that isn't a head turning premise, i don't know what is. and beyond it's clever and unique premise, in a violent nature still manages to be a really solid movie. for starters, this movie is extremely pretty to look at. this movie makes excellent usage of natural lighting and natural beauty, thus making the violence that occurs stand out even more. as i previously mentioned, the movie takes place almost exclusively from the perspective of the main killer, who isn't so much a character as he is a force of nature. johnny is basically jason voorhees except with slightly more layers. he wants his locket back and he doesn't care who he has to kill in order to get it back. he's utterly terrifying but, at the same time, you can't help but feel sympathy for him. my only real problem with the movie is the long stretches of very little happening. there are several scenes depicting johnny just walking through the forest. while it's not too huge of a problem since we get to see more of the beautiful cinematography(seriously, i cannot stress enough how pretty this movie is), these scenes add very little aside from showing us how johnny got from point A to point B. other then that, in a violent nature is a very compelling watch that is sure to please both fans of slasher movies and fans of slow burn horror.

7: kingdom of the planet of the apes

when this movie was announced, i was quite skeptical since i thought that the planet of the apes reboot trilogy ended perfectly with the death of ceaser. however, while it wasn't quite as good as those movies or the 1968 original, kingdom of the planet of the apes is still a really solid movie. taking place 300 years after the death of ceaser, kingdom of the planet of the apes focuses on noa, the son of a tribe elder who's village is attacked, his father is killed, and the surviving members of his tribe are kidnapped. noa must go on a grand quest to save them, running into an orangutan priest and a human with a secret. i must say that this is easily the prettiest film in the planet of the apes series. pretty much every shot in this movie is awe inspiring to look at. and not just the CGI shots but the shots to utilize actual locations as well. speaking of CGI, the CGI is just as good as it was in the reboot trilogy. noa is also a really compelling protagonist who goes on a journey of self discovery. my only real complaints about the movie is that the villain is a bit weak, william H macy's character didn't serve much of a point beyond having a recognizable face, and noa looked at bit too similar to ceaser. otherwise, the day that you see this movie, you will stand up and proclaim ""WHAT A WONDERFUL DAY""!

6: nosferatu

when it was announced that robert eggers, one of the best directors currently working, was going to be remaking F W murnau's horror classic nosferatu, many people were very excited. and everyone who watched the teaser in june only had their excitement justified. and then, the movie actually came out and...wow! just...wow! i do not exaggerate when i say, and i'm saying this as someone who's seen longlegs, nosferatu is the best horror movie of 2024 and possibly in the top 5 of the best horror movies of the decade. the film's greatest strength is it's atmosphere. this movie perfectly captures the atmosphere of the murnau original while also offering a new experience. the cinematography is absolutely stunning and it might be egger's second best looking movie behind the lighthouse. the performances are really good espeically bill skarsgaard, lily rose depp, and willem dafoe. is it egger's best movie? hell no. the lighthouse is egger's best movie and that's how it will probably always be. nevertheless, eggers is continuing to demostrate why he is one of the great masters of horror of the 21st century and, with films like nosferatu, it's clear that he will only continue to improve as his career goes on.

5: deadpool and wolverine

saying that 2023 was a rough year for the MCU would be like saying that the titanic has some water damage. with the exceptions of guardians of the galaxy vol 3, loki season 2, and what if season 2, pretty much every MCU project that year bombed. and that's not even getting into the behind the scenes drama including but not limited to numerous projects getting delayed and jonathan major's conviction that led to him getting the boot. thankfully, 2024 seemed to be a return to form for the MCU. unlike previous years where we got at least three MCU movies, in 2024 we only got one. but holy shit! what a movie it was! this is one of the most entertaining movies of the year. like, i knew that the movie was gonna be a lot of fun going in but i could never have anticipated it being this much of a blast. deadpool and wolverine have such great chemistry as enemies turned friends and ryan reynolds and hugh jackman continue to show that they were born to play their respective roles. the film has lots of hilarious comedy to the point where i would probably consider it to be the funniest movie of the year. the film also has some really good action scenes, especially the opening fight scene which might feature the best usage of an NSYNC song in any movie. cassandra nova, despite her limited screentime, is a really good villain and is pretty much everything fans could hope for from the premise ""what if charles xavier was evil"". and then, there's the fan service. over the past couple of years, it has become common for movies based on IPs to pander to the fanbase quite a bit. deadpool and wolverine does this but in a good way. the film features the returns of actors who have not played their respective roles in years and they are just as great as they previously were. above all else, this movie is a love letter and farewell to the marvel franchises that existed before the MCU. with the MCU buying the rights to franchises that were previously out of their grasp, this movie gives the previous incarnations of these characters one final hoorah. and it is immensely satisfying. plus, the end credits feature clips and behind the scenes footage from these incarnations of the characters and it all ends with one final look at the 20th century fox logo. funny, action packed, and heartwarming, deadpool and wolverine is a crowd pleaser that helped the MCU get back on track.

4: the wild robot

dreamworks can be a bit of a mixed bag. when dreamworks is good, it's great. but when it's bad, it's horrible. one minute, they're making movies such as the prince of egypt, the first two shrek movies, spirit stallion of the cimarron, puss in boots the last wish, kung fu panda, and other solid movies. and the next, they're making crap like shrek the third, shark tale, the boss baby, and ruby gillman teenage kraken. however, i had heard some good early buzz about their latest outing, the wild robot. i even heard some people saying that it could contend for best picture. well, i saw the movie and, while i don't think it's best picture material, i'd be lying if i said that it was a bad movie. because it's not and, in fact, it might be in my top 10 favorite dreamworks movies. but even if it doesn't have that title, it's still the best animated movie of the year. while i am getting a little bit sick of all animated movies nowadays being CGI, the visuals in this movie are awe inspiring. the animation is absolutely breathtaking. the film also has great voice acting from it's all star cast. this is lupita nyongo's first animated movie and she absolutely knocked it out of the park. the film also has one of the best scores of any movie this year. i sincerely hope that kirk bowers gets a nomination for his score for this movie. also, this is a film that truly gets that film is a VISUAL medium. the film makes excellent usage of visual storytelling with several long stretches of no dialogue. the film also has a great message about found family and being more then your instincts. i do have a few problems with the movie though. while it does tackle them with new angles and the quality of the movie more then makes up for it, this is the same robot learning to love and disabled child overcoming disabilities plotline that we've seen several times before. also, the film's attempts at humor are kinda hit or miss. for every joke that works, there's one that doesn't. but hey, at least there aren't any shoehorned in pop culture references. aside from those problems, the wild robot is my favorite animated movie of the whole year. while inside out 2 seems to be the favorite for best animated feature this year, i think that the wild robot is also a worthy contender for the award as well. i'd even go so far as to say that it should also recieve a best picture nomination.

3: monkey man

when the trailer for monkey man came out, i didn't really know what to make of it. it looked very surreal and a bit off the wall. i was kind of interested by the fact that it was being written and directed by dev patel in his directorial debut. well, i decided to go see it and i was utterly blown away by how good it was. if i hadn't been told that it was made by a first time director, i would have thought that it was made by an experienced filmmaker. this movie has some of the best action i've seen on the big screen in quite some time. the true standout for me was the climatic dining room scene which kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. the acting is pretty good for the most part with the best performance coming from ashwini kalsekar as queenie. make no mistake though, the action and technical are the star of this movie. the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and, if it wasn't for the number 1 entre on the list, it would easily be the prettiest movie of the year. my only real problem with the movie is that it's a pretty cliche story. however, i am firmly of the opinion that it's better to be derivative and good then original and bad. and monkey man is most certainly good.

2: kalki 2898 AD

now, i'm going to tell you the plot for kalki 2898 AD and i need you to understand that i am not making a word of this up. in the far off future, an immortal emperor tries to make a serum that will make him all powerful and he does this by killing the unborn babies of mothers who can carry a baby to term. one of these women is said to have god growing in her womb and must escape capture with the help of another immortal person who is prophesized to save the unborn god. sounds pretty crazy right? but there is more reason to watch kalki 2898 AD then just it's crazy premise since this movie is absolutely amazing. the action is great, the music is amazing, the cinematography is gorgeous, the humor is actually funny and doesn't conflict with the tone, the characters are all interesting, and the movie is actually quite original. kalki 2898 AD is a movie that clearly wears it's influences on it's sleeve but in a good way. it takes ideas from other works and works them into something completely new. imagine my excitement when i found out that this movie was the first installment in a cinematic universe. while cinematic universes are a pretty overdone concept in a post MCU world, any excuse to get more of this is a good one. if the sequel is getting released next year, then that is my most anticipated movie of next year. that having been said, there are some pretty significant flaws with this movie. for starters, there are WWAAYY too many characters. most of them are interesting and well acted but there really doesn't need to be this many characters. it got to the point where i really didn't know who the protagonist was supposed to be. this ties into the next problem i have with this movie. way too much happens. the movie is three hours in length and it felt like i sat through an entire season of television after i saw it. i can't help but wonder if it was originally supposed to be a tv show that got reworked into a movie. also, while the pre intermission part was good(yes, this movie has an intermission), it really peaks after the intermission. the first half is not devoid of great moments because it has quite a few but you have to wait after the intermission to get to the really good stuff. and lastly, the movie just kinda...stops. it doesn't really end. it just stops. other then those problems, kalki 2898 AD is a solid action science fiction movie that managed to outdo most of the american blockbusters released during 2024. it shows that a movie doesn't need a popular IP or big name actors to be successful. all it needs is a talented director, writer, cast, and crew. if it weren't for the number 1 entree on this list, kalki 2898 AD would easily be number 1.

before we go to number 1, here are a few honorable mentions.

nightbitch: amy adams gives one of this year's finest performances as a woman on the edge of insanity in one of 2024's strangest movies. i went into this movie having never read the novel and having only watched the trailer. i didn't really know what to expect going in. but what i got was a brilliant psychological drama that mixes horror and comedy together into a perfect bow. although most of the cast gives excellent performances, let's not kid ourselves. this is amy adam's movie. after having not had the best decade and acting in numerous movies that are below her talent, adams finally gets to show off her skills in this movie. if not for the academy's notorious bias towards horror movies, adams would easily be a shoe in for at least a best actress nomination. nightbitch is a thoroughly unpredictable movie that will leave you guessing right up until the last second.

ultraman rising: while i've never been a huge ultraman fan and probably wouldn't have watched this movie if not for my father being a huge fan of the franchise, i did thoroughly enjoy ultraman rising. the animation is absolutely gorgeous. this movie is one of the best looking netflix animated movies we've gotten so far. the film also offers a new spin on the ultraman franchise, making ultraman act as a surrogate father to a baby kaiju that could rival baby yoda in terms of adorableness. i've only seen 4 of the 44 ultraman movies(holy shit! they made 44 of these damn things!) and this is, so far, my favorite.

conclave: edward berger really knocked it out of the park with 2022's all quiet on the western front. safe to say, he had a lot to live up to with his next directorial effort. well, it's safe to say that he not only lived up to the expectations that his previous movie set but actually surpassed them. this film tackles subject matter that we've never really seen before. the succession of the popehood. this is something that most people probably would never have thought to make a movie about. and thankfully, aside from the interesting premise, the film offers many more reasons to watch it. stanley tucci, john lithgow, and isabella rossellini are all at the top of their game in this movie. however, the scene stealer for me is ralph fiennes. i do not exaggerate when i say that fiennes not only gives the best performance in the movie but is also in the top 5 of my favorite movie performances of the year. throw in absolutely gorgeous cinematography and the best original musical score of the year and conclave is a movie that you will be glad you watched.

furiosa a mad max saga: the box office numbers can suck it! furiosa a mad max saga is an excellent action movie. i was thoroughly expecting this movie to make my actual list and it probably would have if not for kalki 2898 AD. nevertheless, furiosa is a thoroughly entertaining movie. while i don't like it as much as fury road, the film still has a lot going for it. the cinematography is amazing, the performances are really solid, the music is kickass, and the writing is really good. also, the film features dementus, who is second only to immortan joe as the best villain in the mad max series and is one of my favorite movie villains of the 2020s. my only real complaint with the movie is that it takes quite a while to get going. i mean, did we really need to see EVERY aspect of furiosa's childhood? other then that, furiosa is a really good movie that didn't get anywhere near the respect that it deserved.

inside out 2: when a sequel to inside out was first announced, i really didn't know what to expect going in. in my opinion, the first film was a perfectly self contained story that really didn't lend itself to sequels. however, when i saw the movie, i was absolutely astounded by how amazing it was. while i don't like it as much as the first movie, it's the best pixar sequel since toy story 3 and the best pixar movie since soul. it perfectly mixes humor and drama and is a perfect picture of teenage angst. not to mention, the film features anxiety, who is one of the best villains of the 2020s so far. i am worried that the quality of this movie will persuade pixar to focus more on sequels instead of original movies. hollywood has a history of learning the wrong lessons from successful movies. oh well, at least we got this really solid movie from it.

the bikeriders: this movie is basically goodfellas but with bikers. based on a true story, this movie tells the story of a violent biker gang. despite the characters being really shitty people, the movie does a solid job at humanizing them and making you empathize with them. tom hardy and austin butler give really good performances with hardy giving the best performance in the movie. it really is a shame that this movie is probably the closest we'll ever get to hardy acting in a quentin tarantino movie. the movie also has one of the best licensed songs soundtracks of the 2020s with an amazing mixture of songs on it. all in all, the bikeriders is a really good movie.

1: dune part 2

anyone who has read my post history probably could have seen this coming. my favorite movie of 2024 is dune part 2. as someone who loved dune part 1, my expectations were extremely high for part 2. and not only did part 2 meet those expectations, it actually managed to surpass them. pretty much everything that was great about part 1 is improved upon here. the acting, the writing, the cinematography, and the music. all the returning actors do amazing and the new actors also do good jobs. florence pugh makes the most of her brief screentime and christopher walken shows that, after all these years, he's just as talented as ever. but let's not kid ourselves. the highlight of this movie is austin butler as feyd rautha, a character who is sure to go down as one of the greatest movie villains of all time. prior to dune part 2's release, many said that, if it turned out to be successful, we will get more dune movies. well, i would call dune part 2 a success. so warner brothers, make with the other dune movies.

well folks, that's the end of the year list. here's to another great year for cinema. see you in 2025.",0,11,1735235927.0,2024-12-26 17:58:47,False
backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1hjd7dr,Lilo and Stitch should be the live-action death knell for Disney,"After seeing Dreamworks' trailer for a live action remake of their animated adaptation of How To Train Your Dragon, I'm more convinced of my earlier opinion that live-action remakes are not themselves bad but rather how the attempts are made. And I don't think this extends just to western animation.

For example, Netflix' adaptation of Cowboy Bebop is considered horrendous to most people, anime fans and non-fans alike. Meanwhile their adaptation of One Piece is considered beloved to most people. The former feels like an attempt to be realistic and weed out what made the anime charming, while the latter feels like it leans into the weirdness and nonsensicalness of it. This latter sentiment is also why some live-action adaptations in Japan succeed (Gintama, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure) while others don't (Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan).

To me at least, it feels not that live-action adaptations or remakes are destined to fail, but rather it depends on how they're adapted in the first place. Disney developed the Inspector Gadget movie which is critically panned by most people, but actually watching it is a fun endeavour in the sense of a ""hate-watch"" experience. Compare that with The Lion King or Mulan where, for some people, it just hurts to even sit through because they're not only devoid of charm but they're devoid of any uniqueness that might substitute that.

With the adaptation of How To Train Your Dragon coming up, and just how positively it was received for the most part (some fears understandably still linger), the film might do for live-action adaptations what the Sonic movie did for video game movies. And with the Lilo and Stitch adaptation coming up, I think this should be Disney's final attempt at a style of film they've never really understood in over 40 years.

The film has me hopeful for a few key reasons:

* a few of the original film's cast is returning; Chris Sanders as Stitch, Amy Hill as Tutu (originally Mrs Hasagawa), Tia Carrere as Mrs Kekoa (originally Nani), Jason Scott Lee as the manager of Nani's workplace (originally David)
* the director and creator of the original screenplay is returning both as Stitch and as an advisor
* this was one of the first adaptations to enter production and has spent the longest in pre-production
* the CGI for Stitch in the teasers actually looks good compared to what we've seen for the other adaptations; not too rushed, not too realistic

**TLDR**

What I'm trying to say is, I am not going into this film with blind faith that it will be a success. But I'm more hopeful than the previous attempts and if it flops despite having returning cast members, the original creator as an advisor, and spending longer in development than any of the other films, then I think it's time for Disney to bail out.",0,11,1734798209.0,2024-12-21 16:23:29,False
backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1hcvfm7,Favorite lesser known one-liners,"I got one stuck in my head today and started thinking about the less appreciated one-liners in film history.

To say that it was a great Thanksgiving weekend would be selling it short.

***Moana 2*** surpassed every expectation and delivered a record-breaking debut for the Thanksgiving weekend. And with the aid of ***Wicked*** and ***Gladiator II***, it was the busiest weekend of the year.

The Top 10 earned a combined $269.2 million this weekend ($412.8 million five-day). That's not just a colossal 210% up from last year, but it's also the biggest Thanksgiving weekend ever.

Debuting on top, ***Moana 2*** earned a colossal $139.7 million in 4,200 theaters. Adding its numbers from Wednesday, the debut rises to $225.4 million in five days. It broke so many records, including the biggest debut for a Walt Disney Animation Studios film debut, as well as the highest Thanksgiving weekend. But most importantly; it beat ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** ($204.6 million) for the biggest Wednesday-to-Sunday debut. 

A fantastic debut all around, and it shouldn't be a surprise. If you've followed the Top 10 charts on streaming, you'll find that ***Moana*** has been one of the most streamed films in the past years. It was even reported that it was the most streamed film across all services last year. Needless to say, ***Moana*** became far more popular with years, and audiences hoped for a sequel to come.

Disney, for some reason, was interested in doing it but only as a TV show for Disney+. In February 2024, it was revealed that the show was retooled into a film that would hit theaters this Thanksgiving. With an extensive marketing campaign, Disney successfully got people into giving this film a chance. 

According to Disney, 65% of the audience was female, and 60% was 18 and over. Critics were not enthused with the film, and it currently sits at 64% on RT. The audience was more forgiving, giving it an ""A–"" on CinemaScore, although that falls on the lower end of WDAS titles. There are no animated titles on its way until ***Dog Man*** in January, so it can leg out through the holidays. $500 million is pretty much guaranteed, and can go as high as $600 million if it can hold very well.

After defying gravity on its opening weekend, ***Wicked*** continued flying high. It earned $81.1 million this weekend ($118.2 million five-day). That marks an insane 28% drop, which breaks the record set by ***Top Gun: Maverick*** (29%) as the smallest drop for a $100+ million opener. Of course, ***Maverick*** achieved that record on the weekend after Memorial Day, but it didn't face a $100+ million opener on its second weekend.

Through ten days, ***Wicked*** has earned a colossal $263.1 million domestically. It's already the highest grossing Broadway musical adaptation, passing ***Grease*** ($188 million). Of course, ***Grease*** is still ahead in terms of adjusted inflation ($770 million), but ***Wicked*** remains a colossal success. It should hit $400 million without any problem, and the holidays can help it get close to $500 million by the end of its run.

Paramount's ***Gladiator II*** added $31 million this weekend. That represents a 44% drop, which is fine, but not fantastic considering how well the other holdovers did. Through 10 days, Ridley Scott's sequel has earned $111.4 million, passing ***Robin Hood*** and ***Black Hawk Down*** to become Scott's 6th highest grossing film domestically. The film should finish with over $150 million domestically, quite down from the original's $187 million lifetime gross.

After a steep second weekend drop, Amazon MGM's ***Red One*** eased a light 4%, adding $12.7 million this weekend. The film has earned $75.8 million so far, and depending on next week's drop, it could still hit $100 million. Although it's hard to call this a bonafide hit considering its colossal $250 million budget.

Lionsgate's ***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** was still on the Top 5, easing just 6% and adding $3.2 million. The film has earned $31.9 million domestically.

In sixth place, Angel Studios' ***Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin*** fell 54% and added $2.3 million this weekend ($3.3 million five-day). That's a very weak drop, especially considering it had Thanksgiving. Through ten days, the film has amassed $9.6 million and will close with less than $15 million.

***Venom: The Last Dance*** is still holding well, dipping 43% this weekend and adding $2.2 million. The film has amassed $137.8 million so far, which is still far behind the previous ***Venom*** films.

A24's ***Heretic*** continues falling. This weekend, it fell 57% and added $956K this weekend. With $26.8 million in the bank, it's now gonna finish below $30 million.

In the face of ***Moana 2***, DreamWorks' ***The Wild Robot*** had its worst drop yet. It collapsed 67% this weekend, adding $700,000 to its run. The film has earned $142.5 million, and it's nearing the end of its run.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Searchlight's ***A Real Pain***, which recovered after its weak drop last weekend. The film dipped 39%, grossing $655,910 this weekend. The film has earned just $6.1 million, and barring some huge Oscar noms, it looks like it might miss $10 million.

Outside the Top 10 was Focus Features' ***Conclave***, which dipped 46% and earned $616,955 this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $30.1 million domestically. A damn great run for an adult drama.

Neon's ***Anora*** is winding down, and it's now playing in just 230 theaters. This weekend, it dipped 43% and added $385,292. Its domestic total stands at $12.7 million.

A24 debuted Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer*** in 7 theaters, earning $188,808. That translates to a $26,973 per-theater average, which is quite middling (it barely cracks the top 20 highest PTA of the year). For comparison, it's barely above ***Bones and All*** ($24,201), and far below ***Suspiria*** ($92,019) and ***Call Me By Your Name*** ($103,233). The film will continue expanding through the holidays.

#**OVERSEAS**

The records don't stop just in America for ***Moana 2***.

***Moana 2*** debuted with a colossal $163 million overseas, which means it debuted with $389.2 million worldwide. That broke ***Mario***'s record ($377 million) for the biggest animated debut in history. The biggest markets were France ($18.8M), UK ($15.5M), Mexico ($11.1M), Germany ($10.5M), Italy ($9.3M), South Korea ($9.1M), Australia ($8.3M), Brazil ($7.5M), China ($6.5M) and Spain ($5.5M). An easy billion right here, ladies and gentlemen. 

***Wicked*** is a monster hit domestically, but that popularity hasn't fully connected with the rest of the world. This weekend, the film earned $29 million from the overseas markets, taking the worldwide total to $360.3 million. It's still killing it in the UK ($36M) and Australia ($12.9M), and it has performed well in South Korea ($8.5M), Mexico ($6.7M), and Philippines ($3.5M). The rest of the markets... not so much. While it still has some markets left, the film will be domestic-heavy. The film is cleary a hit, but it's crazy how the domestic market represents a huge 73% of its worldwide gross.

***Gladiator II*** added $27.2 million this weekend, and its worldwide total is now $320.2 million. The best markets are the UK ($29.7M), France ($22.5M), Spain ($15M), Mexico ($12.9M) and Australia ($11.5M). The film should pass the original's $272 million foreign gross, but it's unlikely it can pass its worldwide gross ($460 million).

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Beetlejuice Beetlejuice* | Sep/6 | Warner Bros. | $111,003,345 | $294,100,435 | $450,053,961 | $100M
*Saturday Night* | Sep/27 | Sony | $3,400,583 | $9,509,312 | $9,752,378 | $25M
*Terrifier 3* | Oct/11 | Cineverse | $18,928,113 | $53,981,071 | $94,436,616 | $2M

- 36 years in the making and it paid off, as ***Beetlejuice Beetlejuice*** closed with a fantastic $294 million domestically, finishing as Burton's second highest grossing film, just a little behind ***Alice in Wonderland*** ($334 million). Interestingly, that popularity wasn't as strong overseas, as the domestic market represented 65.3% of its worldwide gross. It's still a great $450 million worldwide, although ***Alice*** ($1 billion) and ***Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*** ($474 million) finished far higher. Despite a few duds here and there, Tim Burton is still as popular as he's ever been.

- ***Saturday Night Live*** might be popular 50 years later, but that doesn't mean the audience is interested in a film depicting its first ever broadcast. That was the case for Jason Reitman's ***Saturday Night***, which closed with a very poor $9.5 million domestically. The film was positioned as an Oscars contender, but the film fizzled out by the time it hit wide release and faded quickly. Don't expect the rest of the world to save it, given that ***Saturday Night Live*** isn't as popular as the States. 

- Last month, we had two movies revolving around a clown as its protagonist. ***Joker: Folie à Deux*** became one of the worst received comic book films of all time, allowing Art the Clown to emerge as the winner of the month. And now, ***Terrifier 3*** has closed with a damn fantastic $94 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing unrated film ever. Shattered the ceilling of what a film like this could achieve, and elevating Art to one of the most iconic horror villains of modern times. Damien Leone has already confirmed a fourth film is coming up. Art in space when?

#**THIS WEEKEND**

The post-Thanksgiving weekend is usually a dumping ground for studios. With the Christmas season kicking off, people are busy, which is why studios avoid releasing anything big. It's up to the small films to get a chance. This weekend, we have two newcomers and none of them stand a chance in dethroning ***Moana 2***. None will even touch $10 million this weekend.

The only one with a confirmed wide release is A24's ***Y2K***, which marks Kyle Mooney's debut as writer and director. The film stars Jaeden Martell, Julian Dennison, Rachel Zegler, Fred Durst, and Alicia Silverstone, and depicts an imaginative version of the Year 2000 problem, where a bug causes all technology to come to life and turn against humanity. The film has received mixed reviews (63% on RT), and horror comedies have not performed well as of late. We'll see how it does, but a debut under A24's ***Heretic*** ($10.8 million) seems pretty much imminent.

The other film, although in far less theaters, is Searchlight's ***Nightbitch***. A film that stars Amy Adams as a mother who transforms into a dog. Like, seriously. Y'all complain about lack of originality in Hollywood? Well, here's a very unique premise. Reviews are quite similar to ***Y2K***, and marketing has been very limited so far. This suggests it won't be a very wide release.

And for those curious, Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** is returning to theaters this Friday for a limited time on IMAX screens. You should hurry up, for screenings are quickly getting sold out.

But this isn't about that movie. That movie is relevant because it included an exchange between a hardcore comic fan discussing with a very very very bored Ben Affleck the characters [Blunt-man and Chronic](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fqr0y4zh7uzbb1.gif&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=8c0bfa284be8f8824a13b40a5575dd70ed6c8012f1930fc04904a531add79ca7&ipo=images):

I'd say most of the humor holds up amazingly well even to this day. The stuff that seems to stick out the most/aged the worst is the 4th wall camera break stuff, but these aren't super common.

Honestly, go watch Chasing Amy. If she had Renee Zellweger's brand name she would have been nominated for a damn Oscar.
* I feel Kevin Smith, in general, doesn't get enough credit for these first 5 movies. I know he has an outsized personality and presence now compared to most of these movies, but don't let that color your perceptions of these movies. They are just hilarious movies.

This is my favorite thing she's ever done. And probably had an outsized impact on my taste in women. I appreciate when a chick will just say ""Get your shit together you fucking dumbass.""
* Also, I made it this entire time without even mentioning Dogma. Unfortunately, I would get entirely sidetracked by that movie. It's fucking awesome. But, unless you break the law you can't even watch it. Though, I think that's about to change due to Harvey Weinstein being a piece of shit. But with less money than before.

All that being Said, Kevin Smith is like The Farrelly Brothers meets Wes Anderson.

backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1f7ymza,vice is actually a good movie.,"in 2018, adam mckay followed up the surprise success of the big short with vice, a dark comedy biopic about dick cheney. the film was overall well recieved by critics and went onto be nominated for eight academy awards, winning one for best hairstyle and makeup. however, the film has also recieved a fair amount of criticism for it's liberal agenda and it's large amount of historical license.

i saw the film in theaters when i was in high school and have seen it twice since. and i really do think that it's a solid movie.

let's start with the one thing that everyone can agree is good about this movie. the performances. christian bale is spectacular as dick cheney. not only does he gets his voice and mannerisms down but he actually looks quite a bit like him. to this day, i am very upset that he lost best actor to rami malek. but he doesn't give the only good performance in the movie. amy adams as lynne cheney, steve carrell as donald rumsfeld, sam rockwell as george W bush, and tyler perry as colin powell all turn in some of their finest performances.

like the big short, the editing in this movie is very well done. say what you will about adam mckay's more recent output but you cannot deny that the editing is amazing. i feel that it particularly stands out in the scene where cheney and bush are discussing cheney being vice president. the scene is constantly crossed with cheney fly fishing. sure, the metaphor isn't exactly subtle but it's still pretty clever.

this movie is easily the funniest movie of 2018. this movie gave me some of the hardest laughs i had had in theaters up to that point. from the fake out closing credits in the middle of the movie to cheney telling bush that he would be willing to take care of some minor duties...and then proceeds to list off the duties of the president.

dick cheney is not a good person and the movie clearly demonstrates that. however, the film is actually a very layered protrayal of the man. he's not some mustache twirling psychopath. the movie shows that he actually has moments of humanity. one of the standout scenes for me is the scene where mary comes out of the closest. after a brief moment of silence, dick hugs mary and tells her that he and lynne love her no matter what. for a movie with a supposed liberal bias, the film actually does a pretty good job at portraying dick cheney in a very human light.

like the big short, the film does a very good job at showing people a part of american history that not a lot of them know about. despite the lasting impact that his actions had, not many people know who dick cheney is. this movies brings his actions to the forefront.

the film has one of the best plot twists in any movie ever. i don't dare spoil it but please watch the movie.

the film certainly isn't flawless by any stretch of the imagination. the film does take a while to get going and it does jump around time a lot. and as much as i've praised the acting, lily rabe is only so so as liz cheney. come on girl, you were really good in american horror story. the film also hasn't aged the best given that liz cheney has retracted her feelings against gay marriage.

now, if you don't like the movie, that's perfectly fine. this is just my own personal opinion and i can certainly understand why someone wouldn't like it. however, i really like it in spite of whatever flaws it may have. it's a well constructed movie that left me thoroughly engaged from beginning to end. i have recommended this movie to many people and everyone i know who has seen it loved or at least liked it.",99,92,1725366469.0,2024-09-03 13:27:49,False
backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1ex3blh,Top 5 Blue Sky Studios Movies,"I miss Blue Sky Studios so much, so I decided to make a list of the top 5 best movies made by the studio.

5. *Rio* (2011)

Fun movie with catchy songs and beautiful animation. My favorite character was definitely the toucan played by George Lopez and the scene where he sang and kissed his mate was so cute. *Rio 2* sadly doesn't compare to the first one.

4. *Spies in Disguise* (2019)

Way better than the advertising made it look. The two leads are entertaining, the animation is decent, and the villain was way more memorable and menacing than I thought he'd be. Seriously, Killian is an awesome antagonist and one of the coolest animated foes in recent years. Not bad for the studio's last feature film. Highly recommend you see it if you haven't already.

3. *Robots* (2005)

This movie is so overlooked, its criminal. You have an incredibly creative art style mixed in with talent like Robin Williams, Mel Brooks, and Ewan McGregor. Plus, despite having some crude humor, several jokes will still leave you in stitches, I guarantee it. If any film deserved a follow up, it was this one.

2. *Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs* (2009)

You wouldn't expect the third Ice Age movie to be enjoyable, but this marvelous film proved everyone wrong. It's funny, it has likable new characters, the ending cover of ""Walk The Dinosaur"" by Queen Latifah is a GODSEND, and it actually has a lot of heart to it. I really wish the series ended here because it's a surprisingly solid flick that no one had any faith in, myself included. *Ice Age: The Meltdown* isn't bad, either, but I have such a great time watching the third film over and over again.

1. *Horton Hears a Who!* (2008)

The best Seuss adaptation to date. It's not even close. It's extremely funny, has appealing animation, and most of all, it gets the message of the book right. It would've been so easy to make it a soulless cash grab like the 2018 Grinch movie, but the makers actually did their homework and made sure this film didn't stray from the book's message. Sadly, I think most people only know this film because of the mayor's son JoJo, a young emo because emos/goths were everywhere in animation back then. But even knowing this, JoJo is still a likable character who goes through his own arc. And that's one of the major draws of this movie: the cast. Jim Carrey and Steve Carrell have amazing chemistry here and provide some of the film's biggest laughs. But there's also Seth Rogen (before he was a sellout), Will Arnett, Carol Burnett, Amy Poehler, Isla Fisher, and more. So much talent in this one animated Seuss movie and it shows. Blue Sky is still the only studio to make a good Seuss adaptation and I will forever respect it for that. *Green Eggs and Ham* on Netflix came close, but even that pales in comparison to this wonderful movie.",2,11,1724179042.0,2024-08-20 19:37:22,False
backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1ewslbt,About the events of THAT day in the movie Doubt (2008),"I just watched it because it's Amy Adams' birthday, and it’s a very good movie. I absolutely loved the performances from the entire cast. I came straight to Reddit to check the fan theories about Father Flynn.

While many of the well-known theories make sense, one aspect that is bugging me are the events of that particular day.

According to Flynn, he was called into the rectory because McGuinn had seen him drink wine, but Sister James never noticed any strange behavior or detected any smell of alcohol on him before he left for the rectory.

So at worst, something might have happened after Donald went to the rectory. Or at best, Flynn is lying about why Donald was called into the rectory. What are your thoughts?

Also, in the scene after the altar service, you can see Donald sitting on the stairs with his T-shirt still on, so Flynn’s explanation for Donald leaving his T-shirt behind doesn’t make sense either.",8,40,1724151578.0,2024-08-20 11:59:38,False
backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1ewkk11,"About ""Her"" with Joaquin Phoenix (SPOILERS)","I love this movie and think it says many things. There is the question of sentience, the incompatibility of humans and hyper-intelligent beings, the progress that failed relationships bring you, and much more. But today, I want to talk about the power of friendship.

Theodore and Amy's friendship, to me, is the most powerful thread of this movie. Their connection survived a brief romance, depressions, work challenges, two divorces, two other relationships, and whatever may have happened off-screen. In fact, those struggles strengthened it.

They support each other, even when a life partner doesn't.

In the final scene, a kiss between Theodore and Amy would be an alluring path for many writers, but Spike Jonze stayed true to what they are — bonafide homies. 

The movie constantly doses you with loneliness and fleeting connection, but gives you safety and reprieve during the Theo/Amy scenes. And at the end, it delivers the same triple-fold. They are most of what each other has.

There is nothing that will carry you forward, and reassure you that everything will be okay, like a friend. Go forth today and thank a homie, if you are lucky enough to have one.",20,3,1724121381.0,2024-08-20 03:36:21,False
backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1eobyaw,Does anyone know who this actress is??,"The movie is ""THE FIRST OMEN""   
Here's the link of the scene [https://imgur.com/a/BZHy7JD](https://imgur.com/a/BZHy7JD)  
and this scene happens at the start, just a few minutes in. I have gone through the credits but there's no mention of her anywhere. I just wanna find out because at first after watching the movie I was like ""damn shes hot"" whoever she is and then forgot about it. However, after rewatching it today, my curiosity got the better of me, and I can't figure out why she isn't listed in the credits lol.  
Anyway I found some actresses online who were part of the supporting cast, but none of them seem to match her imo.   
1. marial bajma riva  
2. milena bozic  
3. Amy Clayton  
4. amalia strand

backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1ektvws,Here's a weird movie marathon that you could theoretically connect together,"Here's the list of movies without telling you the spoilers to them and how I connect them in my own little head canon






The life aquatic with Steve Sizzou








Lost in translation







Lucy







Her








Beau is afraid









The only caveat to this is that each character in each movies have different names, but the same actors and this would only work if they maintained the same names between movies







****** everything Past this point may contain spoilers for the aforementioned 5 movies********








First you start with 







The Life Aquatic with Steve Sizzou








Bill Murray had a beautiful and weird journey and the movie ends happily even knowing that his wife cheats on him







The second movie








Lost in translation







In this movie Bill Murray as a washed up actor (like at the end of Steve Sizzou) travels to Japan and meets a young Scarlett johansson even though they never get together








Third movie






Lucy








Scarlett johanssons character moves to Taiwan where the movie Lucy takes place intergrating her into technology becoming an AI







Fourth movie







Her






Joaquin Phoenix falls in love with the ai played by Scarlett johansson and at the end of the movie we see him fall for Amy








Fifth movie







Beau is afraid






This is where you have to suspend some belief that Joaquin Phoenix character always wanted to be sexual in her but never actually came or did anything past masturbation in her, because he does masturbate, but also after the ending of her Amy dies in some brutal fashion that Joaquin Phoenix becomes extremely anxious and depressed and paranoid for beau is afraid where the movie continues all the way to the end.

backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1ektc1t,The Amy Winehouse 2015 doc,"It was heart breaking to hear how upset over and codependent she became with Blake who completely destroyed and used her for his own selfish gain. 

Mitch unironically treats Amy quite similar to how Blake treats her. Mitch admits he was a coward at the beginning of the documentary. He says he thought ‘Amy was over it (the abandonment) pretty quick.’ To that I say, speak for yourself Mitch, take some responsibility.

Her lyrics hit so deep for me compared to any other artist. As a person with borderline personality disorder (bpd), Amy reminds me so much of myself. My bpd mom is a fan of hers as well. Not quite sure if Amy is bpd or not and I’m not here to assess whether she is but I do find her personality to be relatable to my own. 

As a documentary, I thought it was well done. They encapsulated the overall essence of who Amy really was and what she went through. It was how a documentary should be; not over produced. I haven’t seen a good documentary that really hit me in the feels for a long time. 

Thank you to all of you who recommended the 2015 documentary over the new 2024 movie. I heard about the disaproval regarding the new 2024 movie and decided not to waste my time.

backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1dpczzi,Female Characters: The Conversation (1974),"I just rewatched Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece ""The Conversation"".

I'd like to share a little thought about the movie, given that everything else about it (screenplay, Gene Hackman's performance, soundtrack) has already been glorified as it should.

Despite being a 50 years old movie, very much focused on his male protagonist, and besides the presence of icons like John Cazale and Harrison Ford in supporting male roles, I really enjoyed the female characters.

- Mild Spoilers - 

Cindy Williams's Ann, alongside her partner in scene Frederic Forrest, is such a central and enigmatic force in the movie. Her ""Conversation"" moves the threads of the movie, the obsessive repetition of their speech and her walk with her lover, that we as spectators can observe more and more clearly as the movie goes by, is a focal point for the plot. Her innocent and smart beautiful face haunts the protagonist, who becomes obsessed by the thought of save her, and the dream sequence is very clear about that. The ending plot twist throw a completely different shade on her character, and the public has to rewind all the 2 hours movie in its mind to re-read the truth.

Elizabeth MacRae's Meredith is so underrated! She is a perfect femme fatale, sexy and clumsy at the same time, and I like the peculiar way she has to move in the space. In the unsettling party scene, she does a little dance on her own while talking with Harry, she runs after the motorbike as they are interrupted, she laughs and dance again. She's the only one, in the whole movie, capable of opening a small glimmer of light in the protagonist. She is calming and direct while undress herself and Harry, who will be betrayed after a rare moment of abandon. A very detailed prossemic interpretation for a villain double-crosser, worthy of the best Bond Girls.

Teri Garr's Amy, with her only scene leaves a mark with her naive energy, her questioning at Harry, which puts him in serious difficulty, the purity of the affection she seems to show him and the bitterness of realizing that our protagonist is not ready to be loved.

That's all, ""The Conversation"" is often remembered as a One Man Show movie, but I think the supporting cast and characters are really worth the watching too :)",5,2,1719444978.0,2024-06-27 00:36:18,False
backtoblack,amy winehouse movie,1dn199n,Top 5 psychological thrillers I think you should watch.,"My top 5 psychological thrillers

If you’re a fan of psychological thrillers that will keep you on the edge of your seat, I’ve got some great recommendations for you. Psychological thrillers are all about exploring the darker, more complex aspects of the human mind, often featuring unreliable narrators, intense plot twists, and mind-bending scenarios. Here are my top five picks:

1: [Midsommar](https://amzn.to/3XCeEBT) 
2: [Gone Girl](https://amzn.to/4cwmUYz) 
3: [Silence of the Lambs](https://amzn.to/3zh435t) 
4: [The Woman in the Window](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062678426/ref=cm_sw_r_as_gl_api_gl_i_H5TDF6EDR58MDXTMHTBG?linkCode=ml2&tag=heatgolf0d-20) 
5: [The Butterfly Effect](https://amzn.to/3KWnzqw) 

1. Midsommar
Directed by Ari Aster, “Midsommar” is a disturbing and visually stunning thriller that delves into the horrors lurking beneath a seemingly idyllic Swedish festival. The film’s slow-burn approach builds an unsettling atmosphere, and its psychological impact is profound. It’s not just a horror movie; it’s a deeply unsettling exploration of grief and psychological manipulation.

2. Gone Girl
David Fincher’s adaptation of Gillian Flynn’s novel is a masterclass in suspense and psychological intrigue. When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) disappears, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect. The film’s exploration of media influence, deceit, and the dark complexities of marriage keeps you guessing until the very end. The twists are shocking and the narrative is compellingly dark.

3. Silence of the Lambs
This classic thriller directed by Jonathan Demme features one of the most iconic villains in film history, Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) must engage with Lecter to catch another serial killer, Buffalo Bill. The psychological cat-and-mouse game between Clarice and Lecter is intense and gripping, making it a staple of the genre.

4. The Woman in the Window
Based on the bestselling novel by A.J. Finn, this film follows an agoraphobic woman (Amy Adams) who believes she has witnessed a crime in her neighbor’s house. The narrative is filled with twists and turns, as her perception of reality is constantly questioned. The film effectively captures the essence of psychological thrillers by blurring the lines between what’s real and what’s imagined.

5. The Butterfly Effect
This sci-fi thriller starring Ashton Kutcher explores the concept of chaos theory and how small changes can have dramatic consequences. The protagonist discovers he can travel back in time and alter events, but each change has unforeseen and often devastating effects on his present life. The film’s exploration of memory, trauma, and the far-reaching impact of our choices makes it a thought-provoking psychological thriller.

These films are prime examples of psychological thrillers because they delve deep into the human psyche, challenging viewers’ perceptions and keeping them on the edge of their seats with intricate plots and intense emotional depth. If you’re looking for movies that will truly mess with your mind, give these a watch.

What are your favorite psychological thrillers? I’d love to hear your recommendations!
