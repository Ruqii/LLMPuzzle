[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/02/dune-part-two-review-denis-villeneuve-spectacular-sequel-timothee-chalomet-rebecca-ferguson-1235832727/):

>To be fair to Villeneuve, it was never a given that there’d be a thirst for this franchise in the first place, and audiences went into *Part One* not knowing that they’d want a *Part Two* just as soon as it finished. *Part Two* would be an epic achievement from any other director, but it feels that there is something bigger, better and obviously more *decisive* to come in the third and hopefully final part of the trilogy. “This isn’t over yet!” says Chani, and if anyone can tie up this strange, sprawling story and take it out with a bang, Villeneuve can.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/dune-part-two-review-timothee-chalamet-zendaya-1235830061/):

>Running close to three hours, *Dune: Part Two* moves with a similar nimbleness to Paul and Chani’s sandwalk through the open desert. The narrative is propulsive and relatively easy to follow, Hans Zimmer’s score is enveloping, and Greig Fraser’s cinematography offers breathtaking perspectives that deepen our understanding of the fervently sought-after planet. All these elements make the sequel as much of a cinematic event as the first movie.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/dune-2-review-timothee-chalamet-denis-villeneuve-1235917934/) (80/100):

>Villeneuve treats each shot as if it could be a painting. Every design choice seems handed down through millennia of alternative human history, from arcane hieroglyphics to a slew of creative masks and veils meant to conceal the faces of those manipulating the levers of power, nearly all of them women.

[Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/dune-part-two-review-1234962710/) (90/100):

>The French-Canadian filmmaker has delivered an expansion and a deepening of the world built off of Herbert’s prose, a YA romance blown up to Biblical-epic proportions, a Shakespearean tragedy about power and corruption, and a visually sumptuous second act that makes its impressive, immersive predecessor look like a mere proof-of-concept. Villeneuve has outdone himself.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/dune-2-review-timothee-chalamet-zendaya/) (75/100):

>For those already invested in the “Dune” franchise, “Dune: Part Two” is a sweeping and engaging continuation that will make you eager for a third installment. And if you were a fence-sitter on the first, this should also hold your attention with a taut, well-done script and engaging characters with whom you’ll want to spend nearly three hours.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/dune-part-two-movie-review-1234955419/) (C):

>The pieces on this chess board are so big that we can hardly even tell when they’re moving, and while that sensation helps to articulate the sheer inertia of Paul’s destiny, it also leads to a shrug of an ending that suggests Villeneuve and his protagonist are equally at the mercy of their epic visions. No filmmaker is better equipped to capture the full sweep of this saga (which is why, despite being disappointed twice over, I still can’t help but look forward to “Dune: Messiah”), and — sometimes for better, but usually for worse — no filmmaker is so capable of reflecting how Paul might lose his perspective amid the power and the resources that have been placed at his disposal.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1522684/dune-part-two-review/) (7/10):

>Perhaps viewing the first ""Dune"" and ""Dune: Part Two"" back-to-back is the best solution, but I suspect most people aren't going to do that — they're going to see a new movie. And what they'll get is half of one. Maybe that won't matter, though. Perhaps audiences will be so wowed by that final act that they'll come away from ""Dune: Part Two"" appropriately stunned. And maybe whenever Villeneuve returns to this world — and it sure seems like he wants to — he can finally find a way to tell a complete story.

[Inverse](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/dune-2-review):

>“In so many futures, our enemies prevail. But I do see a way. There is a narrow way through,” Paul tells his mother at one point in the film. Like Paul’s vision of the future, there were many ways for *Dune: Part Two* to fail. But not only does it succeed, it surpasses the mythic tragedy of the first film and turns a complicated, strange sci-fi story into a rousing blockbuster adventure. *Dune: Part Two* isn’t a miracle, per se. But it’s nothing short of miraculous.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/movies/dune-part-two) (8/10):

>Dune: Part Two expands the legend of Paul Atreides in spectacular fashion, and the war for Arrakis is an arresting, mystical ride at nearly every turn. Denis Villeneuve fully trusts his audience to buy into Dune’s increasingly dense mythology, constructing Part Two as an assault on the senses that succeeds in turning a sprawling saga into an easily digestible, dazzling epic. Though the deep world-building sometimes comes at the cost of fleshing out newer characters, the totality of Dune: Part Two’s transportive power is undeniable.

[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/dune-part-two-review-zendaya-timothee-chalamet-b2499855.html) (100/100):

>Part Two is as grand as it is intimate, and while Hans Zimmer’s score once again blasts your eardrums into submission, and the theatre seats rumble with every cresting sand worm, it’s the choice moments of silence that really leave their mark.

[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/dune-part-two-review/) (5/5):

>The climax here is sharply judged, sustaining what worked on page while making the outcome more discomforting. It’s a finale that might throw off anyone unfamiliar with Herbert, or anyone expecting conventional pay-offs. But it does answer the story’s themes and, tantalizingly, leave room for more. Could Herbert’s trippy Dune Messiah be adapted next, as teased? Tall order, that. But on the strength of this extravagantly, rigorously realized vision, make no mistake: Villeneuve is the man to see a way through that delirious desert storm.

[Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/e/23842690) (93/100):

>Dune: Part Two is exactly the movie Part One promised it could be, the rare sequel that not only outdoes its predecessor, but improves it in retrospect… One of the best blockbusters of the century so far.

[Screenrant](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dune-part-two/https//screenrant.com/dune-part-2-movie-review/) (90/100):

>Dune: Part Two is an awe-inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi spectacle and a devastating collision of myth and destiny on a galactic scale.

[RogerEbert.com](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dune-part-two-movie-review-2024) (88/100):

>Dune: Part Two is a robust piece of filmmaking, a reminder that this kind of broad-scale blockbuster can be done with artistry and flair.

dune2,dune sequel,1ak96by,does anyone on this sub suspect what their favorite movie of the year is going to be?,"although 2024 is still pretty young, there are a lot of really cool sounding movies that are slated to come out this year. does anyone have an idea of what their favorite movie of the year is going to be? or maybe, you've already seen the movie that you believe will be it. 

for me, i already suspect that it's gonna be dune part 2. i loved the first movie, to the point where it's actually in my top 10 favorite movies of all time, and i can't wait for the sequel. adding in the fact that everyone is praising it with christopher nolan even calling it the empire strikes back of this generation.",0,46,1707224373.0,2024-02-06 12:59:33,True

dune2,dune sequel,18zrws2,New movies that set up plot that the sequels totally abandon.,"This is one of my least favorite trends in modern movies. The one that sticks out in my mind the most is IT and IT: Part Two. Friendships and relationships are set up in the first film and engage the audience, and then whoops, sorry. We focus grouped and decided to cut it to make more time for what we think people want to see the  most. It's so dumb because you can tell the studio is hoping that people won't notice. It feels very desperate

I'm having trouble thinking of other movies that did this, but it's usually movies that are made with the understanding that there will be sequels. I think Twilight is another example of this, which I know: Big surprise. But this is definitely something that happens a lot in movies right now, and it always leaves me with my jaw on the floor. Like: Really?! I'm worried Dune: Part II might do this :(",0,27,1704516959.0,2024-01-06 04:55:59,True
dune2,dune sequel,18x6rmy,What are some PG13 movies that should’ve been rated R?,"My picks are Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox and several other DC animated films. The film was extremely bloody and graphic for a PG13 movie. Not just that, but several other DC animated films were just as bloody and violent and still got PG13 ratings. Examples: Justice League: The New Frontier, The Dark Knight Returns, Son of Batman etc. And not a DC film but Venom and its sequel. I also think that the Dune film should’ve been R because there is some stuff in the book that would not give it a PG13 remake and had some extremely violent moments.",0,36,1704245637.0,2024-01-03 01:33:57,True
dune2,dune sequel,18n4lcl,my top 10 favorite movies of 2023,"firstly, i want to make something clear right off the bat. just because a movie is on the list doesn't mean i don't like it. if a movie is not on the list, i either haven't seen it, liked it but didn't think it was one of the best of the year, or i just plain didn't like it.

10: asteroid city

after the disappointment that was the french dispatch, i was cautiously optimistic about wes anderson's followup to that movie. thankfully, anderson managed to redeem himself with, what is in my opinion, one of his best movies to date. asteroid city is a very unique movie with a very unique style of storytelling that i feel that only anderson could pull off. it's also a very beautifully shot movie. actually, behind the grand budapest hotel, it might be anderson's best looking movie to date. if this movie does not get at least a cinematography nomination at the academy awards, i will be very disappointed. the film is also very funny and there were quite a few laugh out loud moments. the film is also a deep examination about art and i feel that this film was basically wes anderson's thesis on why he does what he does. the film is only at number 10 because, with a few exceptions, the performances are kinda iffy. the performances in wes anderson movies always tend to be very stony with a few notable exceptions. the performances aren't bad and there are some truly excellent performances but overall, the performances don't really stand out too much. otherwise, asteroid city is a really solid movie.

&#x200B;

9: cocaine bear

gangsters, park rangers, and CGI bears? what's not to love? cocaine bear seems like a movie that would only be entertaining due to being absolutely ridiculous. and while it most certainly is ridiculous, it does offer other things aside from just that. in addition to being a movie about a bear that goes on a cocaine fueled rampage, the film is also an honest to god crime comedy. the characters are pretty well developed and, while most of the characters are pretty shitty people, it's not hard to at least understand them. this is helped by the good performances. christian convery, ray liotta, margo martindale, and isiah whitlock jr in particular stood out. and then of course, there's the bear in the room. how is it that fucking cocaine bear has better CGI then most of the superhero movies that came out in 2023? seriously! while it is obvious that the bear is CGI, it's still pretty awesome looking. and although i sadly neglected to mention him in the performances, kudos to allan henry for his excellent and believable performance as the bear. the humor in the film is also solid. in addition to just how over the top the violence is(seriously, the people in this movie don't just die. they fucking suffer!), there are also quite a few moments of humor seperate from the violence and those moments are pretty good to. some of the funniest moments happen between the little girl and her young friend who are actually surprisingly well written and well acted. 2023 was the year of over the top violent comedy movies and cocaine bear was the best of them. it's also a major step up in quality from elizabeth bank's last directorial effort. but then again, just about anything is an improvement over THAT.

&#x200B;

8: nimona

i really didn't know what to expect going into this movie. i had just seen a few ads for it on tiktok. however, i remembered certain things about it. a shapeshifting girl teaming up with an adult male. that stuck in my head and made sure that i would remember it. then, i actually watched the movie and...it was pretty damn good. it was an adventure movie full of humor, heart, action, and social commentary. despite being rated PG, the film tackles some really heavy themes. questioning authority, nature vs nurture, and self harm. this is a modern kids movie where someone tries to kill themselves and it's taken dead seriously! nimona is easily my favorite movie character of the year and one of my favorite movie characters of all time. she is funny, witty, and emotionally complex. the other characters are pretty amazing to including the director who is one of the best movie villains of the decade so far. my only complaint about the movie is that there isn't more of it. i really do hope they make a sequel because, now that i have nimona in my life, i can't live without it.

&#x200B;

7: godzilla minus one

whenever a godzilla movie is set to release, be it an american production or a japanese production, it will instantly make my list of anticipated movies of the year. and i've been pretty spoiled this year. not only have we gotten the excellent monarch series this year but we also got godzilla minus one. as if i should have expected anything else from one of the most acclaimed directors currently working in japan, godzilla minus one is a solid movie that not only gives us everything we love about godzilla but also gives us some really solid human drama as well. as i watched the movie, i couldn't help but feel as though it had a similar tone to the original godzilla, which can only be a good thing since the original godzilla is excellent. as i watched the movie, it was obvious to me that this movie was made by someone with a deep appreciation for godzilla and sure enough, the director has confirmed that he was greatly influenced by the original godzilla. this film also gets bonus points for featuring the evilest depiction of godzilla i've ever seen. rather then just going on a rampage and having everyone around him be collateral damage, he actively hunts humans. that is terrifying and so awesome at the same time. godzilla minus one is a candidate for being in my top 10 favorite godzilla movies in the entire franchise.

&#x200B;

6: the killer

when you hear that the killer is about a hitman, you're probably expecting a john wick esque action thriller about an unstoppable killing machine who kills anyone and anything in his path. well, the newest film from director david fincher is as far from that as it's humanly possible to get, to the point where it could almost be considered the anti john wick. at it's heart, the killer is a deconstruction of typical assasin movies, taking every trope you generally associate with these types of movies and going in the complete opposite direction. and the most impressive thing about the killer is just how engaging it manages to be while doing so. the film is a suspenseful movie where you have no idea where the plot is going to go. the titular killer himself is also a very interesting character. he is cold, calculating, and remorseless. and yet, he goes through a character arc where he starts to question why he does the things he does and often questions his own set of morals. michael fassbender gives one of 2023's best performances as the killer but everyone else does pretty good in their roles as well. the film is extremely slow paced which could be a turn off. however, if you stick with the movie, you will be rewarded. (PS: you gotta love end of the year lists. they're the only place where a movie like the killer and a movie like nimona can get mentioned together.)

&#x200B;

5: poor things

yorgos lathimos is on his way to creating a reputation for being the terry gilliam of the new generation. like gilliam, his films are extremely absurd but have quite a bit of heart to them. and no film he has done makes a better case for that then poor things. poor things is a very strange movie but, if you're willing to look past the absurdity of it's premise, you'll find a funny, emotional, and well acted movie. easily the funniest movie of the year, poor things features quite a few funny moments throughout, mostly courtesy of the deadpan and bluntness that is prevalent in lathimo's movies. the film is also a very gripping emotional journey. star emma stone said that what attracted her to the project was the fact that she felt that it was a parallel to the journey of being a woman. and yeah, i can see that. the film also has quite a few good performances throughout. emma stone gives 110 percent to the point where, if margot robbie and lily gladstone weren't the forerunners for the best actress oscar, stone would be an easy win. mark ruffalo also goes all in with the comedy, giving one of his best performances. and of course, there's the legendary willem dafoe. how does he do? it's willem dafoe! how do you think he does? however, the three real stars of the movie are the cinematography, the production design, and the makeup. in regards to the cinematography, this is probably one of the best looking movies of the year and, if i was judging my favorite movies of the year based solely on how pretty they look, this movie would be WWAAYY higher on the list. the production design could best be described as if tim burton directed a movie set in the grand budapest hotel universe. and the makeup is really eye catching and well handled. all this stuff combined leads poor things to be a solid recommend from me.

&#x200B;

4: spiderman across the spiderverse

saying that 2023 has been a rough year for superhero movies would be like saying that the titanic has some water damage. most of the superhero movies that have come out in 2023 recieved mixed to negative reviews with most leaning more towards the ladder. and even generally well recieved movies like blue beetle bombed pretty freaking hard. indeed, it seems like this sub genre that once practically printed money is slowly starting to fall out of favor. however, for every rule, there is an exception. there are 2 superhero movies this year that everyone can safely agree were successes. guardians of the galaxy vol 3 and spiderman across the spiderverse. and of both these solid movies, spiderman across the spiderverse has made the list. have you ever gone into a movie with high expectations and still ended up blown away? that was basically my experience watching spiderman across the spiderverse. as amazing as spiderman into the spiderverse was, this movie did the unthinkable and managed to be even better then the first film. literally everything is an improvement. the animation, the characters, the writing, the humor, the drama, the everything. it really is amazing just how all out they went with this movie. if this movie gets nominated for best animated feature, the other nominees may as well not even show up to the ceremony. but most importantly, this movie should serve as a lesson to superhero movies in the future. make less movies and make better movies.

&#x200B;

3: the creator

one day, my best friend called me after i got off work and said if i wanted to see the creator. i hadn't really planned on going out of my way to go see it but i figured why not and said yes. and let me tell you, i'm glad that i did accept that invitation because the creator is excellent. this movie boasts some of the best cinematography and visual effects of any movie made during this year or even this decade. the acting is amazing with madeleine yuna voyles and ken watanabe being stand outs. i mean, the film isn't perfect since the story could have used a little tweeking and the morals are all over the place but it's such a well made movie that i can't help but sing it's praises. although i am extremely bummed out that dune part 2 got delayed, the creator filled the dune shaped hole in...i couldn't even finish that sentence. the only thing that will satisfy my dune part 2 lust is dune part 2. the creator is still good though.

&#x200B;

2: killers of the flower moon

brad jones of cinema snob fame described killers of the flower moon as ""heaven's gate if it was set in the goodfellas universe"". although i haven't seen heaven's gate, i do get what he was trying to say. but even without that comparison, killers of the flower moon is still a great movie. it takes an obscure part of american history that few people have heard of and even fewer know a whole lot about, and turns it into a steller crime thriller about the nature of evil. the movie is extremely hard to watch with numerous scenes of raw emotion and extreme violence, neither of which are surprising consider this is a Scorsese movie. the film is utterly unpleasant yet it's impossible to turn away. the film is also one of the most well acted movies of the year. leonardo dicaprio gives an excellent performance as the lead, lily gladstone manages to stand out in a movie with a whole bunch of talented actors, robert de niro shows that he's still got it, and even the minor actors like brenden fraser and john lithgow take their small performances and make meals out of them. my only real problem with the movie is it's pacing. the film is three hours in length with isn't inherently a bad thing. the problem is that it's pacing is extremely sluggish and it goes on way longer then it has to. the story ends an hour before the movie does. otherwise, killers of the flower moon is still an amazing movie. while i'm not quite sure if i would call it one of scorsese's best, it's easily the best movie he's made during this decade so far. i love you irishman but this movie is just much better.

&#x200B;

1: oppenheimer

what else could it have been? christopher nolan's oppenheimer is one of 2023's most acclaimed movies for a very good reason. it's excellent. it's though provoking, well shot, amazingly acted, and absolutely emotionally draining. i went to go see it with my dad and we both left the theater feeling absolutely numb. this is the type of movie that will make you feel emotionally drained in all the right ways. given the current political climate as well as all the crap happening outside our country, it's also a movie that couldn't have come at a more relevant time. it's so crazy when you think about it. this movie is the best movie of the year but it has very little action in it. well, the best movie of the year probably would have been dune part 2 but that ship has kinda sailed. nevertheless, christopher nolan has delivered yet another amazing movie, further cementing his reputation as one of the best filmmakers of this generation. his films are among the only ones that actually manage to live up to, or even surpass, people's expectations. we don't know what kind of movie he's going to make but, after oppenheimer, it's safe to say that expectations are extremely high. and knowing nolan, he's probably gonna surpass them.

dune2,dune sequel,17i8jul,Should I watch other riddick films?,"I love pitch black.  Watch it every year without fail.  Watched it initially when it came out (not in theatres) But I hate money grab sequels and I had never seen them.  Would you recommend them?  For reference here’s some movies I like semi-related:
Dune (omg so fkn good)
13th warrior 
The Faculty
Invasion of the body Snatchers
The above aren’t my fav movies or anything I just feel like they have similar themes to pitch black.  

Are the other movies in the franchise worth it for me? Swear to god not a troll and never seen a single full scene of them",20,55,1698478183.0,2023-10-28 08:29:43,True
dune2,dune sequel,17giqd5,What are your favorite movies?,"My list of underrated movies:

 

1. ""Stage Door"" (1937) - all my favorite film & TV actresses are in it. And I relate to all the main and supporting characters, in different ways. Katharine Hepburn, Lucille Ball, Andrea Leeds, Gail Patrick, and Andrea Leeds stole the show for me. This is my 2nd favorite movie of all-time, behind:
2. ""Peyton Place"" (1957) - Still ahead of its time. I grew up in a small town, extremely similar to Peyton Place (which is based on the book's author, Grace Metallious', real life small town in New Hampshire).
3. ""Marriage Story"" - I was furious when Adam Driver was nominated for an Oscar and didn't win. He gave the best performance of his career in this one; he's a true star & such an underrated actor.
4. ""Call Me By Your Name"" (2017) - Timothee Chalamet's first dramatic role; Elio (his character) endures a wide range of emotions, and this film is one of his best performances of his career. I watched the first 70 minutes of ""Dune"" (since my DVD player stopped, halfway through the movie) and CMBYN is much better than ""Dune"", although the open world of ""Dune"" is visually stunning. TC also deserved an Oscar win for CMBYN, and he was also robbed of an Oscar, just like Adam Driver was. At that point, I stopped watching the Oscars - younger dramatic actors (meaning under 45) don't get the respect & accolades anymore. (Maybe I should do some YouTube movie reviews or something)
5. ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940) - Lucille Ball is my favorite actress of all-time, but my favorite film actresses are a tie between Katharine Hepburn, Ann Miller and Lana Turner. KH truly shines as Tracy Lord; I once heard a reviewer say, ""Katharine Hepburn \*is\* Tracy Lord!"" I couldn't agree more.
6. ""Gone With The Wind"" (1939) - If resilience was a person, it'd be Vivien Leigh; a friend of Vivien's said about her, that ""She's equally Blanche DuBois, as she is, Scarlett."" Art imitates life.....
7. ""The Men"" (1950) - Marlon Brando & Teresa Wright were wonderful in it; Brando was almost \*too\* great; it made me think he mistreated women that way in real life, the way he mistreated Teresa's character. From Rita Moreno to all his ex-wives, I suspect ""The Men"" has subliminals about Marlon's misogyny toward women (which is all I thought of, when watching the movie - and I've seen the movie 3 times).
8. ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" - My personal favorite of Marilyn Monroe's iconic body of work. I loved she and Jane Russell in this - they were almost like Lucy Ricardo & Ethel Mertz (from ""I Love Lucy"") of the silver screen.
9. ""Sex & The Single Girl"" (1965) - It's been awhile since I saw it, but I remember absolutely loving it. I have a bit of a man crush on Tony Curtis myself. My mom (who's never seen a Natalie Wood movie in her life) even watched the movie. She said it's now her favorite Natalie Wood film. I saw ""West Side Story"" & ""Miracle on 34th Street"" as a kid, and loved both those films too, but SATSG is probably my favorite; did Natalie do more dramatic roles, besides SATSG?
10. ""Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows"" & its sequel, ""The Trouble With Angels"" - Rosalind Russell (who was Catholic in real life) and a young Hayley Mills are truly legends. Roz Russell is one of my all-time favorite actresses too, and she was born for comedic roles. And I enjoy Hayley Mills in this, as (the fake name she uses still makes me laugh) ""Fleur De Lie"" - both the first film and the sequel are 2 of my favorite '60s films. A shining example of physical comedy! I think those 2 films walked, so ""Sister Act 1 & 2"" could fly.
11. ""My Man Godfrey"" (1936) - The first Carole Lombard film I ever saw. I knew Gail Patrick from ""Stage Door"", so I was used to her typecasted role as the femme fatale and Irene's sister. I hated Gail as Linda in ""Stage Door"" - looking back now, my mother (in real life) \*became\* Linda; maybe that's why? But I absolutely loved Gail in MMG. And MMG is very much so Carole's best role; William Powell was great in this one, too. I think the fact that William & Carole were exes at that time, makes the movie 5 times funnier!
12. ""Mildred Pierce"" (1945) - This is a 5 star movie & Joan Crawford's greatest role. Eve Arden & Ann Blyth stole the show for me, personally. The famous scene where Mildred & Vida - shall we say - ""express choice words"" and Mildred says, ""Get out before I kill you!"" still (and I watched this movie for the first time as a 9 year old, way back in 2005, on TCM) - it still sends chills down my spine, that's how timeless this movie is! MP is the only noir film that keeps me guessing throughout; no other noir film really keeps me interested, except ""Sunset Boulevard"" - which I forgot to list, is also one of my favorite movies; Gloria Swanson is also extremely underrated and I always recognize her by her iconic eyebrows. I always say, ""I know those eyebrows - that's Gloria Swanson!""",0,11,1698277136.0,2023-10-26 00:38:56,True
dune2,dune sequel,16gz2t0,"These are the top 500 movies of all time, according to data from 30 websites","A sequel to the [top 100 movies list](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/164ougo/these_are_the_100_greatest_movies_of_all_time/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) I posted on here a few weeks ago. 

I went through data from 30 different websites for **almost 5000 movies**. The sites included critics sources like Sight & Sound (both critic and director lists) / TSPDT to American sites like Rotten Tomatoes / IMDb / Letterboxd / MovieLens / RateYourMusic to international sites like FilmAffinity / Douban / Filmweb / CSFD. Overall, this was able to achieve a more well-rounded and internationally representative list.

I weighted websites according to their relative SimilarWeb ranking and number of votes. I removed movies that had <5k votes on IMDb, as these had low numbers of votes across the board, and adjusted ratings if a film was review-bombed. There remains work to be done though; building a platform that provides real-time rankings and data of every single movie ever released is the ultimate goal. Feel free to share additional feedback and ideas, or just reach out to me through [this form](https://forms.gle/fDC3xFHdiELmEdjs8).

As always, a disclaimer that this is not an official ranking nor my personal ranking. These rankings reflect the opinions of thousands of critics and millions of people around the world.

My next post will be my top 1001 movies of all time list, so come support me through [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/reelstats) or simply share this project with all of your cinephile friends. Hope you find some gems on here.

dune2,dune sequel,15cfsqa,delaying the release of dune part 2 to next year would be an incredibly stupid idea.,"the highly anticipated sequel to 2021's dune is currently slated for a november 2023 release. however, as a result of the strike, warner brothers is considering delaying the release to 2024. let's go over why this would be an incredibly stupid thing to do.

firstly, warner brothers needs a moneymaker right now. their last few superhero movies have not done very well at the box office with the flash having recently ended it's theatrical run having made less then green lantern, one of the biggest superhero movie bombs of all time. suffice to say, they are in desperate need of a hit and dune part 2 will be just that. a sequel to one of warner brother's most acclaimed movies in recent years will practically print money. and with numerous projects being delayed, warner brothers needs all the cash they can get. as such, warner brothers literally cannot afford to delay this release. in fact, i'd even go so far as to say that they should be moving the release date UP.

secondly, delaying the release is only going to make the movie going public angry. delaying the release of an already completed movie that numerous people are super excited for when it's only a few months away from release will only serve to make people angry at them. and they don't even have the pandemic to use as an excuse. numerous movies are releasing during the strike right now so the strike isn't an excuse either.

the only logical reason i could see for them doing this was if it was a deliberate ploy to make people angry at the strikers so that the public will be on the studio's side. well, that won't work because most people know how to direct their anger towards the people who deserve it. the public will be angry but they will be angry at the studios and not the strikers. and it will only serve to make the public rally behind the strikers even more because now, the studios are resorting to extremely petty methods of retaliation. what are we? 12?

any way you slice it, pushing back the release date of dune part 2 is a really dumb idea. warner bros has nothing to gain but everything to lose by doing this. they are idiots for even considering doing it and they will be even stupider if they actually do it. the fact that the person who proposed that idea was not immediately fired is honestly baffling.",0,10,1690595601.0,2023-07-29 02:53:21,True

I’ve been on a Denis Villeneuve kick lately after recently watching Dune and Blade Runner 2049 again.  I decided to check out his back catalog.  He’s an amazing visual storyteller.  I noticed that Sicario had a sequel made without him so I’m wondering if it’s worth watching.  Is it anywhere near as good as the first movie?",39,59,1689022756.0,2023-07-10 21:59:16,True

dune2,dune sequel,1357hwu,"Seriously, why don’t they make an animated version of Jodorowsky’s Dune?","Now we have Villeneuve’s version of Dune. It’s epic, it’s successful, and it is basically the book. We’ve had a television version, and we’ve had the weird David Lynch verse which is the unhappy medium between the book and the surreal. 

Knowing that we essentially have all the design and the entire movie storyboarded, with casting planned gor the leads, what’s stopping it ftom being made? Even Jodorowsky himself suggested it in the documentary.

Design the Emperor to look like Dali! Get Mick Jagger to voice Feud Rautha! Have Maurice laMarche do his Oraon Welles impression for Baron Harkonnen!

Yes, the movie would be psychedelic and bizarre and very different from the book. But now that we’ve had a solid version of the book on film, why not a wacky adaptation? It wouldn’t be Herbert’s but it was a movie conceived when only one of the sequels even existed. Herbert sold the rights to that team, and so why not?

In a world where we have Richard Donner’s Superman II and Zack Snyder’s Justice League, and even Kubrick’s Napoleon being realized, it would be an awesome thing to actually make this film a reality.",0,22,1682990891.0,2023-05-02 02:28:11,True

There's something about a big spectacle popcorn event that I can go to with the family and enjoy the show. My problem right now is that there is nothing coming up to really look forward to.

Marvel is slowly dying off for me. The last time I absolutely HAD to go to a Marvel movie was Endgame. Since then I've been disappointed in every one of them and now I just try to catch the newer movies on Disney+. The last Star Wars movie I loved was Rogue 1. I was really excited for TLJ, didn't like it, and suffered through whatever the last movie was called. And I watch the series without any real energy. Even Andor, the best of the lot, seemed to have some strange plotting choices with the heist followed by the prison. And then it just kind of ended. In the 2000s, I had a Harry Potter movie to look forward to every year. 

In late 2014 I saw the trailer for The Force Awakens and COULDN'T WAIT to see it the next year. In 2016 I watched Captain America: Civil War and absolutely loved it. But now, in 2023, the only thing I'm kind of looking forward to is the Dune sequel. But, really, it's not the same thing.

dune2,dune sequel,y4dg2s,The Problem With Sequel Trilogies,"I recently watched Halloween Ends, the conclusion to the Halloween sequel trilogy made up of Halloween (2018), Halloween Kills, and Halloween Ends. All are direct sequels to Halloween (1978) and ignore all other installments. After seeing Ends, the movie made me realize the problems with trilogies these days, especially sequel trilogies. 

The first two films usually feel really close together, with the second film a lot of times being a direct result of the end of the first film. Then the third film comes along and it’s just so different. Sometimes it’s a time jump, sometimes it’s a different setting than the other two, but the main point is, the third film usually feels different. I think the reason for this is that studios nowadays are too scared of one thing, the reception of the second film. For example, Jurassic World was well received by critics and made a lot at the box office, while it’s sequel, Fallen Kingdom, made less and was not as well received. Star Wars: The Force Awakens was also very well received by audiences and critics, while its sequel, The Last Jedi, was drastically more divided. Halloween (2018) was thought to be the best Halloween sequel and became the highest-grossing slasher film upon release, while Halloween Kills was received more negatively. 

The problem studios have with trilogies now is that the second film always goes out of its way to having its ending set up the third film, making the second film feel incomplete. There are plenty of second films that set up the third film well while completing their own story, but a lot of movies have gotten lazier at this, especially Halloween Kills. Because of this, the second film has a good chance at being received to a more mixed reception, causing the studio to panic. They think, ""People didn’t like the second one, we have to make the third one a lot more different."" 

This one thing is ruining trilogies. They set up the third film with a mediocre second film, and then get scared when that second film isn’t as well received as the first one, so the third film is this awkward outlier that feels completely different from the first two. That happened with this Halloween Ends. No matter what the director or anyone on the crew says, the reception of Halloween Kills changed this movie. I feel like if that movie was better received, there wouldn’t have been this big time jump and all three movies in the Halloween sequel trilogy would have taken place on the same night, or at least on the same weekend. 

When making a trilogy, there needs to be a complete idea that is stuck to regardless of how the films are received. I think small changes are fine, but there needs to be a limit. Even if they’re all bad, at least they’re all consistent. I think studios should strive more towards making duologies when making legacy films, as it’s easier to tell a complete story in two films than it is with three. That’s why I’m happy Dune is getting a two-film adaption instead of them trying to cut it into three movies somehow. Both Blade Runner films are amazing alone and even better together, and I think both Top Gun films play to their own strengths, and together make a really good double feature. If there are only going to be two Top Gun films, I’m completely fine with that. The Tron films are also a good example of a movie and it’s legacy sequel making up a duology. As for the Halloween series, for me, the only two films that are canon are Halloween (1978) and Halloween (2018).",0,18,1665804760.0,2022-10-15 04:32:40,True

dune2,dune sequel,x2x4hb,Post-Marvel movies and The Northman,"This post is not really about The Northman. It's about the landscape of modern cinema. I'd like to hear what folks make of the current situation. If you hate The Northman and are triggered just by seeing its title then please take your kneejerk negativity elsewhere. Thank you.

That said...

We live in a post-Marvel world. It was fun while it lasted, but the shine has worn off and now that massive, CGI-fuelled, episodic phenomenon is over. In its wake has come a slew of wannabes and copycats and otherwise abject bloated duds, including Marvel's own new phase, but also a handful of very fine films, some of which have been relative commercial successes like Dune, but some like The Northman have flopped in spectacular fashion. This is not a new phenomena per say, but considering the current situation it is more worrying now than ever.

I've had loads of discussion about these kinds of films, but especially about The Northman, and everyone has their own theory it seems. Some say it was too dark, too artsy. Some say it should have been darker and artsier. Some people claim it lacked action while others say it was too violent. Some say it was gorgeous while others found it dreary. It has its fans of course, I love the film and am still confounded as to how it wasnt a massive success, but it's a very divisive movie in general, which some would say is a sign of great art, but in any case it flopped.

Whatever the reason, this is very sad. Even if you hated The Northman this is not a good thing. For decades now we've seen reboot after remake after sequel after prequel after once-loved IP tarnished by the hacks that constitute working filmmakers at the moment. Meanwhile, Robert Eggers, a filmmaker who could not be loved more by fans and critics alike, has now all but officially had his big budget credentials revoked. 

Eggers himself has said he did not like working under the big studio model and is happy to return to smaller scale production, which I can understand, but I can't help but think that had The Northman been more successful at the box office then Eggers would have certainly been given far more freedom on any future major film he worked on. Something that would have been only a good thing for cinema but is no longer possible.

Decades ago Ridley Scott found a great solution to this situation. He'd make the film he wanted, let the studio release the cut they thought would sell the most tickets, and then he would release his Director's Cut. These films often were successful at the box office, and when the DC released the fans bought it in droves. Everybody wins, except for people like myself who want to see a brilliant film like the Kingdom of Heaven DC on the big screen, but I digress. According to Eggers there is no Director's Cut of The Northman. He essentially made his compromises with the studio along the way. It wasn't neutered in the editing. It was compromised during production. Maybe you can blame him for approaching it this way rather than Scott's way, but that's not really the point I'm trying to make here. 

We live in an age of content saturation, where the line between the big screen and the small screen has been blurred to such a degree that Villeneuve had to go head to head with execs to get Dune released in theaters rather than just streaming on HBO. Audiences have generally been conditioned to expect human characters to act like superheros lest they be viewed as ""boring,"" and people have been so overwhelmed by vibrant yet vapid CGI visuals that it's become both expected and also absolutely unimpressive. Robert Eggers is a fantastic director. Nobody serious really debates that, but due to the current Disney-dominated, post-Marvel landscape, and the monetary failure of The Northman, I think we may see studios take even less chances going forward. We may never get the next The Northman.",0,20,1662003089.0,2022-09-01 04:31:29,True
dune2,dune sequel,x2fa4b,David Lynch’s Dune is a great movie and aged very well.,"[(Included a link to some space wave music for a nice background while reading this post)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1J9LqFHhJmzNxgzcO18CLX)

No, this is not an attempt to bash Villeneuve’s Dune, which I consider obviously close to the source and I am a huge fan and of.

But the 1984 movie stands on its own merit and, while not as close to the source material as the latest film (among other things, Lynch once said he was not a fan of “kung fu in the desert”) but it conveys very well the elements of the universe of the book series sometimes even best than the 2021 film, and here are some examples [no spoilers]:

- It shows the point of view of the Emperor, with a magistral and alas underrated performance by the late Jose Ferrer: his machinations, his relationship to the other powers of the Imperium. Also, the throne room scene with the walls and pillars of gold emphasized how rich was the Corrino house, an important element in the book.

- It shows how powerful really the Guild was at the time, capable of forcing the hand of the Emperor and even threaten violence against his person. Also, the design of the Edric Navigator was flawless, straight out of the second book (because they weren’t really shown in Dune).

- The cenography was amazing and I personally prefer it to 2021 Dune. Certain details like eg. the decorated gate where the ships enter the Highliner.

It seems to me that, alongside the original additions of the movie (such as the weirding module, a cool idea by itself but which does not really adds much to the story despite being made a central plot device), Lynch included a lot of the elements of the Appendices of the original book and even some from the sequels (Edric as mentioned was one). That was great for word building purposes since much of the elements of the book are really hard to translate to the big screen and yet are necessary for immersion in the universe depicted in the story. Even Villeneuve understands this, hence the Salusa Secundus scene in his movie.

Plus, Dune 1984 has a pretty impressive soundtrack by Toto and Brian Eno (of course, the 2021’s soundtrack by Hans Zimmer was also fantastic).",2,18,1661956697.0,2022-08-31 15:38:17,True

[Last week's numbers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/wuswh1/official_box_office_streaming_discussion_for_the/)

# ""Leave the poor girl alone. You’re like a Pomeranian.""

I saw *Nope* yesterday, and I have to say that it was pretty good. Too bad it fell off the charts this week and probably won't return. However, it more than doubled its reported budget on a global scale as it went international just two weeks ago. Try catching this on the big screen, because that Hoytema cinematography is worth it.

*Maverick* continues to bring in a lot of cash. And although it doesn't show any signs of slowing down right now, I wonder if it still can bring in another 40mil to pass *Frozen II* on the [Global BO of all time](https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/worldwide/all-movies/cumulative/all-time). But I certainly won't be surprised if it did.

# Headlines of the week

*Cucumber time* continues as the only mildly interesting headlines this week are [Aquaman 2's delay to Christmas 2023](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/aquaman-shazm-sequel-release-dates-1235191860/), with *Shazam 2* taking its spot. [Star Trek 4 lost its director](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/star-trek-4-loses-director-matt-shakman-2023-movie-1235207049/). And that *Maverick* released on streaming.

Anyway, how are you? No, how are you *really?* You good? Yeah?

You guys catch anything in the theatre or on streaming this weekend? I bet y'all watched that Maverick *again* on streaming, didn't you?

dune2,dune sequel,w5b786,Which ongoing movie franchises have a fixed end date?,"Movie franchises in Hollywood don't usually end with there being high potential for unnecessary sequels, remakes, reboots etc. However there have been instances where franchises have had an end point or at least one for a major story arc. Take something like the original trilogy of the Lord of the Rings or the Godfather trilogy.  My question is which currently ongoing movie franchises have already decided upon a fixed number of movies to be made in that franchises before that franchise ends? Aka having a fixed ending in sight. 

Like for example Fast and Furious 11 is set to be final film of the main saga of the Fast and Furious series. Or how Denis Villeneuve has stated that he has a plan for a trilogy for the Dune movies and after that he would call it quits. Which other movie franchises have fixed end dates ?",0,9,1658498011.0,2022-07-22 14:53:31,True

**Critics concensus**:
>A sequel aimed squarely at fans of the original's odd couple chemistry, Venom: Let There Be Carnage eagerly embraces the franchise's sillier side.

>Doesn't have that sense of joyful discovery and gleeful mischief that the first film did, because it's obviously now a comedy on purpose. But the Venom/Eddie dynamic remains the best buddy action comedy going these days.  

[Detroit News, D](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/2021/09/30/venom-let-there-carnage-review-let-there-silence-please/5898267001/ )
>It's short, cheap looking and maybe made for 8-year-olds. It's only fun if your idea of fun is being screamed at by a demon voice while staring at a mishmash of special effects for an hour and some change.

[SF Chronicle 0/4](https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/movies-tv/review-venom-2-should-not-be-watched-it-should-be-shunned)
>It's the worst movie Tom Hardy ever made. It's the worst movie Woody Harrelson ever made. And it's the worst movie Michelle Williams ever made.

[Bleedingcool, 6.5](https://bleedingcool.com/movies/venom-let-there-be-carnage-review-doesnt-overstay-its-welcome/)
>Venom: Let There Be Carnage knows exactly what it wants to be, shows up, and then ends before it gets overly long. While not a great movie, it's much more tonally consistent than the first one and leans into the things that worked.

[Cinemablend 2/5](https://www.cinemablend.com/movies/venom-let-there-be-carnage-review-the-tom-hardy-sequel-teaches-how-not-to-hurdle-an-extremely-low-bar)
>Rather than really make an effort to change things, the production clearly saw the previous movie's success as validation of its bad choices, so it regularly succumbs to many of the same issues...

[CNN, Rotten](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/30/entertainment/venom-review/index.html)
>A mind-numbingly tiresome sequel, filled with uninspired comedy and a CGI monster fight that seems to drag on forever.

[Rogerebert.com 3/4](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/venom-let-there-be-carnage-2021)
>Silliness was the first film's strength, which everyone involved seems to have realized and leaned into hard for the follow-up.

[Variety, Rotten](https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/venom-let-there-be-carnage-review-1235077693/)
>Overseeing it all is Serkis, who understands the technology required to get the necessary virtual performances better than almost anyone, but demonstrates almost no vision as a director.

[The Atlantic, Rotten](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/09/venom-let-there-be-carnage-movie-review/620251/)
>The viewing experience is like going to a nightclub and having someone scream the plot in your ear over a thumping bass line -- ironic, given that Venom's biggest weakness is sound waves.

[Wall Street Journal, Fresh](https://www.wsj.com/articles/venom-let-there-be-carnage-movie-review-tom-hardy-11633037638?tesla=y)
>To its perverse credit, Venom 2, as it's being called, manipulates its audience with all the tentacles it can deploy, most of them cheerfully ridiculous.

[Vanity Fair, Rotten](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/09/review-venom-let-there-be-carnage-ruins-the-joke)
>It is mostly noisy and flimsy and without purpose, a hasty response to the original's unexpected success and little else. Naturally a third film is advertised at the end.

[New York Post 1/4](https://nypost.com/2021/09/30/venom-let-there-be-carnage-is-the-worst-hero-series-ever/)
>Sitting at ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage,"" you quietly ask yourself, ""What have I done wrong? Is God punishing me?""

venom2,venom sequel,nzwunk,"What are some movies you want a sequel of, that currently has none and likely never will?","I still want a sequel to Spider-Man 3, with Sam Raimi at the helm with Sony backing the picture. I can say I am 0% excited for Venom 2 and the actual Spider-Man 3 Sony/Marvel are releasing.

I also want a Pulp Fiction 2, as I recently rewatched this and it is probably my favorite QT movie, more than Kill Bill Vol 1 now.

Princess Bride 2 with the same principal cast would be cool. I never got into this movie and almost gave up on this, but watched it thoroughly last week and it's good.

Bill & Ted 4 with Thea and Billy being the main stars, with Bill and Ted being supporting cast members.

Man of Steel 2 would be appreciated. BvS is technically a sequel to MoS, but back in 2013-2014, I think Zack wanted a to do a sequel, but WB wanted to add Batman.",0,84,1623704326.0,2021-06-14 21:58:46,True

venom2,venom sequel,myjrjg,I will summarize the movie Mortal Kombat without knowing anything about it.,"So the movie begins in the feudal japan, where a samurai is living the dream with his family in the woods. He kisses his wife in the forehead and tells her how much he loves her and I’m like “wow, you so dead already?” and the movie didn’t disappoint me there, only took 30 seconds for her to be slain by some sort of ice cream ninja.

So the samurai wants to avenge his family, and he argues with him in Japanese, but he’s Chinese, the samurai tells him he doesn’t understand a word. So the ninja, who also speaks Japanese, replies back in English and kills the samurai.

A long time later, we meet this guy Cole, he’s a fighter, not a very good one. He fights for food, shampoo or anything he’s offered. His daughter is his cornerman, who looks older than both his parents. While he’s inside a neck crank she tells him not to surrender, seems she wants her heritage quick.

Then this black guy with a creepy 80s moustache saves them from the ice cream ninja. But the ninja blows up both his arms. You know when a beer gets stuck in the back of the freezer, and you’re too stubborn to let it go, unload everything and try again? Yeah, your hand gets cold, and also the beer is frozen so it explodes when you open it.

So Cole meets Sonya (whose name is the easiest to remember from the whole thing), she seems pissed, she was about to begin a BDSM session in her living room with an aussie hobbo. She keeps asking where the black guy is, guess she was expecting a threesome.

She explains to Cole his mark is an invitation to a tournament called Mortal kombat, where they’ll need to fight to the death. Thank god Cole dedicated his life to martial arts, imagine he ended up a lawyer or as an apple store salesman, what a waste.

They get attacked by some reptilian creature that spits venom: “Vaccines cause autism” “the earth is flat” that kind of shit. The aussie hobbo summons his inner Steve Irwin and goes “look at the size of that thing… I’m gonna pet it”.

They have to get to some temple but the only one who knows its location is the aussie hobbo. They offer him their pocket money and let him fulfill his request of cumming on the garden gnome as a part of the deal. As he failed his driving test for the 7th time, he asks her auntie if she can drive him and his friends there. Apparently wasn’t his favourite auntie and she leaves them about 20 miles away in the middle of the desert with a canteen full of salt.

Then they met a shaolin monk, but he has hair. He said he was given the task to find earth’s champions. How long ago was this? 30 min? you only went 20 feet from the main entrance, and now one of the champions is a log.

They reach the temple which had some very cool concept art, but the movie was on a budget and they could only afford a cave. There’s this weird piece of tech atrezzo that someone’s son did. It’s like a giant glowing anal bead, and they seem very proud of it because they show it a lot of times even though it doesn’t fit at all.

They meet Chinese Thor, but he’s a jerk. He says in order to have an opportunity they have to unlock their inner power. The aussie becomes cyclops but Cole can’t do shit, even though they tingle his g-spot and everything, so he quits and goes back with his family. Oh, and by the way, they’ve fixed the armless guy by nailing two forks onto his severed limbs, one longer than the other. “Yeah, it will do”.

So the baddies show up, apparently the aussie hobbo has betrayed them for a real job and two big macs. They throw the fork guy in there like “go get some wins champ” against a massive guy with a sledgehammer. An they keep wondering why they’re loosing.

The villain is and old lady in a dressing gown who feasts on the souls of the young people. Just like my mother in law. His followers are emo flash, a flying junkie and a dentist’s dream.

There’s this guy who went professional at throwing frisbee and shows the flying junkie the reason you’d never stick your tongue into the ceiling fan.

Meanwhile Cole gets ambushed by Machamp, which unlocks his inner power which is literal plot armor made from repurposed basketballs. He just stand there and absorbs damage like Homer Simpson’s boxing career. It is very OP, pls nerf.

Chinese Thor interrupts the brawl right after grandma kills the frisbee superstar and banished them all into outer space. Which would have been neat for him to do right when they showed up. The fork guy got a new pair of swiss army arms by buying winrar.

Chinese Thor teleports the good guys to a purgatory where they’re safe and can’t be reached (again, why he didn’t take them there in the first place? Because he’s a jerk I told you!). They plan to win by diving their enemies, which makes sense, by dividing themselves, which made no sense at all. Why not 4v1 everybody? These guys don’t follow the rules in the first place.

Anyways, the swiss army arms guy smashes the sledgehammer guy’s head right before he was about to say his first line of dialogue. Sonya kills the aussie, who had been carrying the whole film in his back, with the garden gnome because karma is a bitch and then goes help Cole because somehow after killing the 1600lbs 10ft tall 9-times champ monster, he struggles to put out the girl with weird teeth.

Cole then gets dragged out by the ice cream ninja who apparently kidnapped his family. They look very dead to me, but apparently because they’re fresh frozen they’re safe from dying from hypothermia later. Cole’s ancestor comes to aid from hell, he’s now fire ninja, and pokemon taught me ice cream ninja is no match for him.

We’re 80 min deep in the movie and these two keeps saying these things “for the Shirayariu” “for the lin koei” which I have no clue what they mean. Heck, I don’t even know why they hate each other in the first place. Anyways, the ice cream ninja becomes roasted duck and then the old lady in pajamas begans to threaten the audience with a sequel.

The ending scene is what kills the joy for me. After a career full of bad written dialogues and terrible one liners, Cole Young gets a shot to star at Hollywood. How? It is still a mystery to me bigger than when he learned perfect Japanese in South Chicago.

Sandra Bullock - one of my all time favourites. Say what u want. She has this movie with Viola Davis and Vincent D'Onofrio for Netflix for this year probably.

Olivia Colman - amazing actress. Its just...different. Love her. Movies coming. HBO series coming. Exciting.

Benedict Cumberbatch - more Doctor Strange. A Netflix movie with a stacked cast. A Amazon movie. Great decade for him i feel. 

Elizabeth Moss - Apple thriller series. The French Dispatch. Lot more i hope. 

Natalie Portman - I dont know why she has almost no work. Stunning actress. So happy to see her as Lady Thor or female God of Thunder. Hope She gets to star in a drama series to see her really going in.

Brad Pitt - one of the greatest. He has a couple of movies coming. Hope to hear more of him


Florence Pugh - has a huge future ahead. Will be the new Black Widow going forward. She has a WB thriller coming. And will probably be VERY busy this next decade.

Christian Bale - one of the greatest also. Cant wait to see him in Thor 4 as the main villain. He also has a Netflix movie announced in February. And more for sure its coming.  

Emily Blunt - she's a blast. Jungle Cruise looks so much fun. She is going to star is a western series for Amazon. Thats sounds amazing. My dream is to one day grab my phone, and see that she has been cast as Sue for the F4 movie. Although its unlikely. But i still dream.

Would Love to hear your 30 most exciting actors for this decade. If you think its a lot, put as many as you want.",3,22,1617926906.0,2021-04-09 01:08:26,True

venom2,venom sequel,koncqx,Netflix has too many Christmas movies. I watched 20 of them this December,"My significant other and I found ourselves with a lot of time on our hands this Christmas, and since we both love Christmas movies we decided to watch as many of them as we could on Netflix. Some of them are old classics, others are new classics, others are pretty mediocre fluff, and still others are hot garbage. Inspired by [this post, rating Nicolas Cage DTV movies,](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/ffyvir/nicolas_cage_made_29_directtovideo_movies_in_the/) I decided to rate/review every one we saw. Here they are, in no particular order

**Let It Snow - 5/10**  Based on a John Green book, and it's probably way better as a book. There's just too many storylines to follow and not enough screentime to properly develop any of them, so every character arc is a bare-bones YA stereotype: the guy trying to throw a cool party realizes the cool was in his heart all along, the guy in love with his best friend finally works up the courage to make out with her, the cool one who's secretly lonely finds a friend, etc. Super predictable, but still made me feel warm & fuzzy inside. +1 for the tinfoil hat lady.

&#x200B;

**The 12 Pups of Christmas - 1/10**  The acting is terrible and the plot makes zero sense, but this is a Hallmark movie so that's par for the course; what really ruins this movie is how unlikeable the main character is. She delivers every other line with a venom that does NOT fit a brightly colored, Hallmark Christmas movie about puppies. Would have been a 0/10 but the pups are just too darn cute

&#x200B;

**The Princess Switch - 6/10**   When a Christmas romance movie has ALL the tropes, it has to find a balance between taking itself lightly enough that the tropes don't feel generic and boring, while still taking itself seriously enough that the audience can feel good about getting invested in the story. *The Princess Switch* walks this line really well, and I was surprised how much I liked it.

As with all Christmas romance movies, the plot is a juuuust little contrived (Vanessa Hudgens gets inspired to compete in an international baking competition after running into her ex-boyfriend, then happens to run into her doppelganger who is also a princess of a small european country with a Christmas-based culture and economy) But once you get past the exposition, a heart-warming love story ensues, with enough sincerity to make you forget about the dumber plot points. Solid movie.

&#x200B;

**A Christmas Prince - 5/10**  *A Christmas Prince* leans a bit too far in the other direction. It is probably the most formulaic Christmas movie I've seen: girl with a kickass fun job in NY gets to go to a Christmas Kingdom for Christmas, and falls in love with a prince when she's not supposed to. Ditzy Mary-Sue protagonist who is somehow always right when the plot wants her to be? Check. Prince who's not sure he wants the responsibility of being king, but has his mind changed by *love*? Check. A palace intrigue in which the clear villain (the only character with dark hair) tries to steal the throne? Check check check! This movie has it all. And unlike The Princess Switch, A Christmas Prince plays it completely straight, which I think hurts it a little. But in the end, the movie knows what it is and delivers, which is more than I can say for its sequels. (We'll get to those later and hoooo boy are they something. hold onto your pants)

&#x200B;

**Christmas With a Prince - 0/10**  I think this is supposed to be a children's movie that Netflix forgot to label as such. The sets are all brightly multi-colored, the comedy is either slapstick or that weird brother-sister dynamic that you used to see on low-budget Disney channel originals, and every plot point is spoon fed to you so plainly that you can almost hear your mother making airplane noises. This movie wasn't just bad, it was so specifically bad that I'm pretty sure it's literally meant for children aged 8-14. But I watched the entire thing for you, the people. This post better get some upvotes.

&#x200B;

**A Muppet Christmas Carol - 11/10**   A true classic that I cheated in order to watch (I don't believe its on Netflix, but I had to see it).  I've seen this before when I was a kid, and watching it again it amazes me how good this is. Not only are the muppets their usual combination of funny and heartwarming, but their goofiness is perfectly offset by some chilling musical numbers and a truly gut-wrenching performance by Michael Caine. I honestly don’t know how he did this while surrounded by muppets the whole time, but he sells the more emotional scenes SO well.

This movie has been inducted into the ""re-watch every year"" tier. If you haven't seen it, you should.

&#x200B;

**The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show - 8/10**  Cheating a little on this one too, since its on Amazon Prime and not Netflix, but my significant other and I both love Kacey Musgraves too much to not watch this. It brings a nice retro touch to a year that desperately needed it, and it balances some classic, cheesy Christmas numbers with some dry segments in-between courtesy of Dan Levy. Also contains an original song, ""Christmas Always Makes Me Cry"", that fucking wrecks me every time I hear it. Its SO GOOD

&#x200B;

**The Princess Switch 2: The Switchening - 3/10**   A hot mess that does not take itself seriously enough. Part of the fairytale ending from the original is destroyed in the exposition so that we can get a new and improved fairytale ending, except with an EVEN MORE contrived plot to get there, and a key character played by a different actress. Every fun gimmick from the original is dialed up to 11, and it's so over-the-top that it sort of clashes with the more sincere, lovey-dovey, happily-ever-after vibe that they're simultaneously going for. But it IS pretty funny, in a sort of 'so-bad-it's-good' way.

If you have access to Netflix and don't want to watch the whole movie, just jump to 39:14. This one line had me rolling for a solid 5 minutes.

**The Knight Before Christmas - 1/10**  Apparently when Vanessa Hudgens saw critics saying that the plot to *The Princess Switch* was a bit much, she went ""they think *that* was contrived? Watch this!"" and then made this movie as an elaborate prank. At least I think that's what happened, because I have no other convincing explanation for how this movie got made.

&#x200B;

**A Christmas Prince 2: The Royal Wedding - 2/10**   In the second installment of the Christmas Prince series, the central conflict involves our Mary Sue becoming uncomfortable with the uptight restrictions of royal life, and wishing more people would take her opinion on the Aldovian economic crisis seriously rather than relegate her to wedding planning.

This one is just as basic as the original. However, because Mary Sue is already with the prince, the plot doesn't have a love story to lean on, and instead revolves around Mary Sue miraculously solving the economic crisis by discovering a sinister plot to undermine the government's economic initiatives. It's a weirdly boring intrigue for a Christmas movie, thrown into the foreground by the lack of a love story, and made even worse by the additions of comic relief characters Rudy and Sahil, whose entire schtick is just very exaggerated accents (and also Sahil being flamboyantly gay?) I know it's a Christmas movie and your audience is predominantly white, but come on. This movie was made in 2018, I thought we all agreed that was no longer an acceptable punchline.

&#x200B;

**A Christmas Prince 3: The Royal Baby - 1/10**   This movie introduced me to the Netflix Christmas Cinematic Universe, or NCU. It turns out that the Christmas Kingdom from this series, Aldovia, shares a border with the Christmas Kingdom of Belgravia, from the *Princess Switch* series. Aldovia's closest ally, however, is a nation called Penglia, and the third installment of the series sees Mary Sue try her hand at diplomatic relations when the royal family of Penglia comes to re-sign a centuries old treaty as is tradition. The plot is just as tiresome as *The Royal Wedding:* there's more palace intrigue, Mary Sue solves the case, etc. The exaggerated accents for comedy continue, with Rudy (Mary Sue's very Italian father who sounds like if pizza could talk) accounting for more of it this time. This does not make it any better.

In addition to the bad plot and movie, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the universe makes no sense. Penglia looks like the geographical equivalent of Georgia or Armenia (at least according to this map from the movie which bears a striking resemblence to how Europe looks in real life), but the Penglians in the movie are played by British Asian actors and bear traditionally Chinese? names. Also, there is still a New York City and a Chicago in this universe, so what happened in the past to get Europe to this state that would still allow for the formation of America? Do Great Britain and France exist in this universe? Does Italy exist, and if not, where did Rudy learn to make that food? More importantly, does Germany exist? If not, where does this Christmas culture displayed in the Christmas Kingdoms come from? Did either world war happen? Did Aldovia and Belgravia fight for the Axis in World War II?! I'm thinking about this too much, but I wish Netflix had thought about it just a little more.

&#x200B;

**Holidate - 4/10**  Not good at all. Rather than go for the cheesy and heartwarming type of rom-com, Holidate goes for a more laugh-out-loud, raunchy style of comedy. This *can* work, as evidenced by *National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,* but you need good comedic actors/actresses in order to deliver that type of comedy properly. Unfortunately, neither Emma Roberts nor Larry Hemsworth can really measure up to anyone in *Christmas Vacation*'s cast, and so a lot of the more ambitious bits (like the pants-shitting scene or the finger scene) fall really flat. And with no warm, fuzzy feels to rescue it, those comedic failures are right at the forefront and make the movie hard to enjoy.

To rant a bit further, the casting for this movie is real weird. When trying for this type of comedy, it's bad enough to cast Emma Roberts (who plays the same jaded emotionless character in everything she does from *We're the Millers* to *American Horror Story* to *Little Italy*) alongside a relatively unknown Australian soap/action star with no comedy chops. But they also cast a talented SNL player, Alex Moffat, as the straightest of straight men in this movie, and THEN opt to cast a Vine star in a more comedic role. None of it makes sense, and it's just a mess.

&#x200B;

**Klaus - 10/10**   Incredible. I don't even know if I've ever seen a movie about the origin of Santa Claus before, but this movie has everything. Stunning animation, great character development for multiple characters, J.K. Simmons, and a heartwarming message about the spirit of good and giving. It hits especially hard right now, at a time in the world where it seems like everything is terrible; it's really nice to see a movie not only reminding us that Christmas is a time for giving, but that giving MEANS something, and can help make the world a better place.

I'll be watching this movie every year as well. It's that good.

&#x200B;

**The Christmas Chronicles - 7/10**  I'm kind of a sucker for movies with a more down-to-earth, human depiction of Santa Claus. The Christmas Chronicles delivers a pretty funny action flick starring Kurt Russell as Santa who has to interact with the normal world on Christmas Eve in order to fix his sleigh, recover his magic Santa mojo, and save Christmas. The kids are walking stereotypes (awful teen with daddy issues and too-cute little sister who still believes in Santa)  but in the end it doesn't matter because Kurt Russell steals the show.

&#x200B;

I really appreciated how his depiction of Santa was more human and less whimsical, without losing any of his Christmas spirit; it's a tough balance to pull off in these sorts of movies (see *The Santa Clause*  for an example of a lesser actor definitely NOT pulling it off)

&#x200B;

**Get Santa - 8/10**  I mentioned how I'm a sucker for a down-to-earth Santa? I'm also a huge sucker for ""Bad Santa who is totally done with everyone's bullshit"" tropes. It resembles *The Christmas Chronicles* in many ways, and probably inspired many elements of it, but with the addition of a really dry sort of humor that contrasts very well with the cheesy cheer you'd normally see in a Christmas movie (I think it's a British thing? I get *Death at a Funeral* vibes and I think that's one of the best comedies ever made).

&#x200B;

**The Christmas Chronicles Part Two: Electric Boogaloo - 6/10**  This movie is a real testament to why its important to keep things simple. The original works because there's only one major plot driver - Santa lost his mojo and needs to get it back. There's no weird villain with a crazy backstory, no awful CGI elves, and no convoluted origin story for aforementioned elves. All of these weird distractions really take away from part two, but in the end it's still got the core that made the original fun to watch: Kurt Russell's badass Santa saving Christmas (with the new addition of Goldie Hawn as Mrs. Claus which really works well). No movie that starts with Santa *hunting a giant saber-toothed lynx* can be bad, come on now

&#x200B;

**The Holiday Calendar - 5/10**  An un-focused mess with a fun little love triangle, magical advent calendar, and Ron Cephas Jones. A lot of the side characters' motivations throughout the movie remain a mystery (why does her boss randomly fire her? Why does her love interest remain shy despite his incredible looks? Why is her short-term fling a douche one minute, but a sweetie the next? We may never know). But in the end it's sweet, and unlike most Christmas romance movies, the leads are actually attractive this time, so +1 for that

&#x200B;

**Christmas Catch - 3/10**  A Christmas action flick that doesn't really bring the cheer as much as one might like.  It's not terrible, but it definitely felt like another one of those shitty action flicks that just had a Christmas label slapped onto it at the end for marketability, which I didn't appreciate.

&#x200B;

**Jingle Jangle - 5/10**  This was the last one we saw, and it was the biggest disappointment of the entire month for me, because I was *so sure it would be amazing* and it turned out to be just OK. A diverse cast that includes Forrest Whitaker?  and Keegan Michael Key as a showboaty villain (the kind of role I think he was born to play)??  singing musical numbers about toymaking produced by John Legend??? set in a *magical steampunk world* ???!?!?!? Maybe I hyped it up too much in my head, but this had SO MUCH potential and squandered maybe of 70% of it.

The musical numbers are really underwhelming once you get past the visuals. The choreo is incredible, the set design is incredible, and the voices singing the songs are really good, but the songs themselves are very repetitive and uninspiring, to the point that once you get past verse 1 + chorus you can and should fast forward through the next 3 minutes. If you saw this movie and thought the songs were good, try looking up the lyrics on genius and reading them with no music or visuals, and see if you still disagree with me.

I also strongly disliked how they interwove the magic system with math; if you want to be whimsical, *don't include math.* The ""square root of impossible"" does not equal a person; because square roots are a real thing, and they aren't magic. Why not just make the magic *magical?* Why do there have to be equations involved? It looks pretty when they're writing in the air, but in the end it doesn't make sense.

And that's really the theme of the movie: It's two full hours of stunning visuals, but take the tiniest peek behind those aesthetics, and you'll see it's all sizzle and no steak. And it sucks because I feel like if they just cut it down to 90 minutes, removed the math, and played only like 5 or 6 musical numbers but made them lyrically creative, the movie could have been a 12/10. I *really really* wanted to like Jingle Jangle, but it wasn't all the way there. ",10,8,1609549246.0,2021-01-02 01:00:46,True
venom2,venom sequel,koc4wf,Nearly 500 movies since March,"Tldr: my wife saw almost 500 new movies this year. 

Hello r/movies, it’s been a crazy year hasn’t it... Theaters are closed, production has (for the most part) ground to a halt and what was scheduled for release has moved to a streaming service or was delayed to next year or both. With the initial quarantine back in March starting I decided to take this unprecedented opportunity to give my wife the catch-up she desperately needed since she didn’t watch very many movies growing up. 

A little backstory, she grew up in a home where many movies were forbidden for religious reasons and as a result just never became a cinephile. She saw many Disney movies and a few random others but missed a vast majority of cinemas best (and worst). On the flip side I grew up near a regular theater and a dollar theater and saw a ton of films as a kid and teen, I’d regularly go on weekends or skip school for a triple feature or catch the last showing of something every night of the week. 

We’ve been together for almost 11 years now and she would go see anything and everything with me. All the Marvel movies, action comedies, sci fi, animation, whatever... but her movie knowledge is fairly contained within the last decade. So when I got laid off and she began working from home we decided to see how many new movies we could see during this Covid mess. 

We defined “New” as anything we had both never seen or anything she had never seen and I hadn’t seen in 10+ years since we met. Since mid March we have managed to watch 500 movies and in the process learn a few things about her individual tastes and the kinds of movies we enjoy watching as a couple the most. I’m going to drop a list of everything we saw, after the list I’ll highlight a few hidden gems we both loved...

I’ve noticed that my wife seems to prefer old movies to new ones (overall). Some Like It Hot became an instant favorite for her... She also loved seeing things like Freaks or the Hitchcock films that get referenced a lot. She’s like Captain America pointing out all the references she gets now. We also found out she loves James Bond (mostly older ones), she doesn’t hate Will Farrell as much as she thought (or at all really), she loves bad/old/obscure movies, scary movies aren’t as scary as she thought they’d be, and that she’s basically Jennifer Anniston’s character from Office Space with her crazy love for old Kung Fu. 

As far as random recommendations my wife wanted to shout out all the Falcon films, Our Man Flint and In Like Flint, and Tammy & The T-Rex. I wanted to shout out The Forbidden Kingdom, Dr Goldfoot and The Bikini Girls & Dr Goldfoot and The Girl Bombs, and Old Dracula. If anybody wants to just talk movies I always welcome 

I can’t wait to expand her movie history in this coming year, there’s always plenty of bad obscure movies but now that she is into it it’s time to bring out the heavy hitters. Godfather, Jaws, Alien, Citizen Cane, Clockwork Orange, 2001 A Space Odyssey and more are still in the pipeline... If you’re still with me here I want to sincerely thank you for reading about our journey this year. I love you r/movies, and I hope y’all have a wonderfully cinematic 2021.",7,4,1609511397.0,2021-01-01 14:29:57,True
venom2,venom sequel,iemvmx,My guide to understanding Metacritic scores,"Apparently there's some weird fanboy panic over ""Tenent"" scoring 71/100 on Metacritic, despite the fact that Christopher Nolan's other movies:  Insomnia (78/100), Batman Begins (70/100), The Prestige (66/100), Inception (74/100), Dark Knight Rises (78/100), Interstellar (74/100).    A movie that scores in the 70s represents widespread approval and is well in line with what you can expect from a typical Nolan blockbuster.  Rarely regarded as critically acclaimed masterpieces (really only Dunkirk scored over 90), but always well-liked.  Compare that to a director like Zack Snyder who has literally never made a movie that's scored over 59/100.  Most of his movies end up in the 40s.  His movies still have a fandom regardless. 

I didn't understand this panic. I saw u/AaronWYL make a comment that I think summed it up:

> **Seems like the gamer mentality spilling over into movies.** For a long time now in gaming anything below a 9 is unacceptable for a beloved top tier game. A game being rated 7...shit, you might as well throw it in the garbage.

I hadn't considered this and I think he nailed it.  You see, back in the day when we'd open up a newspaper to look at a movie review, movies would often be scored on a 4 star scale.  This continues today.  A movie might score 3/4 stars and you'd go ""oh damn, that sounds like it's going to be great"".   Another might score 2.5/4 stars and you'd go ""oh, that sounds like mixed reviews, but above average... maybe I'll give it a shot."" 

**Quick note on RottenTomatoes vs Metacritic.**  The standard ""tomatometer"" kind of sucks.  All it's showing is the percentage of critics that didn't completely hate a movie.  They convert all scores to a ""thumbs up/thumbs down"" and tell you what percentage didn't give it thumbs down.  Metacritic, on the flip side, converts every score to a 1/100 scale (regardless of it's a 4 star scale, a A-F scale, a 1-10 scale, etc) and tries to average it out.   If literally every critic scored a movie 2.5 out of 4 stars, the Tomatometer would call that ""100% certified fresh!"" while metacritic would call that 62.5/100.   Rotten tomatoes literally doesn't show you critical consensus.  Metacritic at least makes an attempt, and I've always appreciated it for that.

So yeah... that 3 star movie = 75/100.    That 2 star movie = 50/100.   Quite different than a video game where they pretty much always rate things on a 1/100 scale initially and anything rated under 80 would raise red flags.

**Here's how I look at metacritic scores for movies:**

* 90-100:  This is likely some kind of masterpiece.  These are rare.  Some of the greatest movies of all time score in this range.  

* 80-100:  Most Oscar contenders score in the 80s.  If a movie clears 80, it represents widespread critical acclaim.  Basically must-see.

* 70-80:  This still represents very favorable reviews (think 3 out of 4 stars).  Most of the very best Marvel movies score in this range.  Guardians of the Galaxy (78), Thor Ragnorok (74), Captain America Civil War (75).  Nolan's movies mostly fall in this range.   A widespread broad audience should enjoy movies here regardless of genre.  For instance, I hate the Horror genre, but I'll show up for a Horror movie that scores in this range (such as ""Cabin in the Woods"" and ""Invisible Man""... both of which scored 72/100 and I ended up liking)   

* 60-70:  Ok, these movies are still pretty decent, but if you HATE the genre, you might want to avoid it.  I hate horror movies, so I'm probably avoiding a horror in this range.  I love super-hero movies so when ""Ant-Man"" scores 64/100 I know I'll probably dig it... but if you find that genre childish, you might want to skip it.  Hate dumb action flicks?  Maybe avoid Hobbs & Shaw (60/100), but otherwise you'll probably enjoy it.

* 50-60:  This is the range where if it's your favorite genre, you may still love it.  Big Snyder fanboy?  You might come away thinking ""Man of Steel"" (55/100) is perfect for you.  Love comedy horror?  ""Happy Death Day"" (58/100) is right in your wheelhouse.  Can't get enough of Sci-Fi?  ""Alita: Battle Angel"" (53/100) might end up your favorite movie of the year.  If these aren't your genre... you might kinda hate these films.

* 40-50:  This is the range that I'd recommend totally avoiding unless it's your favorite genre or you're already obsessed with the characters.   ""Batman v Superman 44/100"".   ""Justice League"" 45/100.  ""Suicide Squad"" 40/100.   Most will think they are trash, but if you ride or die for movies Snyder touches, you'll probably defend them to the death.  I'm a big comedy fan... so I'm down with watching a stupid comedy in this range.  ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" (44/100) is dumb as hell, but I love the genre so I dug it.

* 30-40:  Yikes territory.  Unless you're like... ALL ABOUT this genre, you probably will think it sucks.  Like... Sorry, but ""Venom"" (35/100) sucked, but if you can't get enough of Superhero movies, you might come away enjoying it.   The Dumb and Dumber sequel (36/100) was trash, but I'm all about Jim Carrey movies so I was totally fine with it.   Totally obsessed with scifi fantasy adventure family movies... maybe you'll find something redeemable in ""Artemis Fowl"" (31/100)

* 0-30 - Some of the worst movies ever made.  Avoid unless you're willing to do a lot of drugs beforehand.  That said, taste is subjective regardless of consensus quality.  I once went on a couple movie dates with a girl who couldn't stop laughing during ""The Love Guru"" (24/100), but hated ""Wall-E"" (95/100). It totally changed how I saw her as a person, but people are gonna like what they are gonna like.


Anyways... sounds like this latest Nolan movie is pretty good.  Can't wait to see it.",22,17,1598118331.0,2020-08-22 18:45:31,True
venom2,venom sequel,gkwu6z,Will hollywood movies become extinct by 2025?,"A lot of sequels/franchises seem to be coming to an end by 2024. 

Assuming jurassic world will have 2 more films, one will come out in 2021 and one probably in 2024. After that I doubt there will be another jurassic movie.

FF 9 will come out in 2021 and FF 10 in 2023. I doubt there will be another FF movie.

MI 7 and MI8 will be out in 2022 and 2023. will there be another one after that? I doubt so.

Venom 3 and 4 in 2022 and 2024 respectively. I doubt there will be another one after that.

There might be another james bond in 2024. After that, I don't think so.

There will be one more incredibles and minions movie. I doubt there will be another one after that.

Avatar 2 and 3 and 4 in 2021, 2023 and 2025. Will there be another avatar movie after that?

So...by 2025 all franchises could come to an end. What will be left is small budgeted movies. I doubt people will go to movie theaters to watch them. VR headsets will become good by then that people will prefer watching them directly OTT on those headsets.",0,24,1589644207.0,2020-05-16 16:50:07,True

venom2,venom sequel,g5ytbk,Venom (2018) had massive potential!,"With the news dropping regarding the new Venom sequel and it's title, it got me thinking about the first film. The more I think about it and watch clips from it, the more I've realised how amazing that film could have been. Before I start don't get me wrong I still enjoyed the first film!  

It's general knowledge by now that a lot of the initial script and scenes that we're shot ended up being left out of the final cut and that these scenes were ""some of Tom Hardy's favourite parts of the film"". This makes sense to me if you think about the films that Tom Hardy makes and the scripts he choses to be a part of. 

Hardy has a great track record for picking not only interesting scripts but also picking really interesting characters from Bane in The Dark Knight Rises and Max in Mad Max:Fury Road to John Fitzgerald in The Revenant, Forrest Bondurant in Lawless and Tommy Conlon in Warrior. The list goes on but I can't help but think that the Eddie Brock that Hardy read in the script was a much more complicated and interesting character than what we saw on screen. 

My second point is just regarding the R rating which I think most people agree on when we say the film would have worked better with a hard R rating. I get that all comic book films can't be R rated and that Sony made a calculated choice, especially since the film still earned 850 million. But again just watching some of the badass fight and action scenes I can't help but think how awesome and more importantly fitting to the story it could have been watching Venom do some serious damage. It would have hammered down how dangerous this character was instead of portraying that he only ever knocks guys unconscious and slags Eddie all the time. I know he straight up eats a guy in the end but not even a drop of blood in the store? Come on Sony. 

 Anyway, I am excited for the sequel but a little part of me will be thinking watching it could the first film have gone down as gritty gore infested classic like Logan or Deadpool. I mean come on if you're gong to have any complex character fight with his inners demons while leaving a trail of absolute carnage behind him (Yes pun intended) it's going to be Venom.",0,9,1587551810.0,2020-04-22 11:36:50,True

venom2,venom sequel,dh6kwx,My 2020 Worldwide Box Office Predictions,"As 2019 is shaping out to be perhaps the biggest year in box office history, 2020 almost seems like nothing compared to it. This can mainly be pointed to Disney having a relatively weak slate, which is really saying something considering their slates in recent years. As for the other studios, it's all up for grabs, as this will be the first time in the last few years that they have a chance to attempt to match or even dethrone Disney. Below are my predictions for the top 15 films.

1. Black Widow | Disney | $1.20 billion
2. Fast and Furious 9 | Universal | $1.15 billion
3. Minions: The Rise of Gru | Universal | $1.08 billion
4. The Eternals | Disney | $1.06 billion
5. Wonder Woman 1984 | WB | $1.04 billion
6. Tenet | WB | $1.02 billion
7. No Time To Die | MGM | $910 million
8. Mulan | Disney | $820 million
9. Onward | Disney | $760 million
10. Venom II | Sony | $740 million
11. Birds of Prey | WB | $680 million
12. Godzilla vs. Kong | WB| $650 million
13. Jungle Cruise | Disney | $620 million
14. Raya and the Last Dragon | Disney | $540 million
15. Dune | WB | $500 million

So it currently appears that despite Disney probably set to have their weakest year in recent times, they will still dominate the box office list as Black Widow appears to outgross every other film releasing next year. Even though it appears to be the weakest film in Phase 4 in terms of box office, it doesn't seem like any other film is strong enough to overtake it. Coming off her major role in Avengers: Endgame, the biggest film in history, and the fact that Marvel fans would have waited almost a year for a new MCU film, it seems like Black Widow will be the highest grossing film of 2020. As for the second Marvel film releasing next year, The Eternals, it looks like Kevin Feige will have another franchise in a franchise with the introduction of a slew of new characters. The Marvel brand has never been bigger and the promise of insane visuals, Angelina Jolie and the reunion of Jon and Robb almost ensures that the film will pass the billion dollar mark. 

As for Disney's other films for 2020, the live action remake of Mulan should be set to rake in the cash, however, the controversies surrounding it and the exclusion of the greatest Disney character of all time Mushu (/s) will halter the film from reaching the heights of its peers, The Jungle Book, Aladdin and Beauty of the Beast. As for Onward, Pixar have a good track record of delivering, and it seems like the Chris Pratt and Tom Holland animation will be no exception, grossing a similar amount to Pixar's last original film, Coco. As for the animation studio's second film this year Soul, I predict that it will end up being The Good Dinosaur 2.0, where it is overshadowed by another Pixar film that year, a la Finding Dory, which is why it doesn't appear on this list. If this occurs, it would be best for Pixar to just focus on one film a year. Furthermore, Raya and the Last Dragon might be able to make some noise as Disney Animation have had multiple successes in the past such as Frozen, Moana and Zootopia. This is difficult to predict since we haven't seen any promotion for the film yet, but reading the synopsis and considering their track record, just above $500 million seems like a good bet for now. As for Jungle Cruise, the trailer seems promising with Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt looking great in their roles which should allow the film to succeed, but it will likely be far off from the success of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.

Moving on to Warner Brothers, it appears that DC will remain its most consistent inconsistent franchise as both Wonder Woman 1984 and Birds of Prey are blessed with great release dates and should be set to succeed. Wonder Woman 1984 should be able to outgross her first outing if the film is similar in quality and the lack of competition should allow it to break the billion mark. As for Birds of Prey, a Valentine's Day release should allow it to make money, however I don't expect it to outgross 2016's Suicide Squad. Moreover, it is a shame that Godzilla vs. Kong is so low, however, the underperformance of Godzilla: King of the Monsters has left me not nearly as enthusiastic for the film as I was back when Kong: Skull Island kinda overperformed. Despite that, anything above Skull Island's $566 million should be considered decent, but as the Avengers level film for the MonsterVerse, its safe to say that the Kaiju Cinematic Universe is in a pretty shitty position. Now, onto my two most hyped films for 2020, I am particularly biased as I really do hope both Tenet and Dune are great success. Christoper Nolan's next sci-fi action similar to Inception is ready to perform similarly in the box office. Nolan is one of the few names in Hollywood that guarantees box office cash, and it is quite likely that Tenet is able to cross the billion mark. As for Dennis Villeneuve, after Blade Runner 2049 bombed, it can be easy to dismiss Dune's box office chances, but I am particularly optimistic on it doing well thanks to the insane cast and it being a bit more mainstream than BR2049. 

The third major studio, Universal has a similar slate to its summer releases in 2015, and I expect that the sequels to its two highest grossing films that year will perform similarly. The Fast and Furious brand has become quite consistent at hitting a billion, as the last two instalments have, and I expect Furious 9 to be no different. Hobbs and Shaw didn't perform on par but I believe the return of Vin Diesel and Co. and a relatively barren summer will allow for the film to outgross Fast 8. As for the sequel of Minions, the Despicable Me franchise has consistently delivered and once again, The Rise of Gru should be no exception. Every year, theres always one animated film that pops up high in the Top 10, and this film will be this years animation representative.

As for the two films on the list that aren't repped by one of the big 3, James Bond's No Time To Die and Tom Hardy's Venom II should have similar box office returns as their previous instalments. For the former, Spectre numbers are more likely than Skyfall numbers, but the addition of Rami Malek and the simple but fucking banger of a teaser poster and title just makes me optimistic for the film, which is why I believe it will end up in the middle of Craig's last two outings. As for the latter, Venom was one of the biggest surprises in 2018 and I expect its sequel to perform similarly, but I would assume it isn't able to outgross the first one.

Honourable mentions of films that didn't appear include Soul, Top Gun: Maverick, Bad Boys for Life, Dolitte, Free Guy, A Quite Place: Part II, Artemis Fowl, The Conjuring 3, Bloodshot, Death on the Nile, Uncharted and The Croods II. I predict films to all end up between $300 and $500 million, which is the reason why they didn't make the cut.

**TL;DRL:** Even though Disney is going to have its worst year in recent times, it will still fucking dominate over all the other studios in this weak ass year. All hail the House of Mouse.",0,27,1570945064.0,2019-10-13 06:37:44,True

venom2,venom sequel,ctzffx,"In light of the recent Sony/Spider-Man drama, it’s worth looking at Sony’s recent history with franchises (since 2010)","Sony has always been looking to have a stable of franchises - they are in a tough spot compared to other major studios. Only a few of their properties are widely recognized, basically just Spider Man and James Bond. The others are quite a bit more niche, like Hotel Transylvania or Men in Black. The last 10 years are littered with failed franchise attempts, reboots, or squandered opportunities. Here is the state of Sony Pictures since 2010, as told by some of their attempted franchises.

* Men In Black (2012, 2019): Beloved franchise from the early 2000s. Sony’s attempt at #3 ~10-15 years later was not a financial success. Neither was the franchise reboot - a Thor and Valkyrie team-up movie. Sounds good on paper, though! (I had to check to verify that this movie had already come out - yes, it did. Maybe by June 2019 people only wanted Fat Hemsworth.)

* James Bond (2012, 2015): Skyfall’s huge success surprised Sony executives, who scrambled to retain the director (Sam Mendes) for the next Bond movie, and ended up paying gobs of money to bribe him to stay - he wanted a break. His next movie, Spectre, was a critical and commercial disappointment. Until recently the next Bond was still in limbo as an important anniversary year, i.e., normally an easy cash-in opportunity, approaches. 

* Adam Sandler movies (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015): Sandler has moved on to Netflix now, but he had a pretty stunning run of awful movies at Sony (Jack and Jill, Grown Ups, That’s My Boy, Pixels, etc).

* 21 Jump Street (2012, 2014): These movies are great - but where does Sony go from here? Apparently nowhere. Maybe they should have went with the Men In Black crossover after all. 

* Spider-Man (2012, 2014): Like every other studio, after the success of Avengers, Sony was stretching to create a Cinematic Universe. They attempted to spin the Amazing Spider-Man reboot into a Cinematic Universe - but just of spider-man’s villains... However, Amazing Spider-Man 2 couldn’t get its own villains off the ground, and couldn’t match the 1 billion dollar gross that Sony set as a goal (which doesn’t sound too unrealistic today in the midst of the post-Disney-monopalypse billions, but was a terrible miscalculation by Sony executives who expected audiences to show up to a Spider-Man sequel whether or not it was good). In an extremely unusual & humiliating arrangement, Sony canceled its villain movie plans (and its Aunt May standalone spin-off movie - yes, really), and gave Marvel Studios creative control of Spider-Man. Sony would pay production costs of Marvel spider-man stand-alone movies, and any profit from these movies would go to Sony. Marvel can use Spider-Man in its movies as a supporting character with impunity. Sony can still make its own non-MCU movies with other characters from the Spider-Man catalog.

* Total Recall (2012): Remake of beloved-ish? 80s sci-fi action movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger - with Colin Farrell in Arnold’s place. Sounds great to me! But it wasn’t, and it bombed hard. 

* RoboCop (2014): Remake of beloved 80s action movie which was loved for its pulpy violence and political commentary.... remade as a sanitized PG13 meh-fest, and potential franchise starter, that bombed critically and commercially.

* After Earth (2013): Will Smith was like, “Hey Sony - my son is great, give him a job!” Sony said, “Your son is great!” and put him in this movie. They were both wrong.

* 3 Smurfs Movies (2011, 2013, 2017): Maybe these movies are good! I haven’t seen them. I believe Katy Perry is the voice of one of the recurring smurfs, and I like that Justin Timberlake song. So maybe this is a Sony Franchise success. 

* Angry Birds Movie (2016, 2019): Another sony attempt at a franchise starter that didn’t connect with audiences. The recent sequel is now the best-reviewed video game movie of all time! But at this point, Angry Birds is a relic of 2010 and the sequel looks to be a mild flop. 

* Ghostbusters remake (2016): Yet another franchise starter attempt - you know the story on this one. At the time Sony executives were defiant re: the box office numbers, saying, “this movie is a huge success - look at all the free publicity!” But yeah, they’re not making a sequel, because it didn’t make money. They are, however, trying ANOTHER reboot, directed by the original director’s son..... We’ll see. 

* Dark Tower (2017): Attempt at Stephen King franchise that people have been waiting for for decades - when it finally came out it was a huge mess that fizzled hard.

* Jumanji 2 (2017): At the time, was at the tail end of Sony’s string of failed reimaginings of classic movies. Executives by this point had given up on making this a franchise starter and let the creative team make controversial decisions (like an emphasis on the non-celebrity high school characters) - which was good for the movie but Sony of 2012 would have nixed. Ultimately it was hoped that this movie would just make its money back and Sony’d move on. Instead, the film was a massive hit, and Sony scrambled to get plans in place for a sequel.  

* Venom (2018): Long in development, with the final product looking nothing like what Tom Hardy signed on for. Ultimately middle school boys all agreed that this movie was awesome anyway, and it was a success commercially (although not critically). A sequel is on the way, and all it took was Tom Hardy swallowing his acting scruples and just taking his paycheck. Concerningly, Venom’s “success” may have convinced the Sony executive team that actually, they’re all really smart, and maybe they should have been as involved in the Into the SpiderVerse movie as they were with Venom.

* Girl in the Spider’s Web (2018): The first Girl with the Dragon Tattoo movie was good, and a modest success 10 years ago... the next entry in the franchise was last year, based on a book not written by the series’ original author (even though there were two of the original books still remaining to be made into movies) and a we-hope-you-won’t-notice recasting of the main character. Well, no one noticed this movie coming out, except book fans who felt annoyed.

* Into the Spider-Verse (2018): Before the release of Venom, someone at Sony seemed to have recognized that their executive team has no idea what they’re doing with the Spider Man property, and decided to give the creatives a chance. A hands-off approach was taken for this wacky idea from the creative mind of Phil Lord (the Lego Movie and 21 Jump Street), with decisions that would have once been unthinkable: Peter Parker as only a supporting character (and also as a pancaked character, depending on the universe). The resulting critical success may further go to Sony executives’ heads - “I did this!” “Listen to my great idea for a standalone Jamie-Foxx-as-Electro movie”... “Let’s make Spider-Verse 2 be a rom com!”

venom2,venom sequel,cba52a,The whole Spiderman deal actually makes sense for Sony. They technically don't need Marvel anymore. They can sign Watts for the sequel and just re-sign the screenwriters to make the third one. Marvel is preventing characters like Morbius and Venom from spiderman movies.,Sony is trying to build their own cinematic universe and they have a legitimate hit with Venom which when I saw it twice in theaters it played huge both times. Audiences like Tom Hardy as the character. Naturally Sony wants Venom and Spiderman to co-exist in the same universe because naturally they would want to do a sinister six movie and have them team up.  There's no way Sony is going to be able to do that if Marvel is still controlling every aspect of the IP.,0,68,1562722599.0,2019-07-10 02:36:39,True
venom2,venom sequel,bqdfup,"Hello there, I have a little thought I want to through out there. As a little experiment to all of those who find my post. what is your Fan Cinematic Universe? ( and I don't mean like something someone photoshopped In image)","And what I mean by this is an idea thought up by a YouTuber named Patrick (H) Willems, and in his video about Cinematic Universe. He listed a bunch of movies about the space race, Kennedy Assassination to Nixon Watergate. And also a collection of movie that the comment section was talking about alway, like a trilogy of Scottish History, To an extended franchise of the American Civil War.

But my idea is about movies you (or anyone) thinks that connected. like a certain character from one movie is the main character in another one. An example of this thought up and looked about online is that Gerald Bulter character from Law Abiding Citizen is the Joker from The Dark Knight. Or The movie Life (2017) is a prequel to Venom. Another good example, which is very vague about wanting to be connected to it or not; is that Kurt Russel Soldier is set in Blade Runner. my personal favorites to watch my version of the Dark Universe; which includes, both of the Mummy movies (the original 90's one with the two sequels and the new one) with the five Scorpion King movies, Van Helsing, Werewolf: The Beast Among Us, Red Riding Hood (Because I think its alright), The Prophecy, Dracula Untold, The musical Phantom of the Opera, Disney's Huntchback, I, Frankenstein, and Shape of Water. But Here comes the fun part, I watch them in chronological order by the setting of the movie itself. From The Scorpion King 2 to the Tom Cruise Mummy movie. Even though all my movie choices wouldn't make sense anyway, it's still a fun watch to do. 

Its something like that anyway, It just a little brain teaser for how you like to Marathon your movies.",0,5,1558245343.0,2019-05-19 06:55:43,True
venom2,venom sequel,b16swo,Venom (2018)...actually liked it,"Which surprised me.  After a friend cancelled our drink in favour of sex with his girlfriend (understandable) I decided to stay in and read a book.  Remembering that Venom wasn't supposed to be very good I had it playing in the background. Ended up watching it all the way through and when I saw the end credits scene was excited to see the sequel.  I really can't understand the negativity.  I thought it was a great, dumb, fun, action movie, reminiscent of an 80s buddy-movie (maybe the fact that Brock and Venom become friends appealed to me as my own friend had blown me off in favour of his girl).",18,61,1552602535.0,2019-03-14 22:28:55,True
venom2,venom sequel,as5ky7,Will we ever see another David Fincher movie. Are superhero movies to blame?,"Since 2014 David Fincher has directed 6 Tv episodes. 

&#x200B;

David Fincher is my favorite director and it pains me how unproductive he has been in the past few years. Two of his projects, Utopia (tv series reboot for Amazon) and World War Z (movie sequel for Paramount) have been scrapped due to the fact that he and the network/studio couldn’t agree on the necessary budget. 

&#x200B;

In the years from 2007-2014 Fincher was very productive as he directed a total of *five* movies in the span of *eight* years. 

&#x200B;

In terms of getting his projects made I believe Fincher was born 10-20 years to late. The studios today only seem to be interested in making low budget, high upside horror films or gigantic budget superhero movies. The $60-90 million original idea  movie is dying and that is the sweet spot for creative and ambitious film making. Those movies are now deemed not worthy of marketing due to a low upside. 

&#x200B;

If the movie with the medium budget is a likely Oscars contender, the studios might talk themselves into financing it but given Finchers flare for the perverted and at times grotesque let's just say he's not the Oscars golden boy. He lost to Tom Hooper's  ""King's Speech"" mostly due to Harvey Weinstein''s pull in the industry (that aged well) in 2011 and to Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire in 2009. 

&#x200B;

The limbo that we are in right now while we are stuck in between the rise of the streaming services and the fall of the Studio system is having the affect that highly decorated and creative directors are having a hard time getting their projects greenlit. No wonder when 6 of the top 10 grossing movies of 2018 are fucking superhero movies, and nr 11 is also a superhero movie (Venom) . 

&#x200B;

I can only imagine how many great movies we have missed out on because their budget was gobbled up by the 15th superhero movie released that year. ",0,15,1550545056.0,2019-02-19 02:57:36,True
